Execution file:
	calculateVector.py :- prepare data for processing (You don't need to run, all results is in the dropbox below)
	retrieveLabeled.py :- retrieve classes and fines (You don't need to run, all results is in the raw_data folder)
	NER.ipynb :- expirment process (You don't need to run, unless you want to have a look at the process of generating the dataset)
        *process_data.py :- prepare data for CNN (Change some code for your CNN), run as below, you should give the file that you want to run.
			You should also down load the dataset below(dropbox share folder) into the same directory of process_data.py

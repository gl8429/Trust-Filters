Happy Saturday!</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1044\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/geek-girl-tattoo-wall-inkbluesky.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1044\" alt=\"Photo from inkbluesky.wordpress.com\" src=\"https://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/geek-girl-tattoo-wall-inkbluesky.png?w=640&#038;h=480\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo from inkbluesky.wordpress.com</p></div>\n<p>So in honor of Youtube&#8217;s Geek Week, I decided to compile a list of reasons why dating a geek girl is the best decision you could possibly make in your lifetime. Because let&#8217;s be real&#8230; we&#8217;re the shit.</p>\n<p>1. She can help you with your homework. Whether she&#8217;s really good at science, math, or literature, she is savvy in her area of expertise and can help you pass that class, yo.</p>\n<p>2. She is a walking, living, and convenient encyclopedia. Chances are she&#8217;s a huge fan of something &#8211; whether it&#8217;s anime, video games, sci-fi, comic books, etc, and she will know EVERYTHING there is to that genre. Need a new video game to play? She&#8217;ll know what the latest releases are AND the reviews. Bam.</p>\n<p>3. She ain&#8217;t afraid to walk into a comic book store. Fck those comic book staff that judge her. She&#8217;s still gonna buy the latest issue of Spiderman.</p>\n<p>4. Video game nights make the perfect date.</p>\n<p>5. You can have an enlightening and riveting conversation with her about almost any social issue since she&#8217;ll be up to date with current events.</p>\n<p>6. Fan meet ups, cosplay gatherings, video game tournaments? Yeah, she&#8217;ll not only accompany you, but she&#8217;ll participate in them.</p>\n<p>7. COSPLAY. Enough said.</p>\n<p>8. She is up to date on the latest technology and she&#8217;ll have a well thought out opinion on different products.</p>\n<p>9. You now have someone who can make terrible puns with you and think it&#8217;s hilarious. Han Solo? I think you mean, Han TAKEN!</p>\n<p>10. Again, COSPLAY. Enough said.</p>\n<p>Think I missed any? Add some more reasons in the comments! :)\u00a0Happy Geek Week! Check out Youtube this week to watch some awesome videos.</p>\n<p>-Alice</p>\n", "post_id": 1020, "location": false, "date": "08-03-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["geek week", "Youtube Geek Week", "30 day blogging challenge", "30 day challenge", "Youtube", "jenna marbles"], "text": "<p>Hey guys! Happy Sunday Funday!</p>\n<p>Hope your week has been swell and if you were one of the lucky thousands to be at VidCon this weekend, fck you.</p>\n<p>Just kidding. But if you went to VidCon this weekend, let me know how it went! <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-bigsmile' title=':D'>:D</span></p>\n<p>Anyways, today&#8217;s challenge is about who I would want to switch lives with for a day and why. I&#8217;m going to tweak the challenge a bit and instead of switching lives, we&#8217;re going to call it &#8220;Take-Your-Fan-to-Work Day.&#8221;</p>\n<p>When it comes down to it, I don&#8217;t want to &#8220;switch lives&#8221; with someone, even if it was for a day. I like who I am and I couldn&#8217;t imagine being someone else. In all honesty, I would probably fck up their life in those 24 hours. (C&#8217;mon&#8230; I&#8217;ve seen Freaky Friday.) So I&#8217;d rather be given the opportunity to hang out with them for 24 hours. Like, let&#8217;s be best friends for 24 hours. Doesn&#8217;t that sound much better?! Then you can instagram that shit.</p>\n<p>The person I&#8217;d love to be best friends with for 24 hours is the one and only&#8230; Jenna Marbles.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 306px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/jennamarbles.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image\" id=\"i-1054\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/jennamarbles.jpg?w=296&#038;h=296\" width=\"296\" height=\"296\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo from <a href=\"http://www.fanpop.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.fanpop.com</a></p></div>\n<p>So for you unfortunate and sad souls who don&#8217;t know who this awesome girl is, Jenna Marbles is one of the top Youtubers today with over 10 million subscribers. She&#8217;s got a brash, tell-it-like-it-is personality that I can&#8217;t help but love and admire. She mostly does vlogs, which is why I aspire to be like her. She&#8217;s super funny, down-to-earth, and helloo&#8230; she&#8217;s beautiful!</p>\n<p>The reason I would want to be her best friend for a day is because of how awesome she is. If you watch her videos, she&#8217;s so likable. She has this personality that&#8217;s infectious and it&#8217;s hard not to laugh at her jokes or want to be her friend. Or bang her. But in all seriousness, I feel like my humor is similar to her&#8217;s, so if I ever had a conversation with her, we would be able to hit it off.</p>\n<p>What would we do with our day together? Well, I&#8217;d let her decide.. after all, it&#8217;s &#8220;take-your-fan-to-work day.&#8221; But after she was done with whatever business she had to handle, I would just love to buy some pizza, mass amounts of hot cheetos, and two 6-packs of beer and just have a movie night. Or play video games. I don&#8217;t know what video games she&#8217;s into, so I&#8217;m okay with just watching movies. But it&#8217;d have to be ridiculously funny movies that we can make drinking games to.</p>\n<p>So that would be my day with Jenna. Fun fact, during last year&#8217;s VidCon, she stopped by my Starbucks. I UNFORTUNATELY wasn&#8217;t working so I had the displeasure of hearing it from my coworkers. And they&#8217;re not even big fans of her&#8217;s, so I was like &#8220;WHY FATE WHYYY?!&#8221; Fate trolled me so hard that day. As it does every other day. Le sigh.</p>\n<p>Question of the Day: Who would you switch lives with?</p>\n<p>In case you didn&#8217;t read yesterday&#8217;s blog post, Happy Geek Week! It&#8217;s Geek Week on Youtube and there&#8217;s going to be awesome nerdy content being uploaded everyday for a week! WOOO! So check that shit out.</p>\n<p>In honor of Geek Week, I, too will be posting some geeky articles for you to enjoy. I already started yesterday with my post &#8220;<a href=\"http://alicevega.com/2013/08/03/10-reasons-why-you-should-date-a-geek-girl/\" target=\"_blank\">10 Reasons to Date a Geek Girl</a>&#8221; so check that out if you haven&#8217;t already. <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)</span></p>\n<p>-Alice</p>\n", "post_id": 1046, "location": false, "date": "08-04-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["geek week", "Youtube Geek Week", "Black Widow", "Geek Girls", "video games", "conventions", "Lara Croft", "anime", "comic books", "SDCC", "manga", "comic con"], "text": "<p>Hey guys! Happy Monday!</p>\n<div style=\"width: 406px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/406px-blackwidow2_indigograce.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image\" id=\"i-1066\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/406px-blackwidow2_indigograce.jpg?w=396&#038;h=418\" width=\"396\" height=\"418\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo from indigograce.wordpress.com</p></div>\n<p>I recently read this article from <a href=\"http://www.xojane.com/entertainment/michelle-rodriguez-women-who-rock-panel-comic-con?utm_medium=facebook\" target=\"_blank\">xojane.com</a> about how a fellow fan was so captivated and moved during a panel at this year&#8217;s SDCC. The panel featured actresses involved in Marvel movies and they spoke about something a little out of the ordinary to address at conventions: sexism. When the moderator asked, &#8220;what was the most egregious example of sexism you&#8217;ve seen on set?&#8221; EVERY actress had a story to tell.</p>\n<p>And for this, I&#8217;m glad. Mind you the audience for this panel was 85% white males who obviously can&#8217;t identify with this kind of discrimination in the workplace. After reading this article, I felt so proud to be a woman and I felt so compelled to write this post.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve kept up with my blog thus far, then you know I&#8217;m a proud Geek Girl. If you don&#8217;t know what a Geek Girl is&#8230; well&#8230; let me fill you in. We&#8217;re the minority in this fandom. Why? Because this fandom is still being controlled by men who feel this is still a &#8220;Boys-Only-Club.&#8221; Now I&#8217;m not trying to say EVERY man is this way. I&#8217;m just stating that most are and it creates a schism in our community. A community that&#8217;s supposed to be welcoming and open to everyone, regardless of ethnicity, sexuality, gender, and age. But alas&#8230; here we are in the year 2013 and we still see this shit happening.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/tomb-raider-2013-outfits.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image\" id=\"i-1072\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/tomb-raider-2013-outfits.jpg?w=630&#038;h=320\" width=\"630\" height=\"320\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo from videogamesblogger.com</p></div>\n<p>I&#8217;m not trying to say that I hate all the females in comic books, I&#8217;m just merely saying we need more female LEADS. For instance, take Lara Croft here. She&#8217;s one of the few successful female leads in a video game series. I admire her, as I do with my other favorite female super hero, Katniss Everdeen from The Hunger Games. We need more females characters like THIS! Strong, determined women who tenaciously achieve their goals. Now that&#8217;s a story worth writing.</p>\n<p>And why do we need them as the LEAD versus just another supporting character? Because the whole series/video game surrounds the main character&#8217;s life! You get to understand the complexity of the character and see that character&#8217;s vulnerable points, which is what makes that character so human and relatable to others. You don&#8217;t get those kinds of connections with supporting characters. I mean, why do you think people love Captain America so much? Because he was that scrawny kid from Brooklyn that had a heart of gold and wanted to protect others. A lot of people can identify with that.</p>\n<p>So my fellow readers&#8230; this argument I&#8217;m making ties in with the ever-going topic of &#8220;Fake Geek Girls.&#8221; That topic alone is for another time, but I&#8217;d just like to leave you with this &#8211; be open and welcoming to your fellow geeks. Don&#8217;t you fcking judge them if you don&#8217;t personally know them. Don&#8217;t we get that enough as fellow geeks? How many times do non-geeks look at you like you&#8217;re an alien when you start ranting about the latest video game releases or the latest comic books? And don&#8217;t act like you don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m talking about! We need to stick together and support our love for the fandom.</p>\n<p>So&#8230; don&#8217;t fck it up. Just be cool with everyone.</p>\n<p>-Alice</p>\n", "post_id": 1057, "location": false, "date": "08-06-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["geek week", "cosplay", "anime conventions", "nyan cat", "30 day challenge", "Youtube", "30 day blogging challenge", "goals", "dreams", "plans"], "text": "<p>Hey guys!

I know I&#8217;m totally basking in all these awesome geeky Youtube videos. I apologize for the delay in the Blog Challenge. It&#8217;s proving to be a difficult task pumping out 2 posts a day, especially when I work every night. But no worries, I promise to do better! Believe in me, senpai!</p>\n<p>(Yeah&#8230; things just got weird again. I just have a natural instinct to make things weird.)</p>\n<p>Before I get into the main topic of the post, I&#8217;d just like to note how freaky it is that the Blog Challenges have actually been on point with different events in my life. It&#8217;s like it knows what I&#8217;m doing&#8230; Did we just enter the Twilight Zone?</p>\n<p>Anyways, this summer has been one of the most eventful and life changing experiences in my short life. A lot of new things are happening&#8230; chapters closing, new doors opening. As much as I&#8217;m sad about the past, I&#8217;m just really excited for the future. Have you ever had that feeling? It&#8217;s so weird&#8230; like, how the hell am I supposed to feel? Sad? Happy? Both? How the hell do you feel both sad and happy at the same time?!</p>\n<p>With that being said, I have a couple goals I&#8217;m working toward in this very moment. One being this blog. Like I&#8217;ve said in previous posts, I&#8217;m not doing this for any monetary compensation. I&#8217;m blogging because I love to write and I love to make new friends who appreciate my work. It&#8217;s been an amazing 2 months so far, and I know things will only get better from here on out. I know I post stuff sporadically throughout the day, but I appreciate you still reading the content on this blog&#8230; whether you&#8217;re reading it at 3 AM or 3 PM.</p>\n<p>Which brings me to my second goal which I&#8217;m super excited to talk about&#8230; my Youtube channel! SO I know I currently only have 2 videos up (both of which are vlogs) but I finally decided a focus for the channel. If you follow my Twitter, I tweeted something about it earlier this evening. I&#8217;m meeting up with a friend tomorrow to start discussing the plans for this new endeavor, so just sit tight! I am planning to rock the shit out of your computer screen. It&#8217;s gonna be epic. Or so I hope.</p>\n<p>Third goal&#8230; Boogiezone! As I&#8217;ve said in previous posts, I&#8217;m really happy to be interning here. I&#8217;m actually planning on doing a lot for all the social media networks as well as editing content for the Youtube channel. I know.. it&#8217;s like, right up my alley, right?! AND I get to take classes for free. It&#8217;s a total win-win situation. By the way, if you&#8217;re a dancer and you happen to be free on Thursday nights, come take the Boogiezone Community Class at 9 PM! <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)</span> We feature different choreographers every week so it&#8217;s always a new style to try. Come get down with us.</p>\n<p>Fourth goal&#8230; Maid Cafe! I know Anime Expo just ended, but I already have some awesome ideas for next year. I can&#8217;t tell you guys too much, but just know that these ideas will hopefully be approved and we&#8217;re just gonna come back stronger than ever in 2014. Yeah, you best be ready to buy some tickets to our shows.</p>\n<p>As for general plans, I&#8217;m going into my VERY LAST SEMESTER OF COLLEGE EVER! I cannot wait for this shit to be done with. I just have 3 classes and I&#8217;m done forever! Just gotta beast mode it.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m also planning on attending some conventions! As of this moment, I will be at Comikaze AND Pacific Media Expo. I know I&#8217;m hella n00b and a bit rusty, but I AM planning to cosplay.</p>\n<p>WHAAAAT?! Ally cosplays?!</p>\n<p>Yes, I do. I&#8217;m not like a pro at it or anything, but I do. I just haven&#8217;t been cosplaying in recent years because well&#8230; all of my time and efforts went to my sorority and Maid Cafe. But I miss dressing up! If you&#8217;re planning on attending either convention, don&#8217;t be afraid to say hi to me! <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)</span></p>\n<p>As for what my DREAM is&#8230; well&#8230; I&#8217;m still kinda figuring that out. All I know is that I&#8217;m really happy where my life is right now. Blogging, vlogging, and dancing are what makes me happy. I&#8217;ll try to see if I can make a career out of that. If all else fails, I can always join the circus.</p>\n<p>-Alice</p>\n<p>OH and if you&#8217;re wondering why I put a Nyan Cat gif in this post&#8230; there&#8217;s no reason. I just love Nyan Cat.

But as I thought about it, I realized ALL my blog posts are geeky. Sooo, I guess the only difference between this week and every other week is that I&#8217;m just yelling &#8220;HAPPY GEEK WEEK!&#8221; in every post. Whatever, just celebrate with me, damnit!</p>\n<p>So I originally wanted to post this 3 days ago on National Friendship Day (Yes, it exists. Google it.) but that didn&#8217;t work out. So here I am! In honor of belated National Friendship Day, I want to talk to you guys about the magicalness that is My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic.</p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height:1.5;\">If you&#8217;re a fan of the show, GREAT! Hello my fellow Bronies and Pegasisters! If you don&#8217;t know what the hell I&#8217;m talking about, well, then this goes out to you.</span></p>\n<p>A year ago at Anime Expo, my best friend Angi cosplayed as Pinkie Pie. I&#8217;ll be honest, I really didn&#8217;t understand what the hype was about. I mean, MLP isn&#8217;t even anime. It&#8217;s a children&#8217;s show and it&#8217;s kinda cheesy. But hey, geeks flock to stuff like this so I guess I couldn&#8217;t be too surprised. After AX was over, I decided to watch the show to understand why it was so popular.</p>\n<p>I originally sat down to watch ONE episode, but then I found myself finishing the first season. (Thank you Netflix!) This shit was ADDICTING! And anyone who&#8217;s addicted to any TV show or anime will understand my feels. When there&#8217;s a plethora of episodes and seasons available for FREE (or for $8 a month), you HAVE to watch all of it. You can&#8217;t just stop in the middle&#8230; who does that?! That&#8217;s unAmerican.</p>\n<p>My Little Pony is an amazing show that teaches its viewers the magic of friendship. (See what I did there?!) But all corny jokes aside, this show really explores PLATONIC relationships between people..erm.. ponies, which a lot of children shows don&#8217;t tend to do anymore. Whether the lesson is about humility, sacrifice, or honesty, the show showcases all these lessons into colorful, fun, scenarios&#8230; WITH PONIES! It also addresses the issue of self identity. Each pony has something called a Cutie Mark. It&#8217;s a little emblem that appears near their butts (I don&#8217;t know how to make that sound politically correct) that define who you are. The six main characters of the show already have their Cutie Marks, but three supporting characters, Apple Bloom, Scootaloo, and Sweetie Belle, are on a quest to find theirs. In other words, these three young ponies are on a quest to discover who they are and what they can contribute to this world.</p>\n<p>See?! Aren&#8217;t these themes just so relevant in life?! I think this is an amazing show for ALL AGES! A lot of people criticize the fact that the viewer demographic has an abundance of males ages 12-35, but who the hell cares?! Those guys are awesome for watching the show and I bet you anything by learning these timeless lessons about friendship, these guys probably treat everyone with respect. WHICH IS WHAT THE SHOW IS ABOUT!</p>\n<p>My Little Pony has become such a phenomenon and has such a loyal and crazy fanbase that the fans have given each other names. I used them earlier, but let me explain. There are Bronies and Pegasisters. I mean, that&#8217;s as straightforward as you can get&#8230; Brony meaning fanboy and Pegasister meaning fangirl&#8230; but amongst this amazing community sparks a controversy in title. Before the name &#8220;Pegasister&#8221; came along, we just had the name &#8220;Brony.&#8221; So everyone, females and males, referred to themselves as Bronies. Some fans feel the term &#8220;Brony&#8221; should be gender neutral and we shouldn&#8217;t even be using the name &#8220;Pegasister.&#8221; I know this sounds crazy, but this is actually a big deal because this delves into a bigger, deeper rooted issue&#8230; gender binaries! Do people not want to be classified into &#8220;boys&#8221; and &#8220;girls&#8221;? Why does the term &#8220;Brony&#8221; sound better to some? What&#8217;s wrong with being classified as a female fan?</p>\n<p>Well, I honestly don&#8217;t have the answers to all these questions, but here&#8217;s my short 2 cents about the topic. The term &#8220;Brony&#8221; CAN&#8217;T be gender neutral because it&#8217;s derived from the word &#8220;brother.&#8221; I thought about this a lot yesterday and I have to admit I&#8217;m a subject of pushing the boundaries of gender binaries. I mean, I use the word &#8220;guys&#8221; a lot, to indicate that I&#8217;m talking to EVERYONE. But in reality, the term &#8220;guys&#8221; is NOT gender neutral&#8230; the word &#8220;guy&#8221; implies males. The reason it seems to be gender neutral is because we live in a patriarchal system.</p>\n<p>So what does this all mean? I basically just threw some shit at you to think about, obviously. Well for starters, I think I need to start using a different term in my blog posts. Does it make me sad? Eh&#8230; not really. If anything, it&#8217;s making me consciously think about my word choice. And I&#8217;m honestly not one of those people that&#8217;s gonna get all anal about it, but if anything, I hope I inspired you to think about these word choices: Brony vs. Pegasister. Does one connote more power and respect? Or are we thinking too much into this?</p>\n<p>But to reiterate my whole point, you should be watching My Little Pony. And if you have kids, you should DEFINITELY be showing them this show. There&#8217;s not a lot of good content for kids nowadays that won&#8217;t kill their brain cells. This show actually has thought-provoking concerns and issues that will teach our future generation how to be&#8230; Oh I don&#8217;t know&#8230; GOOD PEOPLE.</p>\n<p>And we need more of that in this world.</p>\n<p>-Alice</p>\n", "post_id": 1080, "location": false, "date": "08-07-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["geek week", "Youtube Geek Week", "cosplay", "pikachu", "Johto league", "indigo league", "anime", "Pokemon"], "text": "<p>Hello everyone! Happy Thursday!</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1085\" style=\"width: 330px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/pokemon.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1085\" alt=\"Photo from fanpop.com\" src=\"https://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/pokemon.jpg?w=320&#038;h=240\" width=\"320\" height=\"240\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo from fanpop.com</p></div>\n<p>So if you&#8217;re a 90&#8217;s kid like myself, you should have a special place in your heart for this anime. So what if the artwork and graphics aren&#8217;t top notch or that the story line isn&#8217;t original?! Whether you were a fan of the phenomenon or not, you can&#8217;t deny that Pokemon is one of the most successful and globally known anime from Japan.</p>\n<p>I remember I was in the 3rd grade when I watched my first episode. Like many other youngins&#8217;, I watched it on Kids WB (which is now the CW). I was so infatuated by these cute little creatures that had these kickass powers, that I wanted MORE of it. So I collected the trading cards, I played the video games (for Gameboy AND Nintendo 64), I collected the VHS tapes, I collected each soundtrack, I went to the premiere of the first movie, and the list goes on and on. I know I&#8217;m not the only one who did this, so you better be basking in your childhood too as you read this.</p>\n<p>The crazy thing about Pokemon is that the series IS STILL GOING ON til today. That&#8217;s insane! If you think about it, most anime shows only last an average of 20-ish episodes per season. If I watched this in 3rd grade, that means this show has been around for more than a decade. Wow. How many shows can you think of that can do the same thing? WITH constant video games coming out, soundtracks, movies, manga, etc? I&#8217;d like to argue, not a whole lot.</p>\n<p>To me, Pokemon doesn&#8217;t only bring out nostalgic memories for me&#8230; it represents this culture of nerdy fandom. I&#8217;m not ashamed to admit I still play the video games, I cosplay from the series, and I have a bunch of Pikachu plushies. There&#8217;s just something about it that doesn&#8217;t get old. I&#8217;m not a huge fan of all these new pokemon and these new series (I like to keep it old school) but I will always get excited and feel happy whenever I watch an episode from the Indigo or Johto Leagues. Or if I&#8217;m playing Pokemon Red/Blue/Yellow. Oh and just so you know&#8230; I&#8217;m down to battle if you are. I trained my Blastoise well.</p>\n<p>So what&#8217;s my point in all this? My point is that this anime is not just a kids&#8217; show&#8230; it&#8217;s LIFE and anyone regardless of their age should be able to enjoy it. I remember when I was really getting into anime. I was around 9 or 10-years-old and my mom would just tell my dad, &#8220;She&#8217;ll grow out of it one day.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Haha&#8230; oh Mother. That&#8217;s cute. You couldn&#8217;t be anymore wrong.</p>\n<p>My feelings toward Pokemon are still the same as my 3rd grade self. I ain&#8217;t afraid to say I am a TRUE pokemon fan and I will be a pokemon master someday.</p>\n<p>Hopefully it won&#8217;t take over 10 years like it has for Ash, but hey, to each their own!</p>\n<p>-Alice</p>\n", "post_id": 1084, "location": false, "date": "08-09-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["cosplay", "SyFy", "Heroes of Cosplay", "anime", "convention", "Yaya Han", "comic book"], "text": "<div id=\"attachment_1088\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/heroesofcosplay.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1088\" alt=\"Photo from legedarium.mymiddleearth.com\" src=\"https://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/heroesofcosplay.jpg?w=600&#038;h=337\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo from legedarium.mymiddleearth.com</p></div>\n<p>Hey everyone! Happy Trolling Tuesday!</p>\n<p>So any geek in this fandom knows what cosplaying is. They&#8217;ve either done it before or take pictures of people who do it. Cosplaying is not only just playing &#8220;dress up&#8221; to some&#8230; it really is a lifestyle. Whether people do it for fun, to network, or to really advance their career, cosplay is something that we geeks hold dear to ourselves.</p>\n<p>In case you were unaware, the SyFy network has a new show their premiering tonight called Heroes of Cosplay. It&#8217;s a reality show that features 9 talented cosplayers, all ranging in different levels of skill, and the process of how they make these amazing outfits and compete in them.</p>\n<p>The only cosplayer I know from the cast (not personally, but I wish!) is the legend herself, Yaya Han. If you don&#8217;t know who Yaya Han is, shame on you! To put it simply, she&#8217;s an amazing cosplayer with remarkable skill that has created her own career JUST cosplaying. She&#8217;s seriously living the Nerdy American dream.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/yayahanrt.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1089 aligncenter\" alt=\"YayaHanRT\" src=\"https://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/yayahanrt.jpg?w=516&#038;h=127\" width=\"516\" height=\"127\" /></a>Yeah, she retweeted me. I fangirled for about five minutes.</p>\n<p>Anyways, for some reason, there&#8217;s been a lot of controversy surrounding the show. Some fans think that the show will portray cosplaying in a bad light. If you&#8217;re one of those fans, please enlighten me, because I really don&#8217;t see any reason why they would.</p>\n<p>If fans are worried about the &#8220;drama&#8221; that&#8217;s on the show, well, isn&#8217;t that realistic? Especially if you&#8217;re competing?! When I was 12-years-old, my friends and I competed in a masquerade. We just did a skit, but nonetheless it was still a competition. The entire day before the masquerade began was hectic beyond belief. I was only a kid at the time so I didn&#8217;t really comprehend a lot of things, but looking back, I can honestly say I&#8217;m grateful for the experience and I commend ANYONE who does this. Because yeah&#8230; it is stressful as fuck.</p>\n<p>Overall, I am SUPER excited for the premiere tonight. It&#8217;s about time the mainstream media learns about what we do. I feel this show will be a great gateway for new fans to come into the community and even try cosplaying out.</p>\n<p>And isn&#8217;t that what it&#8217;s all about? Sharing our knowledge of the craft?</p>\n<p>-Alice</p>\n", "post_id": 1087, "location": false, "date": "08-13-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["judgement", "blogger problems", "personal", "blogger", "Youtube", "blog", "sword art online", "mmorpg"], "text": "<p>Hey everyone! Happy Wednesday!</p>\n<p>So I&#8217;m gonna be honest with all of you. I&#8217;ve been super lazy with drafting new blog posts lately. It&#8217;s just a combination of writer&#8217;s block and pure laziness. There&#8217;s really not much more to it. There&#8217;s nothing dramatic going on in my life, nor am I so busy that I don&#8217;t have the time to sit down and blog. I&#8217;ve just been feeling pretty lazy. And a tad bit uninspired.</p>\n<p>But I didn&#8217;t want to leave you guys hanging! I&#8217;m still here. I&#8217;m still derping and wreaking havoc on the internet. Therefore, I decided I should at least give you some updates about what I&#8217;ve been up to. (Obviously, blogging won&#8217;t be on this list. #FAILBLOG)</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1093\" style=\"width: 590px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/swordartonline-poster.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1093\" alt=\"Photo from varewulf.wordpress.com\" src=\"https://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/swordartonline-poster.jpg?w=580&#038;h=340\" width=\"580\" height=\"340\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo from varewulf.wordpress.com</p></div>\n<p>Before you say it, I know I&#8217;m late on this trend. BUT in my defense, I recently started watching more recent anime. I like to keep it old school for the most part, but I know if I wanna keep up at cons, I have to keep watching all the new shows. Which isn&#8217;t a bad thing because this show is ridiculously awesome.</p>\n<p>So for those unfortunate souls who don&#8217;t know this anime, it&#8217;s called Sword Art Online. To give a very brief summary of the series, it&#8217;s about the MMORPG titled Sword Art Online (it&#8217;s fictional) but instead of it being just any ol&#8217; regular game, players have to wear this headpiece called a NerveGear and their minds go into this entirely virtual world. Crazy, right?! The Japanese come up with everything!\u00a0The series follows two main characters, Kirito and Asuna. The reason why this anime is ridiculously awesome is because 1) the plot, 2) character development, and 3) the cosplay opportunities! I mean, the awesome character designs. Ahem.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m still on episode 15, but I already went ahead and read spoilers because I was so mindfucked with what happened that I needed to know what happened in order to keep my anxiety at ease. Seriously. No joke. If you&#8217;re into MMORPGs, you should definitely check this out. Or if you&#8217;re looking for a good story with fantasy elements, you should watch it.</p>\n<p>AND if you want a good love story&#8230; you should watch this series. Just sayin&#8217;. I ship Kirito and Asuna so hard, you don&#8217;t even KNOW! I can&#8217;t even tell you how many times my heart burst into butterflies every time they had a cute moment.</p>\n<p>To end my SOA rant, I&#8217;ll leave you with this piece of advice: just watch it, damnit. You won&#8217;t regret it. You can watch it on Crunchyroll, Hulu, OR Toonami. You have no excuse.</p>\n<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='560' height='315' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/8zYSbLL5Eo0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span>\n<p>In case you weren&#8217;t aware, I do indeed have my own Youtube channel. For a while, I only had 2 casual vlogs up (one about my Sailor Venus tattoo and the other was for my friend David&#8217;s birthday) but now I officially have a formal vlog up! And by formal vlog, I just mean, instead of walking around with a camera, I&#8217;m sitting in front of my laptop talking about issues that interest me. For all you bloggers out there, this one&#8217;s for you.</p>\n<p>Remember to &#8220;like&#8221; the video, subscribe, and please share it! Let&#8217;s help a sista out, yeah?! <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)</span></p>\n<p>And in addition to these two things, I&#8217;m of course just working and interning every week.

It&#8217;s been a while.</p>\n<p>Again, sorry for the break in between posts. But rest assured, I&#8217;m here and I&#8217;m ready to finally finish this damn Blog Challenge! I should technically be done by now, but oh well.</p>\n<p>This is a fun topic for me because I absolutely love the use of nicknames. I don&#8217;t know why, I&#8217;ve just always thought using real names is boring and too simple. Call me adventurous, but I just like having an &#8220;A.K.A.&#8221;</p>\n<p>So pretty much the only nickname I have is Ally. Growing up, my parents used to spell this like &#8220;Ali&#8221; but I HATED that spelling because it would make people pronounce it like &#8220;Ah-lee.&#8221; Like, Prince Ali, amorous he, Ali Ababwa. Yeah, I&#8217;m not Aladdin. And thumbs up if you just sang that lyric as you read it, hehe.</p>\n<p>I always spelled it like &#8220;Ally&#8221; because I just preferred the Y over an I, even though my name real name is spelled with an I. Confusing? Well get used to it. I&#8217;m pretty much convinced I was put on this earth to mindfck everyone, if not, make everyone uncomfortable. Is it working yet?</p>\n<p>So a fun fact about this nickname. Without even realizing it, I will ALWAYS use this name when I&#8217;m in some sort of broadcast or in front of an audience. When I was in high school, I used to be that annoying peppy girl (I still am&#8230; haha&#8230;) on the announcements and whenever I would sign off, I would say, &#8220;And this is Ally&#8230; saying have a great day!&#8221; I remember my friends would be like &#8220;Ally? You wanna be called that now?&#8221; And they had a legitimate reason to ask that because when I would introduce myself to people, I would always use my full name. I STILL DO THAT TIL THIS DAY! Just the other day at my internship, I was meeting some of the other interns for the first time and I introduced myself using my full name. But when I interview choreographers for the community class, I always say my name is Ally. I have no idea why I do this. It&#8217;s like some weird automatic reflex I have that I can&#8217;t really control because I just do it voluntarily. WEIRD.</p>\n<p>And I think I&#8217;ve spoken in great detail about where the name &#8220;Alice Vega&#8221; came from in multiple posts, so in case you still don&#8217;t know&#8230; just skim through all my blog posts. Sorry, brah. I&#8217;m making you WERK.</p>\n<p>Yes, that was an intentional spelling of WERK. You have to say it while snapping your fingers.

This is awkward writing to someone I don&#8217;t know yet, but bear with me. I&#8217;m here to give you some heads up on what to expect when we&#8217;re hitched and ready to start our life together.</p>\n<p>And by the way, that wasn&#8217;t some weird sexual innuendo. By &#8220;heads up&#8221; I mean that I&#8217;m just giving you some advice. Pervert.</p>\n<p>I can be absolutely and utterly impulsive, which can be both good and bad. Once I decide to do something, I&#8217;m going to find a way to do it. Please be understanding and know that it&#8217;s nothing personal if I&#8217;m going to be away from you from periods of time. I&#8217;m just chasing dreams, no matter how old I am. I hope you will still be by my side and support me as I do.</p>\n<p>I can also be ridiculously stubborn in my ways. Yes, I hear your side of the story and understand your opinions, but that doesn&#8217;t mean I like them. And I&#8217;ll make sure you know I don&#8217;t like them. Please be patient with me on this one&#8230; I&#8217;m trying to get better at this.</p>\n<p>I hope you can put up with my love for the Geek Fandom. I love going to conventions and cosplaying. I love watching anime and blogging about how it makes me feel. I love dancing to Jpop and Kpop songs. I hope you like this too, otherwise our relationship can be pretty difficult to maintain.</p>\n<p>Oh and on the topic of Geek Culture, I hope you don&#8217;t mind my mass collection of manga and comic books. I like collecting these things and you better not fcking sell these on eBay if we&#8217;re ever in need of money. I don&#8217;t care HOW broke we might get&#8230; I&#8217;d rather sell our TV. We can always watch shows on our laptops&#8230; duh&#8230;</p>\n<p>I also have a Love-Hate relationship with food. Sometimes I&#8217;ll want to eat and pass out on the couch and sometimes I&#8217;ll be religiously counting my calories. Sorry in advanced. I know this behavior is so bipolar, but again, be patient with me. Just encourage me to workout with you and we&#8217;ll be good.</p>\n<p>Lastly, I like to dance. I hope you do too. Or this could get awkward. At least twerk or something. If you need help, there&#8217;s a bunch of tutorials on Youtube.</p>\n<p>BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, I promise to love and cherish you as long as you love and cherish me. May we find everlasting happiness together.</p>\n<p>Love,<br />\nAlly</p>\n", "post_id": 1105, "location": false, "date": "08-19-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["adulthood", "career", "positive thinking", "graduation", "job", "college", "senior", "adolescence"], "text": "<p>Hey everyone!

As for me, I see it as, &#8220;I can literally see the light at the end of the tunnel and I just want to get to the other side as fast as I fcking can.&#8221; This is my very last semester of college EVER, as I have no intention of pursuing any master&#8217;s degree. This is a bittersweet moment, but it&#8217;s a moment that I have waited a long ass time for. I am ready to be free from school.</p>\n<p>I always hear a lot of mixed reactions from alumni who are living the post graduate life. Most of the time, I hear the &#8220;IT SUCKS! I MISS COLLEGE!!&#8221; reaction. I&#8217;m not going to lie, those reactions make me a little sad to hear because this is the moment when we literally leave the nest forever. We&#8217;re no longer kids. We&#8217;re now equipped with our professional degrees and we can pursue anything we want. To me, that sounds like a rockstar dream. I&#8217;m no longer tied down to papers, exams, and all nighters. I can finally be who I want to be and live the life I&#8217;ve always dreamed of.</p>\n<p>Call me idealistic, but that&#8217;s just how I see it! And I just don&#8217;t understand why others can&#8217;t see it that way too. I feel like some people just fall into a rut after they graduate because they don&#8217;t find their career job right away. But why were you expecting to? Not to be a bitch, but stuff like that takes time. We gotta struggle a little until we find our dream job. And if you don&#8217;t know your dream job, then maybe that&#8217;s the the core issue you&#8217;re not addressing.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve always been one to follow my passions. I never want to settle for second best. I&#8217;ll be honest, I have gotten some job offers in the past couple months. Job offers that would pay me a lot more than my current part-time job pays me. But I turned them down. Why? Because it&#8217;s not going to contribute to my future plans in any way. It&#8217;s a quick fix&#8230; meaning I&#8217;d only be doing the job for the money RIGHT now. But in the long run, I don&#8217;t want to value that kind of money. I want to value the money that I worked my ass off for doing something that I absolutely love. Not something that was a quick fix kind of job.</p>\n<p>And I totally understand if you&#8217;re in a rut right now and trying to figure your life out. I&#8217;m in the same boat too, as with most seniors in college/recent grads. But the one thing I found solace in was knowing that I could pursue what I want to pursue and no one can tell me otherwise. I can start this blog, I can start a Youtube channel, and I can dance. Is it making me money? No, but it&#8217;s making me happy and as long as I&#8217;m happy, everything else will slowly fall into place. I&#8217;m a firm believer in positive thinking. If you do good things and constantly strive for good things, then good things are sure to come.</p>\n<p>But my number one advice is don&#8217;t feel ENTITLED for good things. First of all, I hate people like that. You weren&#8217;t put on this earth to be catered to, mtherfcker, so you better be working hard like everyone else here. Like I said, struggle a little for now and eventually your dream job will find its way into your life. Just stay positive and remember some company out there wants YOU and your talent. They just haven&#8217;t met you yet.</p>\n<p>-Alice</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "post_id": 1108, "location": false, "date": "08-19-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["geek girl", "30 day blogging challenge", "blogger", "30 day challenge", "anime", "youtuber", "vlogger", "baby panda"], "text": "<p>Hey friends!

Ok, now YOU caption that picture. Leave a comment and let me know what you think the Baby Panda is thinking.</p>\n<p>Moving on, Day 22&#8217;s challenge is &#8220;What Makes You Different.&#8221; Well&#8230; I feel a lot of things make me stand out from the crowd and I&#8217;ve gotten to a point in my life where I&#8217;m proud of it. Like most geeks, I used to be ashamed and lonely. But now I&#8217;ve just totally embraced who I am and ya know what? It feels pretty damn good.</p>\n<p>What makes me different is my spontaneous and super driven personality. If I want something, I will go to great lengths to make it happen. I used to intern all the way in Santa Monica, CA. Now I won&#8217;t tell you where exactly in SoCal I live, but let&#8217;s just say this drive on a GOOD day took about 2 hours. I was youngER and didn&#8217;t exactly think about how far Santa Monica was from me. But lesson learned. And it made me realize that I do indeed love the LA life and I want to move out there someday.</p>\n<p>And right now my internship is in Torrance. So&#8230; I think you guys got the point that I will pretty much drive out to LA to work or intern at. Hey, if you want something, you just gotta go balls out and GO FOR IT. Life&#8217;s not gonna wait for you to make a choice.</p>\n<p>Another thing that makes me different is how passionate I can be about the things I like. If I like something, I. LIKE. IT. I&#8217;m the kind of girl that will go above and beyond and try to find out everything I can about it. For instance, if I&#8217;m obsessed with a certain anime, I&#8217;ll want to cosplay from it, find all the blogs dedicated to it, read fanfiction, download the soundtrack, etc. With all of my favorite Youtubers, I follow their Twitters, Instagrams, and Facebooks just to stay connected with them because I feel like we can be friends someday. (God, that sounded so sad and creepy. The story of the lonely fangirl. Lulz.)\u00a0</p>\n<p>And the last thing that makes me different from others is my personality. Yes, I&#8217;m loud. Yes, I laugh loud. And yes, I can be utterly ridiculous most, if not all the time. I&#8217;m just a huge dork and I like to have fun. Being serious and quiet was just never my strong suit. That&#8217;s why I can never play poker. I have no poker face. Unless I&#8217;m singing to Lady Gaga. P-p-p-poker face, my-my poker face.\u00a0</p>\n<p>On a side note, I just uploaded a new video onto my Youtube channel so check that out please! I pretty much pulled an all nighter to get this out to you guys by today, so watch it! It&#8217;s good. I think. I may or may not be twerking. Just sayin&#8217;. If you wanna know for sure, you gotta go watch. And subscribe. And like.\u00a0</p>\n<p>OK?! Cool.

Happy Wednesday!</span></p>\n<p>So I&#8217;ve been wanting to chime in on this topic for a very long time now, but I&#8217;ve just been waiting until the right moment. The reason I think this moment is the right one is because of what&#8217;s currently happening in our community right now. As some of you may or may not know, the SyFy reality show Heroes of Cosplay is turning our community into utter chaos. How this show is relevant to this topic&#8230; well, just stick with me.</p>\n<p>First off, a Fake Geek Girl is defined as a female of any age faking it in the geek culture, i.e. cosplaying characters she doesn&#8217;t know, saying she&#8217;s a gamer but has never touched a Playstation, etc. You might have seen some of these girls or know some yourself. But here&#8217;s a newsflash: Who the fuck cares?</p>\n<p>A girl cosplaying for attention? Oh my gosh, who would do such a thing?! It&#8217;s not like anyone, male or female, dresses up in these costumes to get attention or anything! It&#8217;s not like your standing out from the crowd by wearing something different, right? Who cosplays for attention nowadays anyway?!</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re cosplaying, then you&#8217;re obviously trying to get noticed. I mean, THINK ABOUT IT. If you don&#8217;t want to get noticed, wouldn&#8217;t you wear clothing that doesn&#8217;t make you stand out? Let me break that down even more. If you&#8217;re trying to get noticed, you&#8217;re trying to get people&#8217;s attention. So by the transitive property that we all learned in high school, ANYONE cosplaying is trying to seek attention.</p>\n<p>And why is that a bad thing? People make that out to be a terrible, vain factor of cosplay. If you poured blood, sweat, and tears into your costume as well as months and months of paychecks, you totally deserve to show that shit off and get recognition for your hard work. Cosplaying for attention isn&#8217;t a bad thing. It&#8217;s actually the norm. So get that out of your head that we females are doing this to get attention.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re thinking more in terms with the fact that females who wear revealing outfits are trying to get attention, then so be it! Maybe they are, maybe they&#8217;re not. Again, who the fuck cares? Is it ruining your life? Is it deterring your will to live? No, so stop making it a big deal. If they&#8217;re confident in themselves to model a sexy cosplay, then let them do it! If you&#8217;re more on the conservative side and don&#8217;t really like sexy cosplay, then don&#8217;t do sexy cosplay. There&#8217;s no rule book on how to cosplay. Photographers are going to flock to sexy cosplays whether you like it or not. This is how the world works, unfortunately, but don&#8217;t let that get you down. Don&#8217;t let other people&#8217;s opinions morph your view of yourself. Strut your stuff, and be proud of whoever you&#8217;re cosplaying as.</p>\n<p>So let me state the obvious here: most of the content creators in our geek culture, i.e. comic book writers, artists, manga artists, etc, are STILL mostly men. Therefore, they will most of the time have a patriarchal perspective on most things. If you&#8217;re wondering why most female super heroes are dressed that way, that wasn&#8217;t a coincidence.</p>\n<p>But hello, welcome to the year 2013. Females like this shit too. I know, crazy, right? Females like anime, video games, and comic books. Some females are aspiring directors and filmmakers. Some females want to make their own comic books. If you&#8217;re sitting here reading this like this is a new concept, then again, welcome to the year 2013. Sorry your distant planet didn&#8217;t have concepts like this.</p>\n<p>This is no longer a Boys Only club, and it never should have been. There&#8217;s plenty of strong females who are content creators and it&#8217;s only a matter of time before their work can be seen by millions of people. Call me idealistic, but I have faith.</p>\n<p>So let&#8217;s stop feeding this outdated idea to young girls that they have to grow up and be a secretary and like Barbie. If they want to be a secretary and like Barbie, that&#8217;s totally cool! But if they aspire to be the President and like Iron Man, then that&#8217;s pretty damn cool too.</p>\n<p>And the next time you see a girl &#8220;faking&#8221; it, just remember, we all had to start somewhere. You didn&#8217;t come into this culture being a fcking expert at Call of Duty. Let these new fans explore their interests and don&#8217;t be an asshole about it.</p>\n<p>And how does this tie into the current Cosplay crisis? Well, a lot of fans are upset at how the show is portraying cosplayers. Apparently, the show is showcasing a very catty, egotistical, dog-eat-dog world of cosplay. While I agree with these fans that this is an inaccurate portrayal of the cosplay world, I&#8217;d also like to remind everyone that this is TELEVISION. Hi, Welcome to the year 2013 again. TV is fake and sometimes scripted. Oh my gosh, no way!! You mean the Bachelorette doesn&#8217;t really find true love at the end?!?</p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height:1.5;\">The producers of the show are going to edit the B-Roll as they see fit. What makes it into the show is whatever makes it into the show. A TV show or movie or any sort of film is STORYTELLING at the very core. You need a plot, you need characters, and you need a conflict. Otherwise you might as well show a live stream of a convention. And as we all know, that&#8217;s definitely not gonna get any TV show good ratings.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height:1.5;\">To me, it&#8217;s also an issue of new fans vs. old fans. Also known as elitists vs. noobs. Now these people who don&#8217;t know what the hell anime or comic books are are gonna start cosplaying and acting like they know shit. Raise your hand if you heard this argument before.</span></p>\n<p>Let me repeat myself. Let these new fans explore their new interests. If a new fan discovers cosplay through this show, that&#8217;s great. Share your craft. And see this as an opportunity to be someone&#8217;s senpai.</p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height:1.5;\">So fellow Internet friends, what have we learned today? I hope you&#8217;ve taken something away from this, and that I&#8217;ve challenged you to think a little differently.\u00a0</span><span style=\"line-height:1.5;\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"line-height:1.5;\"><br />\nLeave a comment and let them feels out.</span></p>\n<p>-Alice</p>\n", "post_id": 1116, "location": false, "date": "08-21-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["body image", "positive body image", "cosplay", "positive thinking", "geek culture", "geek", "Heroes of Cosplay", "healthy lifestyle", "working out"], "text": "<div id=\"attachment_1127\" style=\"width: 585px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/bmi-body-weight.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1127\" alt=\"Photo from livescience.com\" src=\"https://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/bmi-body-weight.jpg?w=575&#038;h=380\" width=\"575\" height=\"380\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo from livescience.com</p></div>\n<p>Hey everyone! Happy Monday!</p>\n<p>So to keep this momentum going from my last post about Fake Geek Girls and the Heroes of Cosplay controversy, I want to address another issue that the show has brought up: body image.</p>\n<p>So in the show, Becky discusses her insecurity about gaining weight. Her issue in the last episode was about looking and feeling confident in her Merida (from Disney&#8217;s Brave) cosplay. This issue is so relevant in the geek and cosplay community because as fellow geeks, most of our hobbies, such as playing video games, reading comic books, watching anime, etc. doesn&#8217;t really require us to be super active. Therefore, we tend to be less in shape. (And just as a disclaimer: This isn&#8217;t a scientific fact so don&#8217;t quote me on this. This is just from my experience as a fellow geek.) Now that cosplay is such a huge part of the geek fandom, it presents this oxymoron of the sorts. You spend all your time playing a video game (not being active or exercising) and then you want to cosplay a character with a tiny waist, perky boobs, and a nice ass. Well, that&#8217;s lovely and all but you just finished an entire box of Hot Pockets. Having six-pack abs definitely wasn&#8217;t on your mind as you were finishing the game.</p>\n<p>Let me just put it out there that I DEFINITELY know these feels. I have always and currently struggle with body image issues because I dance. And dancer bodies are HOT! It can be such a struggle to keep up with the masses. Not to mention the amount of pressure and stress it can be on a person to have to look a certain way in order for society to deem as acceptable and successful. The internet can be a very scary place. People are ruthless behind their keyboards and they won&#8217;t hesitate to point out your stretch marks or love handles in your latest cosplay pic.</p>\n<p>But I&#8217;m here to tell you to face your insecurities head on. Don&#8217;t run away from the problem or just be depressed about it. First of all, be PROUD of your body type. I&#8217;m slowly learning to love my curves and I find myself becoming more confident when taking pictures. I know it can be such a &#8220;foreign&#8221; concept, but we all have different body types! Say what?! You mean, we&#8217;re not all supposed to be those stick skinny girls on the magazine covers?!</p>\n<p>NO! And don&#8217;t give into that crap. Love your body and love where you came from. That&#8217;s step 1. Step 2, if you do find yourself wanting to change something, then go do it! Do it at your own pace. If you haven&#8217;t worked out in 10 years, don&#8217;t jump into P90x today. Be realistic and set some realistic goals for yourself. Even if it&#8217;s once or twice a week, just take a walk in the park. As long as you&#8217;re moving, you&#8217;re being active and you&#8217;re working those muscles.</p>\n<p>And on the other side of that spectrum, if you have a thin body type, don&#8217;t worry! There&#8217;s always room to bulk up and get that nice, toned booty! People tend to shun naturally thin girls and tell them they have it easy because society deems thin as acceptable. But on the contrary, thin girls can feel just as insecure. It doesn&#8217;t matter what body type you are, advertising companies are gonna drill this idea in your head that YOU will never be good enough. And don&#8217;t let them. You&#8217;re better than that.</p>\n<p>And I didn&#8217;t forget my handsome fellas reading this! Don&#8217;t get caught up in the whole &#8220;bulking up, protein shakes all day everyday&#8221; culture. If you genuinely enjoy that lifestyle, then by all means, go do it! But just because your friends are all doing it doesn&#8217;t mean you have to as well. Same idea here: love and accept your body. Then if you want to make some changes, then go make some changes. Even if it&#8217;s just pledging to cut down on junk food or just doing some simple at home conditioning &#8211; every step counts. Do it at your own pace. You owe yourself that.</p>\n<p>Cosplay can be this amazing motivational tool to help you get into shape. But don&#8217;t just strive to have Psylocke&#8217;s body or Wolverine&#8217;s biceps. Strive to have YOUR best body. Work out because you want to be a better you. Not just to look like a certain character. Trust me, you&#8217;ll feel a whole lot happier in the long run.</p>\n<p>Body image will sadly always be an ongoing issue in our culture, but we can&#8217;t succumb to those negative thoughts. Positive energy is contagious and I encourage you to own it and spread that shit all over!</p>\n<p>&#8230; That sounded weird and awkward. But you get my point. I hope.</p>\n<p>&#8216;Til next time, my loves.</p>\n<p>-Alice</p>\n", "post_id": 1126, "location": false, "date": "08-27-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["dance", "advice", "dance life", "dancer", "inspirational", "Boogiezone"], "text": "<p>Hey everyone!! Happy Wednesday!</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve last seen you! But that was entirely my fault. I went into hustle mode and I didn&#8217;t exactly have time to sit down and blog about it. But what&#8217;s done is done and here I am! Sorry I neglected you, my internet friends. I missed you and I definitely didn&#8217;t forget about you.</p>\n<p>So in case you don&#8217;t know, I actually have interests outside of my Geek Girl persona. (SAY WHAAT?!) I know, right? Who does that? Well, actually, a lot of people do. And I say it&#8217;s time we start acknowledging that it&#8217;s NORMAL to be a well rounded person.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve said it multiple times in this blog, but I&#8217;ll say it again. I love to dance. I started dancing when I was 12-years-old. My dad was a ballroom dance instructor and he put my sister and I in classes. We took the generic studio classes &#8211; ballet, jazz, tap, hip hop. At first I was trying to rebel against the dance life because most of my family did it and I wanted to be different. But in jr. high when I joined the dance team, I realized dance was a passion of mine.</p>\n<p>I continued to dance all throughout high school and during my freshman year of college. But after that, I stopped. It was sad. Life got in the way and I couldn&#8217;t find time to take class anymore. Plus, the SoCal dance scene was absolute craziness. It was this whole world I&#8217;ve never seen and it was intimidating as fck. These hip hop dancers were incredible to watch and I just felt like I wasn&#8217;t good enough to train with them. I also felt insignificant because I never danced on a team before. I was just that lone, solo dancer that watched from afar&#8230; hoping and wishing someday that can be me&#8230;</p>\n<p>Okay. I&#8217;m totally exaggerating. But my point is I then began to admire the dance community from a distance rather than be in it.</p>\n<p>That all changed about 2 months ago when I applied to be a staff for Boogiezone.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1135\" style=\"width: 490px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/bzu5_4.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1135\" alt=\"Interviewing Ellen Kim from Movement Lifestyle\" src=\"https://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/bzu5_4.jpg?w=480&#038;h=480\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Interviewing Ellen Kim from Movement Lifestyle</p></div>\n<p>Boogiezone is this wonderful dance community that bridges the industry and community together to train under one roof. Not only does it provide a healthy environment to learn in, it provides numerous opportunities to grow and challenge yourself.</p>\n<p>I got an email that they were hiring staff for different locations and I decided, why the hell not. I was looking for an internship and this felt like the right one. To my surprise, I got an email from the brainchild himself, Elm, a day later asking for a phone interview. And it&#8217;s all history from there&#8230;</p>\n<p>Erm.. well&#8230; 2 months of history. Whatever, don&#8217;t judge me.</p>\n<p>This experience so far has been amazing. I can&#8217;t even find the words to describe how confident I feel again. This past weekend was our summer intensive, Boogiezone University. It was 3 days of hard fcking WORK! We had classes all day and as staff, it was our job to pump up the classes and make sure the choreographer&#8217;s and students&#8217; experience was one they wouldn&#8217;t forget.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1136\" style=\"width: 490px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/bzu5_5.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1136\" alt=\"Anthony Lee, Culture Shock LA Director\" src=\"https://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/bzu5_5.jpg?w=480&#038;h=480\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Anthony Lee, Culture Shock LA Director</p></div>\n<p>My primary job all weekend was to interview the choreographers. Now, I&#8217;m no stranger to interviewing. We do it every week for community class. But we had about 50 instructors altogether. I did about 85% of those interviews. I suck at math, but you can pretty much get the idea that I conducted a bunch of interviews back to back.</p>\n<p>It was hard, but I felt like I finally mattered.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1137\" style=\"width: 490px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/moon_iamme.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1137\" alt=\"Di Moon Zhang from I.aM.Me, ABDC's Season 6 Champions\" src=\"https://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/moon_iamme.jpg?w=480&#038;h=480\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Di Moon Zhang from I.aM.Me, ABDC&#8217;s Season 6 Champions</p></div>\n<p>Does that make sense? Sit tight, I&#8217;m about to get all philosophical up in here.</p>\n<p>For the past year, I was in a rut. I felt like a failure, I felt like I couldn&#8217;t make anyone happy or proud, I felt like I had nobody by my side and it was terrible. I felt like no matter what I did, it was and will always be wrong.</p>\n<p>Now I know what you&#8217;re thinking. This mentality is whack. First of all&#8230; hell yeah it is! Second of all, I went through this rut because of the people I was surrounded by. You know that saying that if you surround yourself with positive people who believe in you, you will always do well? Well it was exactly the opposite. I surrounded myself with people who doubted me and never believed that I could accomplish anything. I knew I had to take a stand and make a change if I wanted to be happy again.</p>\n<p>Now this is gonna get super corny but Boogiezone is the reason I&#8217;m back on my feet. There&#8217;s other factors too, but Boogiezone is a big factor. Just so you know, I entered this journey alone but I met so many wonderful people that I can consider dear friends of mine. I never would have imagined myself interviewing some of my favorite choreographers, let alone meeting them or taking their class. I am so incredibly grateful and blessed to have been able to do this. Seriously, thank you Elm for everything. Thank you for believing in me and thank you for allowing me to wreck havoc on your Youtube channel. Shit&#8217;s about to get real loud up in here.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1133\" style=\"width: 490px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/bzu5_2.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1133\" alt=\"Arnel Calvario, Kaba Modern Founder\" src=\"https://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/bzu5_2.jpg?w=480&#038;h=480\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Arnel Calvario, Kaba Modern Founder</p></div>\n<p>I could go on and on about what Boogiezone means to me, but I&#8217;ll tie it back to one of my many &#8220;Awesome Advice&#8221; posts. If you&#8217;re unhappy, DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. Please. We only have so much time to live on this earth. We can&#8217;t be wasting days just feeling sorry for ourselves. If you&#8217;re in a shitty job, if you&#8217;re in a shitty relationship, if you have shitty friends, make that change and make the choice to be happy today. There will always be outside factors you can&#8217;t control, but YOU have the power to change everything. You have the power to change your attitude. You have the power to change your life.</p>\n<p>So do it. I encourage you. You&#8217;ll be so much happier, I promise.</p>\n<p>I titled this post &#8220;Finding Yourself All Over Again&#8221; because I felt like I lost myself when I was in that rut. My daily routine was all mechanic and I was just going through the motions. I lost my purpose. But I found it again and I couldn&#8217;t be happier.</p>\n<p>And I&#8217;m just happy that people like Ellen Kim or Arnel Calvario noticed that. I really must be doing something good in my life!</p>\n<p>So let&#8217;s all find our purpose again. Let&#8217;s find ourselves through this hot mess we call life.</p>\n<p>-Ally</p>\n", "post_id": 1130, "location": false, "date": "09-05-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["geek girl", "mainstream", "advice", "elitists", "hipster", "underground"], "text": "<p>Hey everyone!

And then spew knowledge at them so they know not to be ignorant assholes.</p>\n<p>How&#8217;s that for an introduction? You know what I&#8217;m talking about. I&#8217;m talking about ELITISTS. What&#8217;s an elitist, you ask? Well let me give you my definition. An elitist is someone who acts elite. Simple, right? These are the people who act like they&#8217;re entitled to be the &#8220;VIP&#8221; section of their fandom. So if you&#8217;re a comic book fan, these are the people who own &#8220;X&#8221; amount of comics and scoff at newcomers who try to get into the series. These are the people who hear a song on the radio and say &#8220;Oh my gosh&#8230; this song was WAY cooler 6 months ago. Now it&#8217;s so mainstream. I hate this song now.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The other day on my Facebook feed, I saw a status from an acquaintance of mine who basically said that she&#8217;s over going to raves or massives because of all the stupid people who keep overdosing on drugs. She said she doesn&#8217;t like these events anymore because it went &#8220;mainstream&#8221; and all these other n00bs (newbies) destroyed something that used to be so &#8220;underground.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Okay&#8230; I&#8217;ll let that sink in for a minute.</p>\n<p>First of all, raves/massives weren&#8217;t YOURS to begin with so why are you complaining all these people destroyed it? Here&#8217;s a newsflash for everyone reading this: there&#8217;s stupid people EVERYWHERE. In ALL parts of the world. You can&#8217;t hide from them! They&#8217;re going to be in your fandom or hobby.</p>\n<p>Oh noes. What do we dooooo?!</p>\n<p>How about you IGNORE them? Does it really bother you THAT much that they&#8217;re trying to get into something you&#8217;re into? I&#8217;m not gonna lie&#8230; there are some anime fans that seriously make me shake my head when I see them. Am I gonna fall to the ground and die because their existence is ruining my love for anime? NO. I&#8217;m still here. I&#8217;m still allowed to love anime. End of story. Ignore them! Who says you need to be their friend?</p>\n<p>I know that can sound pretty mean, but seriously! We&#8217;re all adults here! We&#8217;re not in elementary school where you have to send an obligatory Valentine&#8217;s Day card to everyone in your classroom. If you don&#8217;t want to be associated with someone, then don&#8217;t associate yourself with them. This isn&#8217;t fcking rocket science.</p>\n<p>And I know someone&#8217;s going to bring up the whole argument of &#8220;Ermagerrdd&#8230; their behavior is making ALL of us look bad.&#8221; Ok well let me refute that by saying WHAT KIND OF GROUP/ORGANIZATION DOESN&#8217;T HAVE SOMEONE LIKE THAT? It takes ONE bad apple to ruin the bunch but that doesn&#8217;t mean \u00a0you have to automatically identify yourself with them. Whatever happened to just doing your own thing? Whatever happened to just telling people you&#8217;re proud to be unique and an individual? Just because there&#8217;s anime fans that are a bit immature, doesn&#8217;t mean I should be ashamed of myself. There&#8217;s always going to be stereotypes. There&#8217;s always going to be people who believe in those stereotypes. If someone doesn&#8217;t want to get to know you because they automatically judge you for being that raver or anime fan, then fck them! They were probably going to be a shitty friend anyway!</p>\n<p>YOU DON&#8217;T NEED EVERYONE&#8217;S APPROVAL IN SOCIETY TO BE HAPPY. People are going to judge. Let them. They&#8217;re the ones missing out on a fabulous person.</p>\n<p>So I hope this has encouraged you to verbally slap the shit out of elitists. They annoy me oh so much. Can you tell?</p>\n<p>Get off your high horse, elitist. You&#8217;re not impressing anyone here.</p>\n<p>-Ally</p>\n", "post_id": 1140, "location": false, "date": "09-07-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p><a style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:12px;line-height:18px;text-align:center;\" href=\"http://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/smh-62789853090.jpeg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1152 alignnone\" alt=\"Photo from sodahead.com\" src=\"https://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/smh-62789853090.jpeg?w=640&#038;h=480\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a></p>\n<dl class=\"wp-caption  aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_1152\" style=\"width:650px;\">\n<dd class=\"wp-caption-dd\">Photo from sodahead.com</dd>\n</dl>\n<p><span style=\"line-height:1.5;\">Hey everyone!</p>\n<p>Just wanted to start off by apologizing yet again for the random hiatus.

I won&#8217;t go into detail because it&#8217;s not my story to tell, but in a nutshell, boys are stupid. Not all boys, but all boys. I don&#8217;t know what it is sometimes. Maybe it&#8217;s something in their genetic make up that doesn&#8217;t allow them to fully comprehend their actions or something. Whatever it is, please do us all a favor. Stop being stupid.</p>\n<p>Which leads me to the whole point in this post &#8211; sometimes people just SUCK! I don&#8217;t know why people just do stupid shit that they don&#8217;t fully think about and then get all surprised that people are hurt by their actions. Frankly, it pisses me off because that just means you really have no regard to my feelings whatsoever if you&#8217;re gonna do stupid shit and not even THINK about how it&#8217;s going to affect me.</p>\n<p>And you might be thinking: why does it matter? Well if we&#8217;re good friends, OF COURSE it&#8217;s going to matter what the hell you&#8217;re doing with your life! If I care about you, I want you to succeed and be happy. If I see you making choices that don&#8217;t lead you down that path, of course I&#8217;m going to be concerned. Of course I&#8217;m going to intercept with whatever fuckery you&#8217;re planning and get you to think twice about what you&#8217;re about to do. It&#8217;s called&#8230; umm&#8230; OH YEAH. FRIENDSHIP.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m going to be brutally honest here. (Aren&#8217;t I always?) There&#8217;s a couple blog posts of mine that have implied that the people I hung around in the past treated me poorly. Whether they&#8217;re reading this or not never affected how I wrote about it. I don&#8217;t care if they&#8217;re reading this. This is my blog, this is my space, and you can&#8217;t tell me what I can and can&#8217;t express on here. It&#8217;s like when you&#8217;re the passenger in someone&#8217;s car and the owner of the car listens to some weird shit you don&#8217;t like on the radio. Well, I&#8217;m sorry but the owner of the car gets to make the rules in their car. You&#8217;re stuck listening to their weird shit. If you don&#8217;t like it, drive yourself around, buddy.</p>\n<p>What makes me even more mad is when people don&#8217;t even REALIZE their actions or words are hurting someone. Like, are you SERIOUS right now?! You&#8217;re just going to mouth off and not give a single FUCK on whatever repercussions come your way? Wow. I mean, good luck going through life. Don&#8217;t be surprised when no one&#8217;s commenting on your million Facebook statuses that talk about how you&#8217;re &#8220;SOO&#8221; happy to be single and your million selfies on your Instagram with a million hashtags of &#8220;#likeforlike, #IGDaily, and #ootd.&#8221; Newsflash: no one CARES.</p>\n<p>I am a firm believer in karma. If you put good energy into this world, you will receive good energy back. If you put bad energy into this world, then you better hide yo kids, hide yo wife, because karma is coming after yo ass. Remember that golden rule&#8230; treat others how you want to be treated? I mean if you like being treated like you&#8217;re worth nothing in this world and you like being told your intelligence level is equal to that chair you&#8217;re sitting on then SURE! Keep on being a dick to people. But if you like when people praise you for your hard work and recognize the passion you have for life, then GIVE OTHERS THAT SAME RESPECT! I mean, is it really that hard to comprehend? Just because I&#8217;m not doing things YOUR way, doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s the wrong way. You have your life and I have mine. You can fck yours up all you want, but don&#8217;t get in the way of my happiness and the people&#8217;s happiness around me.</p>\n<p>Earlier today I tweeted, &#8220;I don&#8217;t remember you being this bitchy.&#8221; That tweet was geared towards an acquaintance I recently saw at an event and this person didn&#8217;t even acknowledge my presence. Didn&#8217;t even say hi, didn&#8217;t do ANYTHING to indicate that she saw me there. Now I know I&#8217;m not going to be everyone&#8217;s best friend but from one female to another, can you just PLEASE be civil? I mean, get that stick out of your ass. I don&#8217;t care if your the Queen of England, you better be cordial and act like a decent human being to me. If that&#8217;s too much to ask, well, I guess that was the extent of our so called friendship.</p>\n<p>So what did we learn today, friends? There&#8217;s always going to be people in our lives that screw us over. There&#8217;s going to be people that take you for granted and take advantage of the wonderful person that you are. Our job as GOOD people in this world is to handle people like this with class. I mean, that&#8217;s all we can do for them. After all, they&#8217;re doomed.</p>\n<p>#SorryNotSorry</p>\n<p>-Ally</span></p>\n", "post_id": 1151, "location": false, "date": "09-11-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["self realization", "advice", "life", "journey", "KevJumba", "kindness", "Inspiration"], "text": "<div id=\"attachment_1156\" style=\"width: 471px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\" wp-image-1156 \" alt=\"AllyVegaphotoshoot_black\" src=\"https://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/allyvegaphotoshoot_black.jpg?w=461&#038;h=690\" width=\"461\" height=\"690\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">This is my &#8220;inspired&#8221; face.</p></div>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Hey everyone! Happy Thursday!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">You know, one of the best feelings you can ever experience is the positive energy of being inspired by others. Lately in my life, I&#8217;ve been surrounded by such amazing, talented people who are motivated to pursue their dreams. They&#8217;re tenacious and will work hard because they understand that nothing great comes easy. I&#8217;ve always considered myself to have the same mentality and it&#8217;s just so refreshing to share that passion with others.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve read most or some of my blog posts, you&#8217;ll know that I&#8217;m a huge advocate for positive reinforcement. I think everyone always deserves some critique on how to better themselves, but in the end, I think the cherry on top is the &#8220;You&#8217;ve got this!&#8221; or &#8220;I believe in you!&#8221; statements that most of us forget to give to others. We can be so wrapped up in ourselves and how WE can improve, but we forget that there&#8217;s others along the way who are also in that same journey. We should be helping each other along. Because ultimately, who wants to stand at the top by themselves? What&#8217;s success if you don&#8217;t have others to share it with?</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not gonna lie, there are some people that you can&#8217;t help sometimes. These are the people who just have to learn it the hard way. You can&#8217;t just give them the answers and expect them to progress. Self realization is the only way people will grow. Sometimes people just gotta hit rock bottom to realize they have two options: they either continue on their downwards spiral or they wake the fuck up and make the change to better themselves.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not a perfect person and I never, ever claim to be one. I have a lot of stubborn tendencies and I can randomly be shy and awkward. But one thing&#8217;s for sure: I know what I want and I will work hard to get it. If that means I have to make some drastic changes and sacrifices, then I will. If that means there are people who I will lose touch with along the way, then so be it. It&#8217;s a sad thought, but the people who truly matter in your life will always be a part of your life journey, somehow and someway. Just because we lose touch, doesn&#8217;t mean I don&#8217;t appreciate what they&#8217;ve given to me. I treasure every connection and friend I&#8217;ve ever made.</p>\n<p>One last thought to leave you with before I conclude my rant for the day &#8211; be NICE to people. Please. Unless they&#8217;re just a dick.</p>\n<p>Ok but in all seriousness, being a genuinely nice person to everyone you meet goes a long way. You might not understand it in the moment, but just giving someone a smile and saying hello to them might have made their whole day. You don&#8217;t know what everyone is going through. You don&#8217;t know if they&#8217;re struggling. So&#8230; just be nice.</p>\n<p>And to everyone who&#8217;s just an asshole to everyone&#8230; you&#8217;re doomed. <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-tongue' title=':P'>:P</span> Remember what I said in my last post?! Karma&#8230;.

But brace yourself, I&#8217;m about to discuss a whole lot more than what meets the eye. You see, I&#8217;ve always wanted to do a beauty pageant themed post, but I never had a reason to. Well thank god it was pageant season, eh?!</p>\n<p>First off let me just say I&#8217;m pretty conflicted about all this. I&#8217;ll start off with why I&#8217;m happy. I&#8217;m very, very proud that the top 2 contestants for this year&#8217;s Miss America were of Asian-American descent. As a proud Asian-American, I&#8217;m absolutely proud of these two ladies for working hard and being recognized for their hard work. Just so you know, this is the first time someone of Indian descent has won the Miss America title. FIRST TIME, EVER! I mean, yes I&#8217;m proud, but dear god, why is this the first time? We&#8217;re in the year 2013 and we haven&#8217;t had an Indian winner? Kinda makes you think twice about our country really being as progressive as we think. Just because we have an African-American president, doesn&#8217;t mean we&#8217;re progressive as a nation. I will admit we are headed in the right direction, but there&#8217;s A LOT that we still need to work on.</p>\n<p>Second, I&#8217;d like to say that I&#8217;m very pleased that an Asian-American woman represented California. California is usually known for it&#8217;s &#8220;surfer&#8221; kinda girls with fake tans, beach blonde hair, and blue eyes, but that&#8217;s so not an accurate representation of ALL California girls. California as a state is SUPER diverse, especially the Southern California region. We don&#8217;t all look like that. There&#8217;s always been a pretty good Asian population throughout California, so I&#8217;m glad Miss Crystal Lee can represent that.</p>\n<p>Third, in general, I&#8217;m just proud that Miss America is slowly becoming a different look each year. I mean, I get that this isn&#8217;t the first time a white girl hasn&#8217;t won, and that&#8217;s not the point I&#8217;m trying to make. The point I&#8217;m making is that there are A LOT of different ethnicity in this country. Miss America should be an accurate representation of an American woman.</p>\n<p>Which brings me to my next point &#8211; the opposite side of this whole premise I&#8217;ve made so far. FYI, I&#8217;m about to get real critical up in here.</p>\n<p>I hate the idea of beauty pageants. They&#8217;re just so outdated and it just PROVES we reside in this ridiculously apparent patriarchal society that needs to go the fuck away. I mean, think about it: a COMPETITION about who&#8217;s the most ideal woman? To who&#8217;s standards? Not only do these women have to be a specific height and weight, they need to apparently be able to sound &#8220;smart&#8221; and have some random ass &#8220;showy&#8221; talent to display for others. And before anyone starts to sound off, I AM aware that the Miss America website doesn&#8217;t specify a specific height and weight, but I&#8217;m sorry, when was the last time you saw a plus sized woman win? Exactly.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m sorry, but EVERY and ANY woman can do this without it being shown on national television. Have you ever heard of a speech and debate competition? You can practice your public speaking skills there. And all the other categories? I mean, swimsuit competition?! Really?? How can you tell me that we&#8217;re a progressive nation if we&#8217;re seriously judging these young women on their bodies? THEIR BODIES! Jeez, why don&#8217;t you just put me in a cage and parade me around like an animal at a zoo?</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I&#8217;m not saying these women don&#8217;t work hard. I know they do. I know they are passionate about what they do. And that&#8217;s great. BUT, we can do that without competing against one another for a fucking crown. Any person, any size, shape, color, etc. can give back to their community. I think that&#8217;s great that all these women want to use their prize money on noble things, but can&#8217;t we obtain that money through other ways? Like, without having to strut in a bikini?</p>\n<p>The whole idea just baffles me. I believe all woman are intelligent, beautiful, and motivated in her own way. I just don&#8217;t like the idea that we need to place a label of &#8220;Miss _____&#8221; to prove she&#8217;s the best. Because frankly, she&#8217;s NOT. No one should put a scale on how much you give back to the community and how passionate you are about education and the future. You can do all that shit without investing thousands and thousands of dollars on a fucking ball gown and beauty pageant lessons.</p>\n<p>So, now you see the disparity in my feelings for beauty pageants, particularly this year&#8217;s Miss America competition. I really do sincerely congratulate Miss Nina Davuluri on her success, but I just think we need to start teaching our young girls that looks aren&#8217;t everything. Looks are subjective and we don&#8217;t need to be striving to be some sort of &#8220;ideal woman.&#8221; Fuck that shit. I am not a stick skinny girl and I&#8217;m very short, but I&#8217;m proud of my body, I&#8217;m proud that I can engage in political discussion, and I&#8217;m proud I can DANCE! I don&#8217;t need to compete in a beauty pageant to realize my potential as a well rounded woman.</p>\n<p>-Ally</p>\n", "post_id": 1161, "location": false, "date": "09-16-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["racists", "asian american", "racism", "indian", "asian", "miss america", "america", "white privilege"], "text": "<p>Hey everyone!</p>\n<p>So in the recent months, the subject of race and ethnicity have been a hot topic in politics and pop culture.

Here are a couple from the article so you can get an idea of what kind of feedback they gave:</p>\n<p>1) &#8220;How the fuck does a foreigner win Miss America? She is a Arab! #idiots&#8221;<br />\n-Jake Amick (@Jackamick5)</p>\n<p>2) &#8220;Miss America? You mean Miss 7-11&#8243;<br />\n-CHEEZ-IT (@JPLman95)</p>\n<p>3) &#8220;Don&#8217;t you have to be American to win Miss AMERICA? This bitch is some type of Indian.&#8221;<br />\n-Emily (@emi_adkins)<br />\nSoo.. let&#8217;s let that sink in for a minute.</p>\n<p>The ignorance, stupidity, and maliciousness that consume most of this country just baffles me. I don&#8217;t even know where to start with this one. I guess I&#8217;ll start with the most obvious one: geography.</p>\n<p>Remember in grade school when you were forced to look at a map of the world? And your teacher taught you that all those colorful pieces of land are called continents and within each continent there are different countries? If you weren&#8217;t taught this, then I guess I can understand why you&#8217;re a fucking idiot. This, my friends, is called the WORLD. The world is made up of many different places. There are countries and within these countries are PEOPLE. Depending on what country you&#8217;re in, there are different dialects and customs. It&#8217;s called.. um.. LIFE. Yeah. Go read about other people&#8217;s lives while you color in your geography worksheet. Remember, North and South America are two continents, k?</p>\n<p>It is BEYOND depressing that people who are racist can&#8217;t even distinguish who they&#8217;re racist about. Like, if you&#8217;re gonna hate on someone, at least KNOW who and what you&#8217;re hating on. Otherwise, you look like an uneducated idiot. Oh, too late for that. You fucked that up yourself.</p>\n<p>In case you don&#8217;t know the history of this country, let me give you a quick breakdown. English pilgrims came to this country to live and be free from a monarchy. They IMMIGRATED here. This land was already being inhabited by Native Americans. But because these bad ass pilgrims wanted to conquer the land, they drove the Native Americans out and took over. Cuz they&#8217;re bad ass and bad asses get what they want.</p>\n<p>So with that being said, WE&#8217;RE ALL IMMIGRANTS. So shut the fuck up with that nonsense about getting rid of illegal immigrants, as if you actually OWN America. Miss Nina Duvulari IS American. So are you, and so am I. Just because we don&#8217;t have white skin, blonde hair, and blue eyes, doesn&#8217;t mean we&#8217;re not American. If you were born here, raised here, believe in this country and do your part to be a good citizen, then you belong here.</p>\n<p>And don&#8217;t sound off about minorities like myself being racist to white people. Oh, jeez, don&#8217;t even go there. Minorities like myself who write about these kinds of controversies are just bringing light to the bullshit that&#8217;s happening before our eyes. There&#8217;s something called &#8220;White Privilege.&#8221; And if you&#8217;re white, you automatically have that. And don&#8217;t be all like, &#8220;Well it&#8217;s not my fault I was born white!&#8221;</p>\n<p>EXACTLY. Just like it&#8217;s not anyone&#8217;s fault that they&#8217;re homosexual or that they&#8217;re black. So for the last time, shut the fuck up with this nonsense.</p>\n<p>-Ally</p>\n", "post_id": 1168, "location": false, "date": "09-16-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["funny", "comedy", "awkward", "joke"], "text": "<p><span class=\"embed-vine\" style=\"display: block;\"><iframe class=\"vine-embed\" src=\"https://vine.co/v/hv2ertr1TT7/embed/simple\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>Hey everyone! Happy Saturday!</p>\n<p>Lately my posts have been pretty angry and political, so I wanted to bring back a little bit of my derpy side to lighten the mood. After all, I&#8217;m not ALWAYS angry. Just ya know&#8230; just almost always most of the time. (Wait, what?)</p>\n<p>So if you&#8217;ve kept up with my blog thus far, I think I&#8217;ve shown you guys just how weird and awkward I am. I try not to be, but I can&#8217;t help it when I find things funny and I make a joke and no one gets it. Then I&#8217;m THAT person just laughing by myself at something I thought would be hilarious to everyone. Damnit.</p>\n<p>So just TODAY ALONE, I had two extremely embarrassing events happen to me. When I was walking into work, this girl was walking towards me and she smiled and waved. When I see people smile, I can&#8217;t help but smile back so I instinctively just smiled and said hello to her. She then nervously laughed and said, &#8220;Oh no&#8230; I was waving to my friend,&#8221; and she points to her friend pulling up in a car, picking the girl up.</p>\n<p>I know this is a classic awkward scenario and if you&#8217;ve ever experienced this then you understand my feels. My super awkward, ashamed feels. Like, let&#8217;s just crawl into a hole in the ground and not come up for air for a good week.</p>\n<p>After that happened, I waltzed right into work and told myself I wasn&#8217;t gonna let that get to me. Just because my day started awkwardly, doesn&#8217;t mean it has to keep going, right? Well, wrong. My next awkward moment tops that one.</p>\n<p>My coworker is making drinks (remember, I work at a coffee shop) and he calls me over to look at the name on the cup. The name on the cup says &#8220;Usher.&#8221; So, we don&#8217;t get this often, but we get it enough. Yeah, yeah, you want us to call out the name &#8220;Tupac, Naruto, or Barack Obama.&#8221; Yeah, I&#8217;ve seen it all. And usually when it happens, I make sure I make them feel super weird about it when they pick up their drink. For instance, if there&#8217;s a bunch of people waiting for their drinks in the lobby, I&#8217;ll call out, &#8220;I got a *insert drink name here* for Shanikwa! Shanikwa, I got your drink right over here!&#8221; I will yell this obnoxiously loud and most of the time, this young White or Asian teeny bopper awkwardly walks up to grab her drink while her friends are in the corner cracking up. But hey, that shit&#8217;s not funny when there&#8217;s an actual Shanikwa in the building. TRY LAUGHING NOW, HUH?!</p>\n<p>But anyways, the cup says &#8220;Usher,&#8221; so I automatically assume it&#8217;s one of those kids. So I laugh and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Okay I got this one&#8230; URSHERRR I GOT YO DRINK RIGHT HERE!&#8221; And this Middle Eastern man in his late twenties-early thirties walks up and grabs his drink. My coworker and I are shocked that it&#8217;s not some young hoodlum trying to fuck with us, so my coworker asks, &#8220;Is that really your name?&#8221; And sure enough, homie says &#8220;Yeah, that&#8217;s my real name.&#8221;</p>\n<p>YYYYEAHH&#8230;. You can imagine the look on my face at this point.</p>\n<p>So then to make things less awkward, the guy says &#8220;I also have a fake name too.&#8221; So then I automatically think &#8220;Omg! So he was kidding all along!&#8221; And I try to follow his game and I tell him, &#8220;Oh me too! My real name is Ariana Grande and my fake name is Ally.&#8221; And then I realize&#8230; homie wasn&#8217;t playing a game. His real name is actually Usher.</p>\n<p>Damnit. I totally just made this awkward situation even awkward-er. Why am I cursed with such a weird personality?!</p>\n<p>After I realized he wasn&#8217;t lying about his name, I told him, &#8220;Oh.. sorry&#8230; totally thought you were messing with me. I was trying to follow that game, but I definitely was playing that game by myself.&#8221;\u00a0The guy was a good sport about it though. Before he left, he chuckled and said, &#8220;Game over.&#8221;</p>\n<p>So there you have it. I don&#8217;t exaggerate or lie when I say I truly just derp around in real life. On a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being normal and 10 being goofy, I&#8217;m a 20. Sometimes arguably a 30. I don&#8217;t even have an adjective for that high of a number.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s just Ally. I&#8217;m just me.

And I guess that technically doesn&#8217;t count because it&#8217;s not a person.</p>\n<p>So let me be clear on one thing &#8211; I AM happy. I&#8217;m not writing these series of posts to prove that I&#8217;m happy to anyone. If you are somehow involved in my life right now, you&#8217;ll just know. My life is on a positive path and I&#8217;m working hard to achieve my goals. Yes, I&#8217;m happy.</p>\n<p>And surprise, surprise. I&#8217;m happy even if I&#8217;m NOT dating! (Say whaaat?!)</p>\n<p>So I was inspired to write about this topic because I just got into a little squabble with a dear friend of mine. I was asking him for help to try to decode this text message I got from a guy and we got into conversation about dating. Specifically, he was asking me why I wouldn&#8217;t give this guy a chance and that I should start casually dating again. I, on the other hand, have a different viewpoint on all that.</p>\n<p>Yes, I have standards. They&#8217;re not unbelievably high or anything, but I have standards. I say this a lot, but I guess people don&#8217;t really get it: I know what I want. So if I know what I want, why should I go on dates with people that I don&#8217;t want to know on that intimate level? I&#8217;m not saying I don&#8217;t want to be friends with them. Of course we can be friends! But why would I go on a date with someone who&#8217;s interested in me if I&#8217;m not interested back? Wouldn&#8217;t that be what we call, &#8220;a pity date?&#8221; I&#8217;m pretty damn sure no guy would be delighted to know that the only reason a girl is going out with him is out of pity.</p>\n<p>Also, I&#8217;m not saying I absolutely don&#8217;t care about what this guy has to say. Like I said, I&#8217;m totally down with being friends! FRIENDS. Meaning, yeah we can hang out in a group setting with OTHER FRIENDS. But don&#8217;t expect me to hang out with you in a one-on-one setting anytime soon.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what makes me mad. Why is it when a girl has standards she&#8217;s considered a bitch, but when she has virtually no standards she&#8217;s considered easy?</p>\n<p>UGH! It just doesn&#8217;t make sense! So if I didn&#8217;t have any standards and just went out with every guy who was interested, you can&#8217;t fcking tell me that you and everyone else wouldn&#8217;t look at that and go &#8220;Damn, homegirl&#8217;s thirsty!&#8221; But lo and behold, the moment I&#8217;m just trying to play it cool and just not date around because I really, truly just wanna do me right now, people are like &#8220;Why you got a stick up your ass?!&#8221;</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s just not fair. It&#8217;s like girls can&#8217;t ever win this stupid, imaginary debate. And if you&#8217;re wondering if I&#8217;m implying there&#8217;s a double standard&#8230; HELL YEAH I&#8217;m implying that! You can&#8217;t tell me that if you saw a happy, single guy who was busy doing his own shit and chasing his dreams, you would find that attractive. Everyone would be all over him. And then when he&#8217;s trying to talk to multiple girls at once, everyone&#8217;s like &#8220;Damn homie! Look at you playing the field!&#8221;</p>\n<p>Why can&#8217;t I fucking play the field? Why can&#8217;t I just do my own thing and if I happen to meet someone that I&#8217;m interested in, I&#8217;ll date him then? Why do I have to be dating around right now just to be accepted in society as &#8220;happy?&#8221; Why can&#8217;t people believe me when I say I&#8217;m fine just doing me right now?</p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>\n<p>On a personal note &#8211; SORRY I went on hiatus without letting you guys know! <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-sad' title=':('>:(</span> Life just got busy and I didn&#8217;t really have time to sit down and blog.

It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve posted anything about anime and I felt it was about time to catch you guys up with what shows I&#8217;ve finished.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1187\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/attackontitan.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1187\" alt=\"Photo from crunchyroll.com\" src=\"https://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/attackontitan.jpg?w=640&#038;h=960\" width=\"640\" height=\"960\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo from crunchyroll.com</p></div>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t know this anime just by looking at this picture, then I am virtually slapping you through your computer screen. This mighty fine piece of epicness is Attack on Titan, or Shingeki no Kyojin. I&#8217;d argue hands down that this show literally took the crown for &#8220;Best Summer Anime&#8221;&#8230; EVER. Usually when I hear a show has a lot of hype I&#8217;m normally that person that tries to stay away from it for the time being, but with the amount of positive feedback I kept hearing about AoT, it was impossible NOT to watch it. And I&#8217;m really glad I did.</p>\n<p>So quick synopsis: The setting is this post-apocalyptic world where humanity resides behind three walls &#8211; Wall Maria, Wall Rose, and Wall Sina. And for a century, humankind has lived peacefully behind these walls. Outside these walls are these giant creatures called titans and they eat humans. One ordinary day, a titan breaches Wall Maria and that&#8217;s where the plot begins.</p>\n<p>The anime follows a young boy named Eren Jaegar who joins the Survey Corps (think of this as our marines) because he has this insane motivation to kill all the titans and journey outside the walls. He experienced his mother being eaten by a titan, so he will stop at nothing until he achieves his goal. He also has his best pals, Mikasa and Armin by his side and the three of them join the Survey Corps and kick titan ass. Yeah, buddy.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s about all I can say without giving too much away. This anime is LOADED with suspense and action. I can&#8217;t tell you enough that every episode is just filled with crazy ass titans and humanity fighting for its life. If you&#8217;re into that whole zombie phenomenon, you&#8217;ll enjoy this. (Not that there&#8217;s any zombies in this, but it&#8217;s the concept of surviving.) So, seriously, CHECK THIS OUT! You can watch it on Hulu and Crunchyroll. Season 1 just ended, so you can literally just start the series today and be caught up with the rest of us in no time.</p>\n<p>On another note, I was surprised to see that this series became SO popular among my dance friends. In my head, I never really mix the two communities together so it was pretty bad ass to see my dance friends so engaged in this anime. I couldn&#8217;t be more proud. <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1188\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/sundaywithoutgod.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1188\" alt=\"Photo from crunchyroll.com\" src=\"https://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/sundaywithoutgod.jpg?w=640&#038;h=960\" width=\"640\" height=\"960\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo from crunchyroll.com</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"line-height:1.5;\">So after watching a thought provoking and intense show like Attack on Titan, I wanted to keep my mind rolling with that same intensity and I landed here. This anime is called Sunday Without God and it&#8217;s beautiful and AMAZING! It&#8217;s not all action packed like AoT, but this show definitely gets you thinking and knows how to pull at your heartstrings like no other.</p>\n<p>So quick synopsis: God has abandoned humanity so now humans can no longer die or procreate. He did however create these humanoids called Gravekeepers that&#8217;s sole purpose is to send the deceased off into the afterlife. The story follows a young girl named Ai. Her mother passed away years before the story takes place. She was the town&#8217;s resident gravekeeper so after she passed away, the position was bestowed upon Ai. No one in her town has died since her mother, until one day when a mysterious man named Hampnie Hambart comes into town and shoots everyone.</p>\n<p>As I&#8217;ve said, this anime isn&#8217;t all action packed and intense like AoT, but this anime will definitely keep you on your toes. The story plays so well into your pathos because each character has a deep storyline. I think what makes this story so moving is because it deals with such a heavy topic like life vs. death. Overall, I definitely recommend this to anyone who&#8217;s looking for a more down-to-earth, thought provoking show to watch. The show is only 12 episodes long and you can watch the entire series on Crunchyroll.</p>\n<p>There was obviously a lot more titles shown this summer, but these are my two favorites that I recommend for those of you who are looking for a new anime to watch or want to get into anime. The Fall 2013 anime line up is in full effect and I&#8217;ve seen some good shit so far! Stay updated with my blog for my next post about what shows to watch this anime season.</p>\n<p>Until then, loves!</span></p>\n<p>-Ally</p>\n", "post_id": 1186, "location": false, "date": "10-09-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["geek girl", "rant", "personal", "video games", "pmx", "pacific media expo", "comikaze", "long beach comic con", "comics", "anime", "lb comic con", "manga", "life update"], "text": "<p>Hello beautiful! It&#8217;s been a LONG while.</p>\n<p>I apologize for the hiatus. I&#8217;m busy with a lot of new and exciting things in my life, so I haven&#8217;t found the time to just sit and write. This post is gonna be more of a rant and life update rather than my usual commentary about geekdom, Asian-American issues, or feminist topics. So if you follow my blog for any of those reasons, you can come back tomorrow. Or if you do find my personal life interesting, then read on, brothas and sistas!</p>\n<p>Well I guess first things first, I&#8217;ll start with what&#8217;s going on in my life. I&#8217;m officially on a competitive hip hop dance team! *insert applause here* It&#8217;s always been a dream of mine to really invest myself in the SoCal dance scene and I&#8217;m very grateful the opportunity has been given to me. I still intern for Boogiezone so now I&#8217;m balancing these two amazing dance activities and I couldn&#8217;t be more appreciative. The only REAL issue I have is that the commute fucking sucks. Like, I&#8217;m not even going to sugar coat it. I get that&#8217;s the sacrifice I have to make in order to pursue my passion, but it&#8217;s just super difficult for me. If I could, I would move out to LA in order to be close to my dance world, but then I run into the problem of not having sufficient funds to be paying rent and supporting myself in general. Ugh, life is TOUGH! These are the dog days, you guys. We just gotta keep working hard until we take our last breath.</p>\n<p>Damn, sorry I got real morbid there. ONTO happier thoughts, I&#8217;m really enjoying my refurbished life as a dancer. Notice how I didn&#8217;t say &#8220;new.&#8221; (Yet I said refurbished which not only is pretty much the same thing&#8230; I made myself sound like a piece of furniture. I shake my head at myself sometimes.) I don&#8217;t want to say this is my &#8220;new&#8221; life because I like to think of our lives as an ongoing journey that continues to reinvent itself day by day. If you&#8217;ve followed my blog for a while now, you&#8217;ll know that I&#8217;ve mentioned a couple times that the end of 2012 and the beginning of 2013 really sucked for me. I really went through a toxic time and lost myself for a bit. But now I&#8217;m proud to say I&#8217;m very happy and at peace with myself. Sometimes you just gotta remove yourself from a situation to truly understand the bigger picture. I&#8217;m happy to say I am in a healthy and happy state of mind and although I do still stress out from time to time, I am grateful for the life I&#8217;ve been given. (And btw, stress is normal! Too much of it is a bad thing.)</p>\n<p>Aside from that, I&#8217;m just finishing up school and working. I&#8217;m trying to find a job out in LA so that I can officially move out, but right now I&#8217;m still searching. Ugh, the struggle is real! And yes I am being picky about what kind of job. I&#8217;ve been working at this coffee shop for almost 5 years. I don&#8217;t need another shitty customer service job, thank you very much. I&#8217;m a semi college graduate&#8230; I need something a little better.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m still attending conventions! I&#8217;ll be going to Comikaze next weekend on Saturday so if you happen to be going, let me know! <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)</span> I love meeting other fellow bloggers in person! I&#8217;ll also be at Pacific Media Expo the following week (also on Saturday) and it&#8217;s kinda up in the air right now, but I might be going to Long Beach Comic Con as well. So if you&#8217;re going to be at any of these conventions in the next month, don&#8217;t be shy, come say hi! I&#8217;ll be cosplaying as Psylocke in her X-Force uniform so let&#8217;s take pictures and be friends. Cuz lord knows I need some.</p>\n<p>Just kidding! It&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m desperate for human interaction or anything. Haha&#8230;.</p>\n<p>Ok I am. I SWEAR I&#8217;M NOT WEIRD! Anyways&#8230;</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m actually prepping to get started on Maid Cafe plans for next year. I&#8217;ve been brainstorming some ideas so all I need to do is just discuss them with my director and get the OK to start implementing everything. I&#8217;m pretty excited, to be honest. Maid Cafe is my baby and I just love watching it grow and become better and better each year. I&#8217;ll be honest, I used to be really fixated on the &#8220;competition&#8221; (a.k.a the other Maid Cafes) but now I&#8217;m just like &#8220;fuck it.&#8221; They&#8217;re gonna do their thing, and I&#8217;m gonna do mine. At the end of the day, that&#8217;s just how it is. The biggest competitor I have is myself and I can only become a better leader if I continue to strive to be better than who I was yesterday. So with that being said, y&#8217;all better be excited for next year&#8217;s Anime Expo. We goin&#8217; in, son.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m trying to save up and buy myself a nice camera so that I can go back to vlogging. (This is why I haven&#8217;t posted any videos on my channel&#8230; in case you were wondering.) So you know what that means! I&#8217;m going to be partaking in Black Friday festivities this year. I AM SO EXCITED! I don&#8217;t know why nerdy shit like this gets me ridiculously pumped, but you best know I&#8217;m already packing my shit and setting up camp. Don&#8217;t underestimate me because I&#8217;m small. I will cut a bitch to get my camera.</p>\n<p>Okaaaayyy maybe not&#8230; but I WILL be aggressive. I&#8217;m going for the sneak attack. You won&#8217;t even see me coming cuz I have the stealth of a ninja. HADOKEN!!</p>\n<p>(Ryu&#8217;s not even a ninja. LOL. Don&#8217;t judge me, it&#8217;s late.)</p>\n<p>Um&#8230; so this post wasn&#8217;t very entertaining like some of my other content. So I&#8217;ll just leave you with one of my crazy ass vines.

Ever since I was young, I&#8217;ve always been involved with heavily female influenced groups, such as studio dance teams, cheer, sorority, and more. Hanging out with other females is something I&#8217;m very used to, and because of this experience, I can talk quite open and honestly about what I like to call &#8220;Girl Culture.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s my personal anecdote for your reading pleasure: On my twitter account, I like to post videos and blog posts from other authors because I like to share content. One time I posted an article from the website Jezebel and one of my twitter followers replied to my tweet to share her disapproval of the article. Now I don&#8217;t expect everyone in the world to have the same opinions and that&#8217;s completely fine. We all come from different backgrounds and were raised in different cultures with different influences. But this person felt the need to really make her case about why this article truly sucked.</p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t write the article; I merely just posted it. But the way she was coming at me turned into a personal attack. How? I don&#8217;t fucking know! One minute we were discussing the article and the next minute she&#8217;s calling me selfish. Um, yeah. That accelerated faster than a naive horny teenage couples&#8217; first sexual encounter.</p>\n<p>What did I learn from this experience? Well, now this person thinks they have me all figured out and probably dislike who they think I am. After this all went down, I had a hard time figuring out why someone would get so fired up and throw personal insults at me&#8230; over someone else&#8217;s article. But you know what? I&#8217;ve learned that the people who resort to personal attacks show a pretty immature side to their character. If people are okay with putting themselves out there like that, then to each their own. Like I said, we were all brought up differently. My parents taught me to always handle every conflict with my dignity still in tact.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s funny how we&#8217;re just socially constructed to hate on each other. If you&#8217;re one of those people who say it&#8217;s a &#8220;natural&#8221; thing that females just hate on each other, then please slap yourself and get a grip on reality. Gender is a socially constructed phenomenon. We&#8217;re taught at birth on how we should behave, which includes teaching females to be insecure about themselves and hate on other females.</p>\n<p>Listen up ladies. It&#8217;s hard enough as it is being an oppressed gender and having to adhere to the social norms in a patriarchal society. Can we all just take a moment and think about how we&#8217;re acting against one another?</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s one thing to not agree with someone&#8217;s upbringing and lifestyle. There&#8217;s people I&#8217;ve met in my life where I don&#8217;t agree with their personal values and ethics, but I never outright lashed out at them because I didn&#8217;t like how she was looking at me or didn&#8217;t like how great her ass looks in those jeans that I like. It&#8217;s normal to have a preference over who you want to hang out with. The difference between that and straight up hating on someone is that you&#8217;re not wasting your breath and energy hating on someone.</p>\n<p>So let&#8217;s try to practice how to be nice, EVERYONE. (this includes every gender.) Stop being an asshole. The holidays are here and people just forget about what really matters. Getting the BEST presents for your loved ones by throwing bitch fits at the mall is not what matters.</p>\n<p>Think about it.</p>\n", "post_id": 1201, "location": false, "date": "11-13-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["relationships", "geek girl", "love", "Daria", "Romeo and Juliet", "Shakespeare", "girlfriend", "dating", "dating world", "non-traditional", "boyfriend"], "text": "<div id=\"attachment_1206\" style=\"width: 535px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/romeo_juliet_1996_1200_l.jpeg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1206\" alt=\"Photo from whimquarterly.com\" src=\"https://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/romeo_juliet_1996_1200_l.jpeg?w=525&#038;h=341\" width=\"525\" height=\"341\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo from whimquarterly.com</p></div>\n<p>You know what&#8217;s funny? Finding romance in unexpected places. Well, I guess it&#8217;s not &#8220;funny&#8221; per se, but it definitely is ironic.</p>\n<p>No, you know what&#8217;s funny? If you remember a couple blog posts back, I wrote about being single and how I didn&#8217;t want to date around. I titled that post &#8220;#1&#8243; because I was expecting to make it into a series of posts about why being a single girl in today&#8217;s modern age is pretty annoying because everyone expects you to find love. But&#8230; now things are different. In a good way of course, but things are different. Because I fell for someone.</p>\n<p>So I&#8217;ve pretty much put myself out there in all my writing. If you&#8217;ve been with me in the beginning, you know I&#8217;ll tell you guys pretty much anything you want to know about me. The life of a blogger, ya know? So let&#8217;s just gossip for a few minutes because&#8230; well, why the hell not.</p>\n<p>This came out of nowhere. Well, I guess I can&#8217;t really say out of NOWHERE&#8230; If I look at it objectively, this definitely has been building up over time. We&#8217;re friends. He was always someone I saw as just another friend. But one magical moment, everything changed. We realized there was something between us that we couldn&#8217;t ignore, and we just let our feelings steer our course. It&#8217;s beautiful, but ridiculously frightening. Not knowing where we&#8217;re going and what will become of us is terrifying, but thrilling at the same time. Isn&#8217;t it funny what feelings can do to your brain? Forget drugs &#8211; I have a natural fcking high.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been reading a lot lately since I finally graduated from college (YAY!) and I started rereading Romeo and Juliet. It&#8217;s literally been almost five years since I picked up that book, but I couldn&#8217;t help but want to reread it. I was watching an episode of Daria, and it was the episode where all the teachers go on strike so Daria had to become a substitute teacher for a bit. She subbed a freshmen English class and tested them on Romeo and Juliet. For some reason, based SOLELY on that part of the episode, I felt compelled to pick up the book and reread it.</p>\n<p>Shakespeare is a genius. I&#8217;m pretty sure you knew that without me having to say it. The fact that his literature is recycled over and over in pop culture is proof that whatever he created was always brilliant. There&#8217;s one part of Romeo and Juliet that I&#8217;ve always remembered &#8211; and it&#8217;s this part that gave me so much insight into the current state of my love life.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s the famous scene where Romeo is wooing Juliet from her balcony. Juliet basically tells Romeo to abandon his name and run away with her. She says, &#8220;What&#8217;s in a name? That which we call a rose. By any other word would smell just as sweet.&#8221; This line is so simple, yet makes SO much sense. Did anyone else read that part and go &#8220;HOLY FUCK. Mindblown. Thanks Shakespeare.&#8221; No? Because I just did. Shakespeare pretty much gave me a brain orgasm. A braingasm.</p>\n<p>Because it&#8217;s TRUE! Relationships nowadays are so different than what they were 50 years ago. There&#8217;s so many types of relationships that not everything has a title. You see, me and this boy are dating, but we&#8217;re not in a relationship. For a little bit, I was confused as fck about that. I kept thinking, we do everything a normal couple does, so why can&#8217;t we have the title? But then everything made sense when I remembered that line from Romeo and Juliet. WHAT&#8217;S IN A NAME?!</p>\n<p>A title is just a title. We just add weight to it in order to make it significant. There&#8217;s plenty of couples nowadays who don&#8217;t believe in marriage but they consider themselves as life-long partners. As with the dating scene, there&#8217;s plenty of couples out there that date, but not date. It may seem complicated in theory, but to each couple, it makes perfect sense. As long as both people&#8217;s needs are being met in the &#8220;relationship,&#8221; then who the fck cares about a title? Because when it comes down to it, only they know how each other feels. It doesn&#8217;t matter if no one else understands&#8230; what matters is that they&#8217;re happy and they understand.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve always been an advocate for non-traditional&#8230; in every sense of the word. But I have to admit, even I got caught up in the black and white of the dating world. I was upset and confused because me and the boy didn&#8217;t have a title. But now that I&#8217;ve come to realize that because the title carries no meaning (unless we give it one), we don&#8217;t need to be constrained by society&#8217;s &#8220;rules&#8221; on how we should act in those specific roles of &#8220;boyfriend&#8221; and &#8220;girlfriend.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Of course we want it to happen someday, but we won&#8217;t know until we cross that bridge. So until then, I don&#8217;t mind him being &#8220;the boy.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "post_id": 1205, "location": false, "date": "12-19-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["2014", "advice", "new years resolution", "life", "happiness"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/balloon.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1212 aligncenter\" alt=\"balloon\" src=\"https://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/balloon.jpg?w=500&#038;h=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" /></a>Happy 2014! I&#8217;M BACK!</p>\n<p>As much as I&#8217;m excited for this brand new year, I have to be honest with you guys: I hate New Years Resolutions. The concept behind them is pretty nice; you make a promise to yourself that you will improve in some aspect that will result in you being a happier person. Sounds legit, right? But here&#8217;s the thing&#8230; why do we put so much emphasis on making these promises at the start of each year? We can make these promises ANYTIME throughout the entire year. And why do we make these promises to ourselves that don&#8217;t correspond to who we are? I mean, you&#8217;re really gonna go to the gym five times a week when you haven&#8217;t done any rigorous physical activity since high school? Whose goals are you making&#8230; yours or society&#8217;s? And to that I say &#8211; fuck that.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">I&#8217;ve been in a funk for the past month. I was on cloud nine in my last blog post and now I&#8217;m telling you upfront that I&#8217;ve been in this stupid, depressed clusterfuck since then. I&#8217;ve tried everything from mindless distractions to consistently writing in my journal. I have to constantly remind myself that a broken heart doesn&#8217;t heal overnight&#8230; especially if you&#8217;re like me and constantly think about shit too often.</span></p>\n<p>But I realized something. Happiness is here. It&#8217;s always been here, but I&#8217;m just refusing to accept it. When I think about my life, I can&#8217;t help but be proud and grateful for all the accomplishments I&#8217;ve made, friends I&#8217;ve kept around, and places I&#8217;ve been to. Just because one aspect in your life isn&#8217;t up to par with what you envision it to be doesn&#8217;t mean the rest of your life has failed. That should just give you motivation to really kick your ass into high gear.\u00a0Sometimes you just have to ask yourself, &#8220;What&#8217;s important to me? What do I WANT and what do I NEED?&#8221; Once you can answer those questions honestly for yourself, that&#8217;s when you can get your shit together and turn those ideas into actions.</p>\n<p>And don&#8217;t ever feel like you need to justify yourself as to why you feel the way you feel. No one can tell you how to feel. Only YOU can internalize that for yourself.</p>\n<p>So here&#8217;s my New Years Resolution from now til&#8230; ever. I want it ALL. *cue High School Musical number right here*\u00a0Anyone? No? Damn you people for not understanding my love for Disney movies. (I&#8217;m mentally shaking my fist at you.)</p>\n<p>But in all seriousness, I want to work on every aspect of myself. I want to grow as a dancer, I want to grow as a leader, I want to become more independent, I want to start vlogging again, I want to grow as a writer, and I want a kick-ass supportive partner that wants to share this crazy journey with me. I want to be a fucking modern day Renaissance Woman.</p>\n<p>I know what you&#8217;re thinking &#8211; &#8220;Whoa, slow down girl! One thing at a time!&#8221; But who&#8217;s to say your methods are what&#8217;s going to work for me? Or that my methods are going to work for you? Maybe my crazy, spontaneous, impulsive way of living makes you uncomfortable. Or maybe it intrigues you. Whatever it does, it makes ME happy. And that&#8217;s all that matters. No one can take that away from me. No government, no institution, no workplace, no friend, no family, and especially no BOY&#8230; can take my right to be happy.</p>\n<p>So here&#8217;s to a good year. 2014, I have a lot of plans for you. I know you&#8217;re going to test me, but I&#8217;m ready. Let&#8217;s kiss and make up. And kiss again. And then you can kiss my ass for testing me. Because I&#8217;m ready to run this shit.</p>\n", "post_id": 1211, "location": false, "date": "01-11-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["lgbtq", "gay marriage", "gay couple", "gender equality", "disney channel"], "text": "<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/KoEBdCsrOVs?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></p>\n<p>Good Morning, loves! Happy Monday.</p>\n<p>This weekend was sure an eventful one in the Pop Culture world. Yesterday night was the 56th Grammy Music Awards and although I don&#8217;t have the patience to sit through an entire award show, the performances were nothing short of amazing. Besides, thanks to my Twitter feed, I found out who won, who lost, and all the cute little gossip in between.</p>\n<p>But I wanted to shed light on another phenomenon that was happening the same night. If you turn your attention to cable television, the Disney channel show &#8220;Good Luck Charlie&#8221; made a great stride toward gender equality by introducing an LGBTQ couple on the show. Basically the premise of the show focuses on the Duncan family and their shenanigans growing up as a middle class, White, American family. Charlie, the youngest of the kids, has a play date with one of her classmates Taylor. Charlie&#8217;s parents, Amy and Bob, talk about how Taylor&#8217;s parents are also coming over to hang out and they grow confused as to who Taylor&#8217;s mom is because they were introduced to two different people. When Taylor and her parents come over, lo and behold, they discover Taylor has two moms.</p>\n<p>Before this episode aired, I remember distinctly seeing some articles floating around the internet about Disney introducing a gay couple and I remember thinking, &#8220;Wow. It&#8217;s about time!&#8221; Because most of the pop culture world tuned in to the Grammys last night, I felt like this event got lost in translation. We need to show Disney channel some love too! (Wow&#8230; didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d ever catch myself saying that.)</p>\n<p>Disney channel has always had a reputation for introducing squeaky clean child stars that for some reason turn into the hot messes of Hollywood, therefore becoming a questionable role model for today&#8217;s youth. However, I feel this important leap into gender equality just goes to show that Disney has still got it in them. I personally hope a lot of children and teenagers watch this episode because it&#8217;s about time we start introducing these archetypes into mainstream television. Especially mainstream television that KIDS watch because as we all know, they&#8217;re the most susceptible to internalizing the information they see in the media at this age.</p>\n<p>Although I would have LOVED to see a colored family and actors that weren&#8217;t all stick skinny, I give Disney channel props for taking a step in the right direction. Sometimes we need to remind ourselves that the fight against injustice is a long, winding road and we&#8217;re battling against centuries of oppression that has become normalized in our society. Any step counts and that&#8217;s all that matters.</p>\n<p>I also find it ridiculously adorable that during the Grammys, hundreds of couples, whether they were gay, straight, bi, or whatever they identify with, got married during Macklemore and Ryan Lewis&#8217; performance of &#8220;Same Love&#8221; with Queen Latifah officiating and Madonna making a guest appearance. My heart cannot handle all these feels, guys. I definitely cried during their performance and I am just so happy that people like them use their platforms to promote equality and change.</p>\n<p>As one of my favorite Youtubers tweeted last night, &#8220;It was a great night to be gay.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Click <a href=\"http://jezebel.com/grammys-featured-mass-wedding-during-same-love-perfor-1509548304\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> to watch Macklemore and Ryan Lewis&#8217; performance of &#8220;Same Love&#8221; at the Grammys.</p>\n", "post_id": 1216, "location": false, "date": "01-27-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["relationships", "lizzie mcguire", "romantic relationships", "hayao miyazaki", "platonic friendships", "kim possible", "feminism"], "text": "<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/25.media.tumblr.com/5e85e1c00fc95c2eb8fca277500ad427/tumblr_n0jgd1yGkT1rvpiyxo4_r3_400.gif\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/24.media.tumblr.com/e56dbcbe77c68716e7b1fa37a9bb4253/tumblr_n0jgd1yGkT1rvpiyxo5_r2_400.gif\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/24.media.tumblr.com/8e3b0ad5aee29b0b97f575d2efd7349a/tumblr_n0jgd1yGkT1rvpiyxo1_r1_400.gif\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/24.media.tumblr.com/8a5b96441c089d9fe747c61913081910/tumblr_n0jgd1yGkT1rvpiyxo2_r3_400.gif\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/25.media.tumblr.com/982cdacdd61679c8ea8fd2704bc1e966/tumblr_n0jgd1yGkT1rvpiyxo3_r2_400.gif\" /><br />\nSo the other day when I was on Tumblr (which is like&#8230; everyday), I found this gif set and reblogged it. I did it for two reasons; 1) I absolutely love Hayao Miyazaki films. That man is brilliant. And 2) I completely agree with this statement. I&#8217;m really hoping this is an actual quote from him, but even if it&#8217;s not, I definitely agree with it. I&#8217;m really getting sick and tired of the generic &#8220;Hollywood&#8221; formula for male-female relationship portrayals on screen.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m sure you have an idea of what message I&#8217;m talking about, right? The message that &#8220;men and women can&#8217;t be friends.&#8221; If you observe any of your favorite television shows, sitcoms, cartoons, movies, etc., you&#8217;ll find that this Hollywood formula is repeated and regurgitated again and again. So it&#8217;s no surprise that we as consumers have internalized that message and now some people truly believe men and women CAN&#8217;T ever be just friends. I mean, really? How sad is this world we&#8217;re living in?</p>\n<p>Men and women CAN be friends and it is definitely possible for them to just inspire each other to live without having romantic feelings involved. So call me optimistic or whatever, but I&#8217;m a firm believe in changing your attitude can really change a movement. If we all just started to believe in something and make it the norm, then it would become the norm. It&#8217;s really not that hard of a concept to swallow.</p>\n<p>One of the main reasons people feel like men and women can&#8217;t be friends is that we can&#8217;t look at each other in a non-sexual way. So you know those arguments you would have with your significant other about &#8220;that girl he was texting from class&#8221; or &#8220;that boy that wanted to meet up with her for coffee?&#8221; Yeah, that&#8217;s US internalizing those messages about men and woman not being able to be friends. Because if we truly believed we can all just be friends, then there would be no fcking issue. BUT THERE IS ONE! And it&#8217;s not anyone&#8217;s fault necessarily, so stop getting angry at your significant other. It&#8217;s no surprise that a society that conditions people to think this way will result in people applying these concepts to their own lives.</p>\n<p>The two shows in my childhood that really pissed me off about this concept were two Disney channel shows: Lizzie McGuire and Kim Possible. In both shows, the protagonist is a female and they&#8217;re both dealing with adolescence, growing up, and finding love. Their supporting characters, Ron and Gordo, are the best friends. Both characters have been childhood friends with the protagonists and harbored romantic feelings for the girls. And just as you&#8217;ve guessed it, they all end happily ever after at the end of both series.</p>\n<p>Let me be real here. This really bothered me. Like, seriously bothered me and I was only 12 or 13 when these shows were playing. The way I can tell if a pairing in a show is a true OTP of mine (one true pairing) is if at the end when they&#8217;re finally together, I&#8217;m genuinely very happy. With Lizzie/Gordo and Kim/Ron, I totally felt like that shit was forced on. As if the producers of both shows were like, &#8220;Ok! Time to end the series. They need to do a big kiss scene and we need to order some fireworks and shit to go off in the background.&#8221; How ridiculous can this get?! Not only were both pairings not really developed throughout the series enough, but it just goes back to what I was saying from the beginning &#8211; the Hollywood formula for male-female relationships.</p>\n<p>Honestly, both series would have been fine if it ended without both pairings ending up together. In fact, it would have been BETTER! Because that would show two strong, young females continue to grow and learn about themselves without having a romantic love interest. This is why kids nowadays think they need to be in relationships! This is why ANYONE thinks they need to be in a relationship! Because this notion that solitude = forever alone, scary, sad, and depressing, emphasizes that we should all be looking for our soul mate at any cost. Whatever happened to the messages that we can thrive in this lifetime as an individual being? Hm? Where&#8217;s that Hollywood formula? Oh wait&#8230; yeah that doesn&#8217;t exist because this whole society is driven by the biblical teachings that we are put on this planet to procreate so procreate we shall do!</p>\n<p>And just for the record, I&#8217;m not trying to be Anti-(insert religion here). I&#8217;m just challenging the ways that we&#8217;ve always been taught to think. Because who&#8217;s to say your way is wrong and my way is right? Or vice versa? We&#8217;re all alive and living our lives, we might as well live it the way we want to, right?</p>\n<p>So let&#8217;s start writing our own stories about friendship and growing up. Let&#8217;s start teaching the youth about respecting all types of friendship. And most importantly, let&#8217;s stop fcking sexualizing everything.</p>\n<p>Now go forth and preach that shit.</p>\n", "post_id": 1235, "location": false, "date": "02-09-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["feminist", "slut", "sexuality", "gender equality", "respect", "dating", "double standard", "feminism", "slut shaming"], "text": "<p>Hey everyone! Happy Thursday!</p>\n<p>Today I wanted to discuss something that&#8217;s been plaguing my mind for a while and I knew I&#8217;ve been wanting to write about it. Just in the two weeks alone, I&#8217;ve heard pretty questionable comments come from my straight male friends that have made me cringe and ask myself, &#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>\n<p>A couple weeks ago, I was at a bar with two of my guy friends and we were talking about this girl that I&#8217;m not personally fond of. My one guy friend asked me to show me her picture and my response was pure confusion. I asked him, &#8220;Why does her physical appearance have anything to do with this? It&#8217;s not going to change the fact that she&#8217;s a mean person.&#8221; When I showed him her picture, he then responded with, &#8220;Oh, she looks like a nice girl! Are you sure you&#8217;re not just overreacting?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Um&#8230; wut? Yeah. Ok.</p>\n<p>Last weekend, I was hanging out with another male friend of mine and he told me about how he went to lunch with a girl who has a &#8220;slutty&#8221; reputation among her peers. His friends didn&#8217;t waste anytime to let him know that he shouldn&#8217;t have hung out with her.</p>\n<p>And this my friends&#8230; is what we call slut shaming.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/easya.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1243 aligncenter\" alt=\"Emma Stone as &quot;Olive Penderghast&quot; in Screen Gems' EASY A.\" src=\"https://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/easya.jpg?w=555&#038;h=350\" width=\"555\" height=\"350\" /></a></p>\n<p>You may or may not have heard of this term before, but EVERYONE regardless of their gender or sexuality should know it and understand it. Why? Because at the core of this problem is that people are not receiving the respect they deserve. And everyone deserves respect. Everyone.</p>\n<p>Slut shaming is used to describe the act of making people feel guilty or inferior for expressing their sexuality in a way that isn&#8217;t orthodox or &#8220;normal.&#8221; Slut shaming has been so ingrained in our culture that it is now a SOCIETY-wide issue; as in, all genders play a part in sharing the blame. It can happen in many ways. For example, it can simply be when a man looks at a woman who&#8217;s getting sexually harassed at a bar and says, &#8220;Well she deserves it. Her skirt is short and her boobs are hanging out.&#8221; Or it can be when a woman looks at another woman and says, &#8220;She&#8217;s fucked so many guys&#8230; that little slut.&#8221;\u00a0And be honest with yourself. You can&#8217;t tell me you&#8217;ve NEVER heard anyone say those things, or you&#8217;ve never thought them yourself.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s some historical background on it &#8211; once upon a time, women didn&#8217;t have any rights and the only person they were allowed to fuck was their husband, a.k.a. the person who had legal ownership over her. Through time, we&#8217;ve opened our minds to allow women to have sex before marriage, but she has to be sure she LOVES him. Otherwise, you&#8217;re a slut for opening up your legs for some random dude. This is where we&#8217;re currently at and quite frankly, that&#8217;s sad.<br />\n<a href=\"http://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/ladylike_sexist.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1242 aligncenter\" alt=\"ladylike_sexist\" src=\"https://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/ladylike_sexist.jpg?w=560&#038;h=565\" width=\"560\" height=\"565\" /></a></p>\n<p>One of my male friends reposted this on his Facebook and I couldn&#8217;t help but cringe at it. You see, THIS is another example of slut shaming. Are you seeing a trend here? Basically, if a woman is labeled as a slut or whore, she gives up all her rights as a human being and we as a society have the right to treat her like the trash she is. IT&#8217;S RIDICULOUS, and I&#8217;m so tired of being bombarded with these messages on a daily basis. Just because someone expresses their sexuality in a way that isn&#8217;t the way you express yours, doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;re any less of a person. These women are exercising their right to have sex whenever they want with whoever they want. And what&#8217;s wrong with that? Men do it all the time.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s because of this notion that our precious va-jay-jay is this pure, untouched temple of heaven and if too many people have gone there, then this place has become a filthy, nasty, trashed up place. To achieve gender equality, we have to stop looking at it like that because it holds everyone to a different standard. And what happens when people don&#8217;t hold up to these standards? Then they become fucking failures that are slutty and stupid.</p>\n<p>Listen up, y&#8217;all. Everyone has the right to express themselves however they see fit. It is their body, and it is their personal choice on what they want to do with it. It&#8217;s a pretty arrogant mentality if you feel like you have the right to tell someone what to wear, when to wear it, if they should have access to birth control, if they should be drinking that much, and so forth. So what I&#8217;m trying to say is&#8230; stop fucking telling people what to do! Stop treating women like they need to act in an appropriate way that YOU see fit in order to gain your respect. They deserve that respect from the beginning. We all do.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/meangirlsslutwhore.gif\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1241 aligncenter\" alt=\"meangirlsslutwhore\" src=\"https://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/meangirlsslutwhore.gif?w=500&#038;h=285\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" /></a></p>\n<p>It really comes down to a power dynamic. Women who behave in a way that is deemed appropriate by men are higher up the totem pole than women who behave in &#8220;bad&#8221; ways that men don&#8217;t approve of. Here&#8217;s a thought &#8211; why don&#8217;t we stop trying to please everyone else and why don&#8217;t we focus on what the fuck makes US happy? Who gives a fuck if someone doesn&#8217;t approve of how you behave? It&#8217;s your life &#8211; do what you want with it. Another person&#8217;s personal choices don&#8217;t affect yours. Stop being fixated on shit that doesn&#8217;t play any relevance to you in your life.</p>\n<p>Stop controlling other people&#8217;s choices. You don&#8217;t have that right.</p>\n", "post_id": 1240, "location": false, "date": "02-27-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["relationships", "body image", "positive body image", "advertisements", "media corporations", "self love"], "text": "<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://31.media.tumblr.com/1baa339179f6e6a6c86943f04f4e71d2/tumblr_n0uvb9qBpn1r46pd2o1_250.gif\" alt=\"\" /><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://24.media.tumblr.com/e1f32d6ba7f82488eab09f62b23aa7b1/tumblr_n0uvb9qBpn1r46pd2o2_250.gif\" alt=\"\" /><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://24.media.tumblr.com/b04ae3b624429ebd4358eedb07e100f4/tumblr_n0uvb9qBpn1r46pd2o3_250.gif\" alt=\"\" /><br />\nEverytime I hear a friend say they wish they were skinnier so they can feel beautiful, a part of me dies on the inside.</p>\n<p>I get it.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s hard to harness self love from within when we live in a world that constantly tells us we&#8217;re imperfect and that we will never achieve happiness in our current state. It&#8217;s always easier said than done. I&#8217;m still learning how to love myself too, so I&#8217;m facing that same struggle.</p>\n<p>As a person who deals in communities that unfortunately do focus on image, I see it all the time. A lot of my peers are always dieting and even if they DO look amazing and lose weight, they&#8217;re still unhappy. They feel they constantly need approval from others in order to feel a sense of acceptance. It&#8217;s a toxic situation and it can easily be stopped if we just took back the power that was stripped away from us.</p>\n<p>Now I&#8217;m not saying the blame is entirely on media companies who make these sad advertisements. It&#8217;s a cycle. Media companies put out these messages, we internalize them, and as a result, we act out how we THINK we&#8217;re supposed to. News flash, my friends &#8211; we&#8217;re not SUPPOSED to do anything we don&#8217;t want to. Especially if it&#8217;s dictated by these media corporations when a majority of the executive board are rich white males.</p>\n<p>Self love comes from within. It comes from a belief that YOU are good enough, no matter what happens in your life. It&#8217;s faith. Faith that what you look like on the outside doesn&#8217;t define how you are on the inside. I&#8217;ve heard of &#8220;self love&#8221; being a narcissistic trait. It CAN be&#8230; if you let it. But loving and accepting yourself is a human necessity. It&#8217;s just as important as breathing, drinking, and eating. You have to love yourself in order to feel complete in this life.</p>\n<p>You can&#8217;t help others if \u00a0you can&#8217;t help yourself. You can&#8217;t love another person if you don&#8217;t know how to love yourself. It sounds simple enough, but you&#8217;d be surprised how many people don&#8217;t apply this concept to their lives.</p>\n<p>So I say, FUCK IT! I&#8217;m tired of the world telling me I&#8217;m not good enough. I&#8217;m tired of being told my curves are a bad thing. I&#8217;m tired of letting other people dictate my happiness.</p>\n<p>So I won&#8217;t. I&#8217;m in charge of my happiness. I&#8217;m the one in control.

Just been takin&#8217; care of things. I think it&#8217;s called life. Oh life&#8230; sometimes you just kick my ass a little too hard.</p>\n<p>But as usual, I&#8217;ve been sitting here thinking a lot about a little bit of everything and I&#8217;ve recently discovered yet a new perspective of myself that I haven&#8217;t given much thought to.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m a bitch. And I&#8217;m totally ok with that.</p>\n<p>Obviously it&#8217;s taken me a while to accept and embrace this fact about myself. You might be sitting here wondering how the hell a commonly degrading word can be empowering, but it can. You just have to change your attitude and control the power dynamic.</p>\n<p>Women are generally taught to be submissive, polite, and quiet. It&#8217;s never really encouraged to speak up, especially against a man. We&#8217;re usually taught to just walk away from things that make us uncomfortable instead of facing it head on. We&#8217;re basically being programmed at birth to aspire to marry and start a family.</p>\n<p>But what happens when a woman doesn&#8217;t follow this formula? As a society, we tend to shun her. We reprimand her for being too vocal and assertive. We make her feel guilty of her sexual choices. We become disappointed in her if she&#8217;s spending too much time at work and not enough time with her family, but criticize her work ethic when she chooses her family over work.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t believe me? We see it ALL the time in the media. The recent controversy with Duke freshmen Belle Knox is one example. The unfortunate incident in Steubenville is another example. Or how about how the government is up in arms about giving women access to birth control? The list goes on and on. And that&#8217;s fucking sad.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m a bitch because I&#8217;m tired of this shit. I&#8217;m tired of people looking at me like some dainty little flower that can&#8217;t handle anything by herself. I&#8217;m tired of people looking at me and judging my life choices, yet if a man were to make the same choices, no one would question him. I&#8217;m tired of people thinking the reason I&#8217;m single is because I&#8217;m so damn picky and I should just lower my standards in order to find someone. No bitch.. I shouldn&#8217;t lower my standards. People should be aspiring to meet my standards if they want to get with me. I&#8217;m an educated woman of color that doesn&#8217;t have time to play with little boys. What happened to all the men?</p>\n<p>If knowing what I want to aspire in life makes me a bitch, then so be it. If being picky about a potential partner makes me a bitch, then so be it. If calling sexist and racist bullshit out when I see it makes me a bitch, then So. Be. It. If you don&#8217;t want to get called out, then don&#8217;t say sexist and racist bullshit. It&#8217;s as easy as that.</p>\n<p>But hey, I&#8217;m human too. I&#8217;m not always this strong-willed, assertive boss ass bitch all the time. I get caught up in my insecurities too. \u00a0I find that surrounding yourself with loving and supportive people really helps. Also, listening to dope ass music that encourages you to be a boss ass bitch also really helps.</p>\n<p>So moral of the story&#8230; ladies, it&#8217;s ok to be a bitch. Because a wise woman named Tina Fey once said, &#8220;Bitches get stuff done.&#8221;</p>\n", "post_id": 1253, "location": false, "date": "04-21-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["kawaii", "avril lavigne", "Japanese culture", "asian american", "pop music", "Japanese", "pop culture", "asian", "asian stereotypes", "Hello Kitty"], "text": "<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/bZsf4F7Oe7A?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></p>\n<p>Oh Avril&#8230; please do us all a favor and just go back to singing about skater boys.</p>\n<p>Avril Lavigne is back and released a new single titled &#8220;Hello Kitty.&#8221; If that doesn&#8217;t already make you somewhat cringe, just listen to the first four seconds of the song where she totally butchers the Japanese language and made people worldwide unanimously go &#8220;SMH.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This sadly isn&#8217;t anything new in the land of pop music. Katy Perry donned a full geisha outfit during the American Music Awards last year and flashback 10 years before that Gwen Stefani donned her whole Harajuku girl posse everywhere she went. Can we all just take a moment and say &#8220;WTF WHITE PEOPLE? WTF.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Cultural appropriation is the adoption of specific elements of one culture by a different cultural group. This is a phenomenon that&#8217;s been happening for years, but has recently been pushed to the forefront of any pop culture discussion thanks to people like Katy Perry and Gwen Stefani. Miley Cyrus doin&#8217; that whole &#8220;thug lyfe, I&#8217;m a bad ass bitch that can twerk&#8221; is yet another example of how one culture appropriates another. This can be a hard concept to understand by some because some people interpret this adopting as a positive thing. Like, we&#8217;re all sharing ideas and we like how this culture does this, so therefore, this is something that should be celebrated, right?</p>\n<p>Well&#8230; no. Not exactly.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s one thing to exchange ideas and celebrate diversity in a RESPECTFUL manner. (Notice how I capitalized the word RESPECTFUL.) It&#8217;s another thing to do a modern day version of colonizing a culture and its people and use their ideas as your own. People are not accessories to your identity. People are people. Appropriating cultures in this manner dehumanizes people and belittles years and years of rich history from these cultures.</p>\n<p>So let me sound off here. It&#8217;s really fucking annoying to see yet another pop star take this aspect of Japanese culture and wear it like a cute pair of shoes. I mean, can you see those robotic, emotionless Asian back up dancers?! That&#8217;s all INTENTIONAL. That was choreographed that way. This song and video is absolutely terrible in every sense of the word.

Straight guys, to be specific. For the past week, I kept thinking why no guys would talk to me. I&#8217;m single, I&#8217;m not terribly ugly, and I&#8217;m a fun person with good vibes. What&#8217;s not to love?!</p>\n<p>Then it hit me. I plaster the word &#8220;feminist&#8221; on all my social media outlets. And that&#8217;s my Achilles&#8217; heel.</p>\n<p>This compelled me to write a piece explaining myself and all the other feminists out there. We get a bad rep because people truly just don&#8217;t know what we do and why we do it. People just see the crazy, irrational, angry personas and think, &#8220;Oh hell naw, I ain&#8217;t getting near that.&#8221; Well, you SHOULD want to get near us. We&#8217;re compassionate, loving people who believe in equality for all.</p>\n<p>Feminism means believing in the social, political, and economic equality of the sexes. (Straight up quoted that from Beyonce&#8217;s album. See, even Queen Bey knows what&#8217;s up!) That&#8217;s ALL it is. It means recognizing the power structures that exist in our society and challenging them to create structures that support everyone of all backgrounds. It means believing that anyone regardless of sex, gender, religion, and ethnicity deserve an equal chance to pursue happiness and liberty.</p>\n<p>So, if YOU believe that, then voila! You&#8217;re a feminist! Yay, welcome to the club! And don&#8217;t be scared; you should be fucking proud to say you believe in equality.</p>\n<p>I hear often from people that they don&#8217;t like the word &#8220;feminist&#8221; and prefer to be called &#8220;humanist&#8221; or &#8220;equalist.&#8221; Here&#8217;s why that&#8217;s toxic in itself. Humanism is rooted from the European Enlightenment. That is, privileged white European men sought to remake humans of the New World in their own image. (Messina-Dysert, 2013). Basically, it&#8217;s founded on patriarchal values that ignore all other gender and ethnic based injustices. Equalists, or egalitarianism, is rooted from the French and means that everyone should be of equal status. It means all humans should be treated equally and have equal opportunities. While that sounds fantastic and it is ultimately what we feminists want, it really dances around the belief that there IS gender inequality in the world. What that says to me is you don&#8217;t understand how patriarchy works. Egalitarianism and feminism go hand and hand, but feminism addresses that there IS an inequality that needs to be fixed. By saying you&#8217;re egalitarian, you deny that there&#8217;s any injustice going on. And real talk, that&#8217;s bullshit.</p>\n<p>Feminism isn&#8217;t about hating men and stripping them of every ounce of power they have. It&#8217;s about allowing everyone else who isn&#8217;t a White male a chance at being treated with respect and equality. So yes, feminism does have the bias of women&#8217;s rights, but look at the history of this country &#8211; of this WORLD. Really, really look at it. If you still don&#8217;t see anything wrong, then I suggest you slap yourself. Because that&#8217;s some fucked up shit.</p>\n<p>The fact that people don&#8217;t even want to be called &#8220;feminine&#8221; is toxic. It perpetuates this notion that displaying any sort of feminine characteristic is degrading and you should be ashamed of it. Are you starting to catch my drift? It&#8217;s not about &#8220;ermahgerd, women just want to be dominant and powerful! Onoz, what about teh mens!?&#8221; Well, what about them? They&#8217;ve had their story told over and over again. They&#8217;ve had their story told in history books, in literature, in movies, \u00a0in comic books, in politics, and in the media.</p>\n<p>So again, I ask you, what about them?</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s an unfair advantage they have and it has to stop. These existing power structures need to be dismantled in order to obtain an egalitarian culture. \u00a0It&#8217;s a long battle, but we can&#8217;t just give up. If we give up, we let all the strong women who dedicated their whole lives to advocating change die in vain. Their efforts can&#8217;t go unnoticed.</p>\n<p>And if you&#8217;re a White male reading this and thinking, &#8220;Well, how the hell does this effect me? I&#8217;m totally on the winning side here.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Indeed you are. This. my friends, is what we call White Privilege. It&#8217;s been debated a lot in the academic and media forums because of Princeton freshman Tal Fortgang&#8217;s essay that Time republished. If you&#8217;re white, you benefit from these existing power structures. That&#8217;s it. It&#8217;s a fact. No one would want to make this up. Trust me, we have better things to do with our time than sit here and make up concepts that put us colored people at a disadvantage.</p>\n<p>So basically what I&#8217;m trying to say is that being a feminist means you&#8217;re a lovely human being that truly has good morals and beliefs. And I think that&#8217;s fucking awesome and cool.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s cool to be a feminist. I think women who are empowered by their knowledge of the world is so amazing. Guys, don&#8217;t be afraid of that. As Iggy Azalea said, &#8220;You should want a bad bitch like this.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m a feminist because I believe in living in a world where my hard work and efforts will grant me the same success that a man&#8217;s would. I&#8217;m a feminist because I want to live in a world where terrorists won&#8217;t kidnap a bunch of girls and threaten them because they don&#8217;t believe women should have the right to an education. I&#8217;m a feminist because I want to live in a world where my daughters won&#8217;t be accused of being a slut if she expresses her sexuality in a way that doesn&#8217;t fit in a conventional mold.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s 2014. It&#8217;s time we make some changes around here.</p>\n", "post_id": 1270, "location": false, "date": "05-12-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["misogyny", "elliot rodger", "masculinity", "sexism", "isla vista shooting", "rape culture"], "text": "<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"https://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/elliotrodger.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-1277 aligncenter\" src=\"https://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/elliotrodger.jpg?w=411&#038;h=307\" alt=\"elliotrodger\" width=\"411\" height=\"307\" />E</a>lliot Rodger</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On May 23, 2014, Elliot Rodger went on a killing spree in Isla Vista, CA, resulting in murdering six innocent people, wounding 13 more, and taking away his own life.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ve probably already heard of this story whether \u00a0you saw it on the news, on your newsfeed on Facebook, or on other blogs, but I wanted to take this opportunity and contribute to the conversation.</p>\n<p>What most national news outlets don&#8217;t really mention or address is the fact that Elliot Rodger is a disturbing misogynistic, entitled asshole with a gun. Oh, I&#8217;m sorry, is that too insensitive of a title for you? Most media coverage of this event seriously write him off as a &#8220;madman&#8221; a &#8220;psycho&#8221; or a &#8220;lonely virgin.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Um, excuse me, but when was it okay to dismiss this boy&#8217;s actions as insane? Whether or not he&#8217;s mentally ill is still left up for discussion, but THIS whole song and dance of &#8220;boy killing girl because girl refuses his sexual advances&#8221; is NOT new. In fact, it&#8217;s like one of those overdone pop songs on the radio that you hear at least every hour in one day. Everyone&#8217;s fucking tired of this shit.</p>\n<p>According to thinkprogress.org, more than one in three women will experience rape, violence, and/or stalking at the hands of an intimate partner in their lifetimes.\u00a0Eighty-five percent of intimate partner violence victims are women. THIS IS NOT A COINCIDENCE! This is our culture trying to tell us that there is some SERIOUS issues we need to work out.</p>\n<p>Elliot Rodger is the by product of our patriarchal society that normalizes rape culture. Now, what is rape culture?</p>\n<p>&#8220;Rape Culture is an environment in which rape is prevalent and in which sexual violence against women is normalized and excused in the media and popular culture.\u00a0 Rape culture is perpetuated through the use of misogynistic language, the objectification of women\u2019s bodies, and the glamorization of sexual violence, thereby creating a society that disregards women\u2019s rights and safety,&#8221; (Marshall, 2013).</p>\n<p>So because we live in a society that pretty much deems it OK to objectify women and treat them like some reward that men are entitled to have, we get people like Elliot Rodger who grow up with this toxic way of thinking. I viewed two of his videos that he uploaded on his YouTube channel before he went apeshit on this massacre, and I honestly couldn&#8217;t even finish a minute of them. This boy is seriously just fucked up in the head. And who do we blame? His parents? His roommates? His friends, if he had any?</p>\n<p>We should ALL take part in the blame. Because like I said, he is the by product of our twisted misogynistic rape culture.</p>\n<p>If this isn&#8217;t a wake up call to action, I don&#8217;t know what the fuck is. How many daughters, sisters, girlfriends, wives, friends, PEOPLE have to die in order for our society to realize that misogyny exists? Why is it so hard for people to admit that misogyny kills?</p>\n<p>I can&#8217;t tell you how many conversations I&#8217;ve had with people that don&#8217;t understand that gender is a social construct. WE have the power to change our attitudes about this world and how we see it. No one&#8217;s forcing you to follow some imaginary manifesto of how to live your life. YOU decide how to live your life. YOU have the power to change how you view things. And that means that these useless ideas of &#8220;what it means to be a boy&#8221; or &#8220;what it means to be a girl&#8221; is GARBAGE! Throw that shit away and write your own story. A story where everyone is deserving of love, happiness, and respect.</p>\n<p>The only good thing that has risen from this terrible situation is the fact that women everywhere took to their social media outlets, outraged at all the injustice, and told their stories using the hashtag &#8220;#YesAllWomen.&#8221; I, myself, participated in this trend and DAMN &#8211; that felt so liberating. I highly encourage you to add your own Facebook status or tweet to the discussion. Trust me, this is a long battle that we have yet to win.</p>\n<p>And if you&#8217;re a man, you can TOTALLY take part in that conversation! This isn&#8217;t some Girls Only Club and you can&#8217;t sit with us. You can add to the discussion too&#8230; as long as you&#8217;re an ally. If you&#8217;re wondering how you can become one, just stop and think. Think about how you would want your daughter to be treated. Think about how you want your mother to be treated. Think about how YOU want to be treated. Then read these stories and realize this is a reality that every woman endures. We don&#8217;t want to put up with this shit anymore than you don&#8217;t want to hear it.</p>\n<p>Ignorance is not cute. Apathy is so not cool anymore. If you remain passive, you become part of the problem. You want to be strong? Then call that shit out when you see it and become part of the movement.</p>\n<p>We get that #NotAllMen are like Elliot Rodger, but you know what? There&#8217;s too many of you who are.</p>\n<p>A friend of mine once said, &#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t have to convince people that everyone is deserving of equality. That should be a basic fundamental right.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I totally agree.

I finally wanted to write about my life as a maid&#8230; in a maid cafe.</p>\n<p>It should come as no surprise to you that I&#8217;m pretty vocal about the fact that I work and manage a Maid Cafe. But let&#8217;s backtrack a little. I get asked all the time, &#8220;What is a Maid Cafe?&#8221; Well, I&#8217;m about to school you on Maid Cafe 101.</p>\n<p>Maid Cafes originated from Akihabara, Japan and it&#8217;s basically an actual cafe, but with a fun role play twist. The waitresses are dressed in maid uniforms and act as &#8220;servants&#8221; (to a degree) and the guests are their &#8220;masters&#8221; or &#8220;mistresses.&#8221;</p>\n<p>So what do you do in a Maid Cafe? Well in the authentic ones, since it&#8217;s an actual cafe, you can order food. The maids will usually decorate your plate in a very cutesy manner and power up your food. And by power up, I don&#8217;t mean any weird Dragonball Z or Street Fighter reference. They do it in a very &#8220;moe&#8221; fashion. Moe (pronounced mo-eh) refers to the adoration of young or innocent-looking female characters. So as you can see, a lot of this culture is derived from anime.</p>\n<p>Aside from eating, your maids will usually entertain you by playing various games with you. At my maid cafe, we love to play jenga. We&#8217;ve all played so much jenga that we&#8217;re pretty much jenga masters.</p>\n<p>(Ok, not really, but that game is the shit. Just saying.)</p>\n<p>Last but not least, my most favorite aspect of the cafe are the performances. The maids usually dance or sing for the guests, making it like a dinner and show kind of feel.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_178\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/maidcafe2012_2.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-178\" alt=\"Group pic! :D\" src=\"https://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/maidcafe2012_2.jpg?w=640&#038;h=401\" width=\"640\" height=\"401\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Group pic! <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-bigsmile' title=':D'>:D</span></p></div>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been doing this for 3 years now and I absolutely love it. It&#8217;s fun to play a character and basically make people smile all day. And now as a manager, I get to coordinate the shows and hire all the wonderful staff. It&#8217;s a pretty good gig, if I say so myself.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">But most importantly, working in maid cafe made me realize a lot about myself. You see, through college, I always felt I needed to have this professional face on all the time. When my friends would ask me what I wanted to do in the future, I always said the typical answer of any Comm major or Journalism major&#8230; &#8220;OH I want to work in PR.&#8221; or &#8220;Oh, I want to do something in entertainment&#8230; like work in E! or Entertainment Tonight.&#8221; I started to feel my professional self was so void of anything I truly loved, which was my geeky side. I&#8217;ve been attending anime conventions for over 11 years now and even if I wasn&#8217;t working for one, I&#8217;d still be an attendee.</p>\n<p>Anime conventions to me are a place where I can just be myself. Growing up, people always made fun of me for liking this &#8220;Asian stuff,&#8221; but at the conventions, I feel like I can be myself and no one will judge me. (Well, almost. But you get my point.)</p>\n<p>I think the best part of working at a Maid Cafe is the people you work with. I would not be having as much fun as I am if it weren&#8217;t for the other maids and hosts (the guys). I&#8217;ve learned a lot from them and we&#8217;ve become a happy, dysfunctional family.</p>\n<p>If you want to understand more and see all of this for yourself, go to one! Maid Cafes are very popular nowadays and they&#8217;re not only in Japan anymore. Just from experience, a lot of anime conventions or anime clubs here in the U.S. have their own Maid Cafe. I encourage you to see this for yourself.</p>\n<p>Have you ever visited a Maid Cafe? Do you work at one too?!

Happy TMI Tuesday.</p>\n<p>So I was actually in the process of writing another blog post about&#8230; well&#8230; let&#8217;s keep it as a surprise for now. But I ended up saving that as a draft and writing this instead. </p>\n<p>So let me be real. I have a midterm at 9 AM. It&#8217;s almost 3 AM and I haven&#8217;t really gotten a lot done. (Oops, sorry parentals.) I&#8217;m way too relaxed right before a big test and honestly, it&#8217;s because I HATE studying. In all my years of being a student, both high school and college, I am absolutely terrible at sitting down and memorizing shit. I&#8217;ve even fancied the thought that maybe my short attention span might be due to A.D.D, but then I realized, I don&#8217;t get THAT distracted. I&#8217;m just straight up lazy and I&#8217;d rather spend my time doing other things.</p>\n<p>If there was a test on the entire series of Sailor Moon or Youtube Star Trivia, dear lord, I would get an A++++. I&#8217;d be that student that everyone wants to cheat off of because they bring their book to every class and actually open the book. </p>\n<p>I titled this post &#8220;Asian Stereotypes&#8221; because this will be one of many blog posts where I address a stereotype that I definitely do not fit. I&#8217;m not sure why Asians are always perceived as smart, but hey, to me that&#8217;s a compliment! I don&#8217;t even have to do anything and I already look smarter than my non-Asian friends. But that goes out the door once you hear me open my mouth and I sprout out nonsense about the most random shit you&#8217;ll ever hear.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I thought it always sucked when my other Asian friends had parents who were super strict on their grades. I&#8217;m lucky to have parents who just trust that I&#8217;m doing well (until they read this post and see that I&#8217;m not getting anything done) and let me pursue what I want to pursue. You know what I&#8217;m talking about, right? Those parents that just expect you to be doctors or nurses or something else that&#8217;s highly regarded as a prestigious career. I for one would be so unhappy if I was forced to study something I didn&#8217;t care about. College is expensive!! Why on earth would I be spending thousands of dollars on a subject I give no fcks about? I&#8217;m happy that I got to study what interested me because it helped shape me into the person that I am today. (Which is a person that loves to talk. Can you believe there&#8217;s a major for that?!)</p>\n<p>In all the anime that I watch, I always admired the bookworms that study hardcore and got top scores on tests. I remember when I was in 3rd grade, I was really inspired by Ami (Sailor Mercury) and one time at a sleepover when my friends and I didn&#8217;t know what to do, I pulled out a random textbook I had and said, &#8220;Hey guys! Let&#8217;s study!&#8221; </p>\n<p>Needless to say those girls aren&#8217;t my friends anymore.</p>\n<p>(Just kidding, we still keep in touch. Kinda.)</p>\n<p>I hate to end this post on such a negative message that studying sucks, because in all honesty, we all do need to study in order to be good people. Even if you&#8217;re not in school, you still have to spend time working hard at your job in order to be great at it. So the moral of the story is, study hard. Read that textbook with laser focus and get good grades, kids.</p>\n<p>Or you can be like me and blog about how much this sucks.</p>\n<p>-Alice</p>\n", "post_id": 142, "location": false, "date": "06-11-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["college", "college graduate", "class of 2013", "post grad revelations"], "text": "<p>Hey there guys! Welcome to my humble abode.</p>\n<p>If you know me well enough, you&#8217;ll know that I have a tendency to start multiple blogs and ultimately discontinue them (cue sad music here). But this time, things are different. This time, I&#8217;m super excited to start this new blog and really get to know my readers on a more intimate level.</p>\n<p>Things are also different this time around because&#8230; well&#8230; I have more time on my hands now. Why, you may ask? Well, if you couldn&#8217;t tell from the freakin&#8217; title of this post, I have semi-graduated! Yes, yes, you may now applaud. I have semi-graduated from Cal State Long Beach from the College of Liberal Arts with a B.A. in Communications Studies.</p>\n<p>Heyyy girl heyyy! I finally did it! But wait whaa&#8230;? What do you mean semi-graduated?</p>\n<p>Ok, so I tricked you. Kind of. I haven&#8217;t technically graduated YET but I will be finished in the fall and then I can have a real celebration of some sorts. Not that I didn&#8217;t celebrate now because I definitely made sure to celebrate the end of an era. I celebrated with a homie you may or may not know well named Jameson. He&#8217;s Irish and deadly. You should meet him sometime. I would show you photographic evidence of how much of the bottle I happened to finish on my own, but I don&#8217;t even know where that bottle is. Yeah, it was one of THOSE nights.</p>\n<p>Ok, let&#8217;s get back on track. The title of this post is &#8220;Post-Grad Revelations&#8221; which means I need to tell you guys what revelations have occurred since I semi-graduated almost two weeks ago.</p>\n<p><strong>5 Things I Learned Once I Graduated College</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>Always have a rehearsed answer for your family when they ask you what your plan is now.<br />\n</em>Let&#8217;s be real. There&#8217;s probably a 80% you don&#8217;t know what the hell you&#8217;re doing today, let alone the rest of your life. But to keep everyone at ease to know you&#8217;re not a complete failure, just rehearse a generic answer so that your great-great-great-great grandparents don&#8217;t start turning in their graves.</li>\n<li><em>Do what you&#8217;re passionate about.<br />\n</em>Most people tend to get extremely lost once they graduate because they feel this expectation has been set on them to immediately dive right into some successful career. But hellooo, that&#8217;s not how life works. (Unless you come from a family of money.) But for us regular folk, we need to work hard. My personal philosophy is do what you&#8217;re passionate about and do it well. You have a college degree now, you don&#8217;t need to take anyone&#8217;s shit! Just do what makes you happy and everything will fall into place.</li>\n<li><em>Alcohol intake <del>needs to</del> should\u00a0be less than 9000.<br />\n</em>First of all, if you don&#8217;t get that &#8220;over 9000&#8243; reference I tend to do a lot, shame on you! I hope Frieza, Cell, and Buu all come and knock your face out.<br />\n(So yeah, it&#8217;s a DragonBall Z reference. Don&#8217;t judge me, bro.)<br />\nBut anyways, if you were the type of college kid who practically came into class hungover everyday, you might want to take a step back and reevaluate what you got goin&#8217; on. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I love 2 for 1 drink specials more than the next person, but we&#8217;re adults now. Let&#8217;s be a little more responsible.<br />\n&#8230;. Says the girl who still watches DragonBall Z. Tee hee.</li>\n<li><em>Create two accounts for all your social networks.<br />\n</em>So this only applies to the people who are going to be working in highly respected fields. You probably don&#8217;t want your boss or coworkers to see your ratchet pictures from last weekend. But if you&#8217;re like me, you should create an alter ego for yourself, give that alter ego his/her own social network and go crazy. You see, I curse like a sailor and admit that I consume more alcohol than I should, so I let that alter ego run wild in her own Twitter account. And now her own blog. But if you&#8217;d like to meet my tamed, professional self, well&#8230; why would you? You&#8217;re no fun.</li>\n<li><em>Last but not least, don&#8217;t forget that it&#8217;s all about the simple things in life.<br />\n</em>Ok you bad ass college grad. I see you with your degree and soon-to-be fancy job. It&#8217;s cool and all that you&#8217;re on a good path, but don&#8217;t forget the little things that make you happy. If you make most of your life pertain to work, you&#8217;re going to be one cynical motherf*cker. If you&#8217;re like me, one of my favorite past times is to spend hours and hours on 9gag. Hey, what can I say&#8230; I love me my internet memes. Baby sloths FTW.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So there you have it. 5 things I&#8217;ve learned thus far. It would have been a longer list, but I just graduated 2 weeks ago so calm down. I&#8217;m practically still a fetus. This list can continue as life goes on. In fact, feel free to add your own! I wanna know what you think. Leave a comment and tell me what you have learned since you graduated from school.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s all I&#8217;ve got! If you somehow find me endearing, make sure to subscribe to my blog. I&#8217;ll be posting some awesome stuff sporadically whenever inspiration hits. You know how us writers do.</p>\n<p>And now I leave you with this ridiculously brilliant meme.

Happy Friday!</p>\n<p>First off I want to thank you for reading my last blog post. It was the most read one I&#8217;ve done so far, so I guess that means that either A) everyone loves Maids, B) everyone loves reading about my personal life, or C) everyone loves Maids. So don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;ve taken all that into consideration and the topic of Maid Cafes will be discussed and maybe even VLOGGED about in future posts. <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-wink' title=';)'>;)</span> (I&#8217;m thinking about launching a Youtube channel&#8230; yay or nay?)</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been working hard the past couple weeks transitioning from spring semester/sorority stuff to summer school, working more hours, and prepping for Anime Expo! So if it sounds like I&#8217;m busy, it&#8217;s because I am. But through all the busy work, I bear good news.</p>\n<p>I finally have my own domain! <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-bigsmile' title=':D'>:D</span> -insert happy cheer- If you haven&#8217;t noticed, my URL address is just AliceVega.com as opposed to AliceVega.wordpress.com. I decided to just go for it because I&#8217;ve always wanted my own domain. So here I am! I&#8217;m like a new woman now.</p>\n<p>Anyways, I wanted to do a fun topic today since it&#8217;s FRIDAY and we&#8217;re getting down and we&#8217;re looking forward to the weekend, weekend. (Get it? No? Ok&#8230;) I had the sudden inspiration to write about my favorite guilty pleasure songs since I actually was listening to <strong>Rebecca Black&#8217;s Friday</strong> song right before this.</p>\n<p>OK so judge me all you want. I know this girl got ridiculously bagged on for having a really dumb song that went viral, but hey, she&#8217;s the one laughing at the end because she made tons of money AND got exposure. Do you know how hard that is to do that?? There&#8217;s millions of artists trying to break into the industry who will probably never get their big break but here&#8217;s this 15-year-old somethin&#8217; that came waltzing in through Youtube and made a statement.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 635px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/rebeccablack.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image\" id=\"i-219\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/rebeccablack.jpg?w=625&#038;h=469\" width=\"625\" height=\"469\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo from nydailynews.com</p></div>\n<p>She made the biggest statements of statements. We have to thank her for letting us know that it&#8217;s Friday and that tomorrow is indeed Saturday and the day after that is Sunday.</p>\n<p>Thank you Rebecca Black. I so excited.</p>\n<p>Anyways, another song I hate to admit I love is <strong>Justin Bieber&#8217;s song &#8220;Baby.&#8221;\u00a0</strong>Do you guys remember when Justin Bieber was just posting videos on Youtube? Because I distinctly remember that period of time and when he released this song, I honestly thought it was two different guys. Don&#8217;t ask me why, I just did. But hey, I&#8217;m a big supporter of Youtubers and as much as people hate on Bieber Fever, deep down I secretly will always support him since he was one of the lucky ones who crossed over to mainstream media.</p>\n<p>Oh and it helps that Ludacris is featured in the song. AND he gives a Starbucks shout out. I just got 10 more cool points. Thanks, Ludacris.</p>\n<p>Okay let&#8217;s move onto the next song.\u00a0<strong>One Direction&#8217;s song &#8220;Kiss You.&#8221;\u00a0</strong>Yeah, I get that this isn&#8217;t their breakout single, but this song is hella catchy. If you haven&#8217;t heard it, I suggest you open up your Spotify and listen to it. Like, even listening to the first 10 seconds will suffice. You can&#8217;t tell me that that&#8217;s not catchy! Everytime I hear this song, I tend to body roll when they sing &#8220;Yea-a-a-hhh&#8221; in the chorus. (Ok, I totally don&#8217;t know how to spell that, but you get the point.) Ooh, I know, so edgy! Body rolling to a One Direction song.</p>\n<p>Again, I am not stopping you from judging me. And I bet now that you&#8217;ve listened to the &#8220;Yea-a-a-ahh&#8221; part, you&#8217;re body rolling to it too. Huh??</p>\n<p>Anyways, the next song I want to talk about is a current one. You might have heard it on the radio since it&#8217;s that mainstream and catchy. It&#8217;s called <strong>&#8220;Bubble Butt&#8221; by Major Lazer Feat. Bruno Mars, 2 Chainz, Tyga, and Mystic.</strong> First of all, that combination of artists just spells a recipe for a hot mess. If you&#8217;ve ever watched the video, you know what I&#8217;m talking about. True story, I watched that entire music video just to see if any of the actual rappers (i.e. Major Lazer, 2 Chainz, etc.) made a cameo and they didn&#8217;t. So now I can say I watch that whole video in its entirety and I wish I didn&#8217;t.</p>\n<p>But damn it, that song is SO catchy.</p>\n<p>The last song I want to discuss is <strong>Miley Cyrus&#8217; Party in the USA.</strong> I&#8217;m not going to say much about Miley herself since she&#8217;s had the whole world pretty much talk about her, but I will say I don&#8217;t hate her nor love her. I used to watch Hannah Montana, so I&#8217;ll just leave it at that. Hey, everybody makes mistakes. Everybody has those days, everybody knows what I&#8217;m talking about &#8212;</p>\n<p>Ok, I&#8217;ll stop. Seriously.</p>\n<p>Are some of these your guilty pleasure songs too? I&#8217;d love to see your list. Leave it below in the comments! <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)</span></p>\n<p>-Alice</p>\n", "post_id": 184, "location": false, "date": "06-14-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["fangirl", "fandom", "fanboy", "anime", "glomp", "obsession", "anime convention"], "text": "<p>If you know me, then it shouldn&#8217;t be a surprise that I&#8217;m a huge fangirl of everything awesome. I have different fandoms and I love them all equally. Sometimes I&#8217;ll have a phase where I&#8217;ll be obsessed with one fandom for a couple of months or years, and then I&#8217;ll switch it up. I guess I do it just to keep things interesting and spice it up a bit.</p>\n<p>So you&#8217;re probably wondering: what the hell is a fangirl and what is a fandom? Well first of all, if you&#8217;re on the internet and don&#8217;t know the answer to at least one of the questions, then shame on you. But it&#8217;s ok &#8211; once you&#8217;re done reading this post, you might find out that you, too, have an inner fangirl/fanboy just waiting to come out.</p>\n<p>Fangirl &#8211; noun<br />\n<strong>1. A rabid breed of human female who is obsessed with either a fictional character or an actor. Similar to the breed of fanboy. Fangirls congregate at anime conventions and livejournal. Have been known to glomp, grope, and tackle when encountering said obsessions.<br />\n</strong>-Credit: <a href=\"http://urbandictionary.com\" target=\"_blank\">Urban Dictionary</a></p>\n<p>First of all, that definition is a little outdated. I mean, who still uses Livejournal? (I haven&#8217;t signed onto mine in almost 6 years now.) If you used Livejournal, you were most likely writing fanfiction (like I was). Livejournal, in my opinion, was used for people in different fandoms to connect and share their love for the fandom. I&#8217;m not sure if people still use it though&#8230; It&#8217;s kinda like a Xanga now. Like, who uses Xanga anymore? That&#8217;s like using a midi file for your website in 2013.</p>\n<p>And you know you&#8217;re a fangirl/fanboy if you&#8217;ve ever used the word &#8220;glomp&#8221; in a sentence. Remember those good ol&#8217; times when you saw that word on t-shirts at almost any convention?! Ahh&#8230; those were the days.</p>\n<p>But now &#8220;glomp&#8221; is so 2003.</p>\n<p>In case you don&#8217;t know what &#8220;glomp&#8221; means, glomp is basically a tackle hug. Only anime fans would know what this means because most anime always has a character glomping another character. You know how some people act out what they see on TV? Yeah, kinda applies here. If you still don&#8217;t really understand what glomping is, here&#8217;s an image I found on google on how to do it right.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/howtoglomp.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image\" id=\"i-268\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/howtoglomp.jpg?w=590\" /></a></p>\n<p>Scary, right? Especially if you&#8217;re the victim.</p>\n<p>I always found it weird that not many of my friends really understood why I had so many obsessions and why I was so infatuated with the fandoms. I mean, if you find something you really love, like a sport, a book, a movie, etc., don&#8217;t you want to find out everything about it? For example, if you love basketball, don&#8217;t you want to watch ESPN and watch every highlight of everyday? Buy the games, wear the jerseys, tweet about it, tweet to your favorite player!? If you&#8217;ve done this, you can consider yourself a fangirl/fanboy. Because this is what fangirling is at the very core.</p>\n<p>But I&#8217;d like to point out that there are different levels of fangirling. You have your extreme fangirls who sleep, breathe, eat their fandoms, and you have your mildly obsessed fangirls who don&#8217;t mind watching the series or movie over and over in the privacy of their own home but wouldn&#8217;t be caught DEAD at an event with other geeks in the fandom.</p>\n<p>As you can see, there&#8217;s a spectrum and depending on how proud you are of your fandom, you may land differently on the spectrum than your friends.</p>\n<p>As for me, I consider myself pretty extreme. I&#8217;m pretty vocal about what I love and I have no shame in telling people so. I go to anime conventions, I&#8217;ve cosplayed, I used to write fanfiction, I still READ fanfiction (both anime and Hunger Games), I&#8217;ve been to plenty of midnight premieres, I have a freakin&#8217; Hunger Games tattoo, one of my sorority paddles is a Pikachu, and I follow all my idols on Twitter and tweet to them. And sometimes they tweet back! <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-bigsmile' title=':D'>:D</span></p>\n<p>OH and I can probably quote some of my favorite Youtubers. Because I&#8217;ve watched their videos THAT much.</p>\n<p>You can call me creepy all you want, but if you&#8217;ve already met me, I bet you didn&#8217;t know half these things that I do. I&#8217;m just good at integrating myself with society so that I don&#8217;t look like that awkward kid in the corner with no social skills. It&#8217;s definitely something I&#8217;ve had to perfect over the years. When I was a kid, I used to sing all the songs in my Rurouni Kenshin: Best Collection CD out loud to all my friends during recess.</p>\n<p>Yeah, as if I wasn&#8217;t teased enough for being the asian kid.</p>\n<p>So now that you know the art of fangirling, you may unleash your inner fangirl/fanboy out to the world. Let that fangirl converse with me sometime. Trust me, you&#8217;re not weird and you&#8217;re definitely not alone.</p>\n<p>Hope everyone has had a great weekend!

Happy Thursday!</p>\n<p>Do you remember back in the day when being a &#8220;geek&#8221; or a &#8220;nerd&#8221; was a bad thing? I mean, remember Screech from Saved By The Bell? Toby Isaacs from Degrassi? Umino from Sailor Moon?! Nerds in mainstream media have always been portrayed as unattractive, unpopular, and uncool. But now I&#8217;d like to argue that here in the year 2013, geeks and nerds have become the coolest kids on the block.</p>\n<p>For the sake of clarity, I will be using the term &#8220;nerd&#8221; and &#8220;geek&#8221; interchangeably because there&#8217;s a difference between the two. Check out Burr Settle&#8217;s article on this topic by clicking <a title=\"here\" href=\"http://slackprop.wordpress.com/2013/06/03/on-geek-versus-nerd/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Flashback to 10 years ago. In elementary school, I had an obsession with Hello Kitty and anime. (Still do, lol.) This was the year I started attending anime conventions with all my older friends. I was one of the &#8220;smart&#8221; kids (which is ironic now because my IQ is totally average.) To put it bluntly, my interests were a lot different than most of my friends my age. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I also loved the mainstream music and pop culture at the time (Spice Girls anyone?) but whenever I would start talking about Dragonball Z or Pokemon in very deep detail, people would look at me funny. And then I&#8217;d realize only a handful of the other kids were just as enthusiastic as I was. That&#8217;s when I realized&#8230; people dubbed us as &#8220;geeks.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The point I&#8217;m trying to make is that being a geek was seen as weird and different&#8230; and not in a good way. I mean, when I would try to talk to the other kids about anime and video games, I always got mixed reactions. The boys in my class would understand whenever I&#8217;d talk about Gundams or DBZ, and the girls would kind of have a general idea if I talked about Sailor Moon. But there was never any moment I can full on geek out with anyone over these things. To avoid being an outcast, I always changed the subject to a topic everyone would know about, just so I can fit in and not be different. Has this ever happened to you? I know I&#8217;m not the only one who has experienced this.</p>\n<p>It didn&#8217;t help that I started cosplaying the year after. Now MOST kids definitely didn&#8217;t understand this shit. They couldn&#8217;t even comprehend why I loved these Japanese cartoons so much, and now I&#8217;m dressing up as the characters and attending conventions? I was always pretty sad that none of my school friends could relate to what I loved.</p>\n<p>Now here we are in present time. The reason why I argue that it&#8217;s cool to be uncool is because the mainstream media has made the &#8220;nerd&#8221; or &#8220;geek&#8221; likable to people. No longer are the days of awkward, isolated social skills, but now we&#8217;re put to the forefront and are admired by many. I mean, Big Bang Theory anyone? One of my sorority sisters told me she loved that show and I was beyond shocked when she told me that it was basically about these group of nerdy friends just being nerdy. I kept thinking, &#8220;Wtf&#8230; Hollywood actually finds this amusing now? Whatever happened to us being so weird and different?!&#8221;</p>\n<p>And I think that&#8217;s just it. Being a nerd or a geek is about being different. It&#8217;s about separating yourself from the &#8220;norm&#8221; and to people nowadays, that&#8217;s cool because we all want to stand out somehow. It&#8217;s seen as people having so much depth and knowledge about different things and it makes them cool. It&#8217;s crazy to think the day has come where my vast knowledge of the first season of Pokemon is actually valuable to people.</p>\n<p>I can distinctly remember a time when the manga section of Barnes and Noble was literally just one shelf. Now if you go to a bookstore, the manga section takes up a whole aisle. The proof is in the pudding, you guys. Just look at how Hollywood has infiltrated Comic Con. I remember when I was younger, there wasn&#8217;t any big shot Hollywood actors and directors there, and if there were, it wasn&#8217;t really emphasized on different news outlets. Now Comic Con has become one of the most anticipated events in the entertainment industry.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not saying any of this is bad. In fact, I welcome the attention! It&#8217;s about time cool stuff like anime, manga, video games, and comic books are getting their chance to shine in the spotlight. Look how well all the comic book movies are doing in the box office.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I&#8217;d like to end on a positive note. This goes out to all the kids who always felt like no one understood their obsession with their favorite anime, comic book, or video game. We&#8217;re the shit. Embrace your geeky and nerdy knowledge. Because people wanna be like us now.</p>\n<p>-Alice</p>\n", "post_id": 295, "location": false, "date": "06-20-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["eating", "food", "potato chips", "Korean barbeque", "McDonalds", "i love food"], "text": "<div style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/snorlax_eat_world_by_jakexalrons1.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image\" id=\"i-340\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/snorlax_eat_world_by_jakexalrons1.jpg?w=650&#038;h=650\" width=\"650\" height=\"650\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Picture from jakexalrons.deviantart.com</p></div>\n<p>Hey guys! Happy TMI Tuesday!</p>\n<p>This is off topic, but I realized I greeted you a &#8220;TMI Tuesday&#8221; last week but I didn&#8217;t even divulge anything TMI about me. I know, what a tease, right?! Sorry I deprived you of that, but rest assure, I won&#8217;t fail you this week.</p>\n<p>But you&#8217;re going to have to wait til the end of the post to find out my weird TMI fact. *insert evil laugh here*</p>\n<p>And don&#8217;t be a bitch and just scroll to the end. Forreall.</p>\n<p>Anyways&#8230; today I wanted to talk about my obsession with eating. Now I know I&#8217;m not the only one who gets excited when there&#8217;s a good deal at McDonalds or there&#8217;s a new taco at Taco Bell, so I&#8217;m asking you nicely to let your inner fat kid run loose for the next couple minutes. That way, my inner fat kid and your inner fat kid can be fat kid BFFs.</p>\n<p>I love all kinds of food. Asian food, Mexican food, American food, Junk food from every country&#8230; yeah, I love it all. I tend to usually crave salty foods, so I&#8217;m more of a chip person than a cookie person. I don&#8217;t know what it is about chips, but I have the ability to eat an entire party bag of chips by myself. It&#8217;s actually more disgusting than admirable, and it&#8217;s definitely not an attractive site to see. Favorite chips would have to be a 3-way tie between hot cheetos, hot fritos, and potato chips. Yeah, I don&#8217;t care if I get all that red stuff on my fingers. Whenever I finish a bag of hot cheetos or hot fritos, I have no shame and just lick/suck the spices off my fingers. But the funny thing is, in public and especially when I&#8217;m among many pretty girls, I do the &#8220;lady-like&#8221; thing and wash my hands because who wants a bunch of pretty, skinny girls to judge you as you suck the red off your fingers? (That&#8217;s what she said. Wait, what?) But as I wash my hands, I always die a little on the inside. What a waste of valuable sucking. (Now THAT&#8217;S what she said.)</p>\n<p>Which brings me to another point. I hate going out to eat with people who eat like a bird. You know what kind of people I&#8217;m talking about. These are the people who basically eat 1/5 of their plate at a restaurant and claim they&#8217;re so full, while you can still eat another 2 plates PLUS dessert. Best example of this scenario is eating all-you-can-eat Korean barbeque with a group of people. If you ever have the displeasure of going with me to a Korean bbq restaurant, I will order multiple plates of brisket and a shit ton of rice paper. Like, I&#8217;m basically ringing the bell every 5 minutes because I&#8217;ll be out of one of the two.</p>\n<p>So I&#8217;m gonna be real. I can eat 2-3 plates of brisket by myself, no lie. Seriously! I&#8217;m usually one of the last people eating because I ain&#8217;t afraid to get my grub on. AND I still have room to eat the ice cream at the end. The trick is to NOT eat rice and be weary of how many sides you eat. The only things I pretty much eat are the brisket, the rice paper, and the lettuce. Also, drink WATER! No iced tea or soda&#8230; that&#8217;s gonna get you full for sure. Haven&#8217;t you seen competitive eaters? They drink water so that they can wash everything down and have room for more. Duh. That&#8217;s like, Fat Kid 101.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know about you, but I&#8217;m the kind of person that likes to have food accompany me with almost anything I do. So if I&#8217;m playing video games, I need food. Watching a movie, I need food. Taking a bath, I need food. Just kidding, but seriously, I need food. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m actually hungry or if I just need something to help me focus at the task at hand, I just like having a snack there.</p>\n<p>I definitely need food if I&#8217;m drinking. I think it&#8217;s because my brain automatically just pairs alcohol and food together like wine and crackers (I&#8217;m just oh so classy). I also think it might be because when I&#8217;m buzzed, I just want comfort food to help me through this crazy time. So whenever I&#8217;m at a party or kickback and you somehow see me in a buzzed state of mind, I&#8217;ll usually be asking for food. Preferably something terrible for you like hot cheetos or some greasy ass tacos.</p>\n<p>But as much as I love all this bad stuff, I really am trying to eat a lot healthier since I am getting older. Let me tell you &#8211; eating healthy is difficult and just straight up sucks. And I know all you nutritionist-healthy-eating-foodie-fitness-gurus are going to come at me with some bullshit like, &#8220;Oh there&#8217;s some healthy options that taste just like the actual stuff!&#8221; No. No it doesn&#8217;t. I don&#8217;t care how delicious you say that pizza might be. It&#8217;s not the same. Quit playing games with my&#8230; stomach. AND heart. (Backstreet Boys throwback!)</p>\n<p>After I got off work tonight, I was so hungry that I decided to stop by a McDonalds to get something to eat because I just couldn&#8217;t wait til I got home. But since I AM trying to eat a little healthier, I actually opted for the &#8220;healthier&#8221; options. If there&#8217;s anything you should know about me, it&#8217;s that one of my favorite foods of ALL time are french fries. McDonalds french fries are THE BEST. It&#8217;s like my weakness. It&#8217;s like&#8230; my kryptonite. Like at restaurants when I have the option between french fries and a salad, it&#8217;s like, HELLO&#8230; why is that even a question? This is America.</p>\n<p>Anyways, at the McDonalds drive-thru, I had an internal battle between my bad side and good side. My bad side was saying, &#8220;Fuck it, just get the french fries. You&#8217;re at McDonalds, for crying out loud, it doesn&#8217;t get any fatter than this.&#8221; But my good side was saying, &#8220;No! There&#8217;s 10 more days until Anime Expo. NO FRENCH FRIES!&#8221; I literally had to ask for a minute at the order menu just to rationalize all this shit in my head.</p>\n<p>At the end, all I ordered was one of their new McWraps. It was the grilled chicken and ranch one, which was actually really good. But no french fries&#8230; <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-sad' title=':('>:(</span> It&#8217;s ok though. Just for the freakin&#8217; wrap, it was already almost $5. Like, seriously McDonalds? $5 for this wrap? Yeah, that made it a little easier to say no to the french fries.</p>\n<p>So what&#8217;s your favorite food? Can you cook? Let&#8217;s let our inner fat kids converse for a bit.</p>\n<p>-Alice</p>\n<p>TMI Fact of the Week: Sometimes I just fall asleep after I work out.

Happy Wednesday!</p>\n<p>So I know I haven&#8217;t put out a post in about 2 weeks now. Sorry! BUT! The reason being is because I&#8217;ve been super busy working for the best anime convention in the country&#8230; Anime Expo! </p>\n<p>So let&#8217;s be real for a sec. This isn&#8217;t gonna be some critique like most blogs do. I&#8217;m not going to rate my experience or anything. For one, I personally work for the SPJA so I wouldn&#8217;t be voicing out those kinds of opinions on here. (My soapbox only has so much limit.) I know I normally rant about other geeky topics, but for this post, I&#8217;d like to give you more of a personal inside look at what I do.</p>\n<p>So this was my first year as manager and boy was I in for a treat. I was an assistant manager last year and there is a definite difference between the two jobs. For one, I never truly understood the operational aspect to Maid Cafe until now. But hey, you gotta fck up a couple times until you learn, right? I honestly was already anticipating some mistakes on my behalf just because I was kinda going into this blindly, but by Day 2 of the convention, I really felt like I got the hang of things.</p>\n<p>Now I&#8217;m obviously not gonna release any top secret information here. (Um, duh?) But I will take a moment to gloat about my staff. You see, I have a pretty big department compared to others and that&#8217;s because my department puts on a show and we&#8217;re the performers. I need a large staff in order to make every guest feel special and appreciated. Not only do my Maids/Hosts dance on stage, they interact and play games with the guests. I know in theory it seems like an easy job, but it actually takes more work than you think. We practice months and months in advanced to be performance ready by con. I would know; I was there coordinating all the rehearsals for BOTH maids and hosts. My staff works hard and it paid off. We sold out 8 out of 9 shows. Booyah.</p>\n<p>Ew, I can&#8217;t believe I just said &#8220;booyah.&#8221; That&#8217;s so 2004.\u00a0</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/maidcafe2013_4.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image\" id=\"i-392\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/maidcafe2013_4.jpg?w=650\" /></a></p>\n<p>See? Aren&#8217;t we just a bunch of cutie patooties?</p>\n<p>To wrap up this corny-ness, I just wanna say that without this group of hardworking people, we wouldn&#8217;t have been able to produce such an amazing experience for our guests. These ladies and gents work extremely hard and I wish I can give them something super duper awesome as my token of appreciation. Ah, the life of a college student. I hope booze will suffice? Just kidding. But seriously.</p>\n<p>So what&#8217;s it like to be a maid or a host? Well, for starters, it&#8217;s a lot of work. I can&#8217;t even begin to explain how many rehearsals we had and how LONG the rehearsals were. We pretty much work 7-8 hour shifts each day of con and our ultimate goal is to put on a great show and keep our guests happy. Something new that my maids and hosts did this year was add &#8220;punishments.&#8221; You see, we have an interaction period where we play games with our guests, such as jenga, apples to apples, pop-up pirate, etc. If you lost, you had to do a punishment of the Maid or Host&#8217;s choosing. Don&#8217;t worry, it&#8217;s not anything bad. Most of the time, it had to do with yelling &#8220;I love Justin Bieber!&#8221; or dancing to Gangnam Style on our stage. Because everyone was doing it, punishments were&#8230; well&#8230; fun. I know, weird, right? I remember when I was just a maid back in 2011 and 2012, I don&#8217;t know if I had the guts to do any sorts of punishments. But surprisingly, guests really had fun with it. Soo&#8230; yay! Brownie points for Ally and her staff!</p>\n<p>My department is such a silly, fun group of people. Like most departments, we have a ton of random inside jokes and because we&#8217;ve been working together for months prior to con, we already had a tight bond by the time AX rolled around. That&#8217;s honestly one of the best things about working for AX. It&#8217;s not everyday that you get to immerse yourself with so many amazing people in this nerdy community of ours. Not only did my awesome staff make my experience awesome, but my fellow managers from other departments are also just amazing people in general. I can&#8217;t help but feel nostalgic and so very grateful for what Anime Expo has done for me. I&#8217;ve been attending AX since 2002 and I never even imagined I&#8217;d be working for it, let alone managing a department. This is definitely not the end for me and I will be back! *insert Terminator voice here*</p>\n<p>And so I lied&#8230; the corny-ness continues. I just really really really love where my life is right now and I wouldn&#8217;t trade it for the world. I have to admit, I&#8217;ve been in a huge funk in the last couple months and I&#8217;ve been very confused and slightly depressed, but thank god for this past weekend and thank god I&#8217;m now surrounded by people who believe in me and want to see me do well. (Have I made you cry yet? Ew, stop that.)</p>\n<p>So to end on a fabulous note, I got this drank in my cup. (Literally&#8230; drinking some wine right now. Heyyyy.) And I&#8217;m raising my glass to you. So you better have a glass too or something or else this shit&#8217;s not cute anymore.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a reason I love doing this. There&#8217;s a reason I will work super hard to produce an amazing show with little benefits for myself. And I know every otaku and staffer reading this will agree with me &#8211; we do it because we love the fandom. I&#8217;m going to leave you with this awesome quote that my amazing div head shared with me:</p>\n<p>&#8220;Fandom is focus. Fandom is obsession. Fandom is insatiable consumption.

Happy Wednesday!</p>\n<p>So I&#8217;ve been dying to write more posts to contribute to my series of blog posts titled &#8220;Ally&#8217;s Awesome Advice.&#8221; Now I&#8217;m no expert at life and I am pretty young, but I do consider myself to have some common sense and determination to live life like a badass person. (Shout out to the new Nigahiga video!) Therefore, I believe I have the street cred to back up what I say.</p>\n<p>First off, I just wanna start off by saying that we need to stop comparing ourselves to others. I&#8217;ll be the first to admit I am very guilty of this. It&#8217;s hard to not compare yourself to your peers! I mean, how many times at school has your friends asked you what you got on an essay or what grade you got on that midterm? Honestly, that&#8217;s no one&#8217;s business but your own so don&#8217;t ever feel obligated to share that shit with them &#8211; even if they are your good friend. And as a dancer, it is almost impossible to not compare yourself to other dancers. I can&#8217;t tell you how many times I&#8217;ve been in class or at a workshop and I just awkwardly stare at the really, really talented motherfcker in the front of the routine. It like gets to the point where I&#8217;m probably making them feel uncomfortable with my staring, but I just can&#8217;t help it. If you&#8217;re a ridiculously good dancer, people are gonna stare. End of story.</p>\n<p>And just to connect to my fellow geeks out there, I KNOW this shit happens in the cosplay world for sure. You know that awkward moment when you&#8217;re walking around at a con cosplaying as your favorite character and then you see another person also cosplaying as the same character and you start to realize they did a phenomenal job and yours is just shit in comparison. C&#8217;mon. We&#8217;ve all had those days. In the cosplay world, it&#8217;s even more intimidating because people are asking for pictures. So if you&#8217;re not getting your picture taken, but the other person has flocks of photographers going to them, it just fcks with your self esteem. I know the feels, bro.</p>\n<p>You ARE special and unique. Wanna know why? Because you are the ONLY &#8216;you&#8217; in this entire world. I know there&#8217;s a Jenna Marbles video out there that discusses this concept in great detail, but I wanted to reiterate that point and remind you that you are an amazing person and you should never let anyone make you feel less than that. So if you&#8217;re dating a douchebag or a sketchy ass girl, make the choice today to MAKE A CHANGE. Life&#8217;s too short to dwell on the losers. We could all DIE tomorrow and you&#8217;d die knowing you were dating an asshole that&#8217;s not right for you. So stop it! If the person you&#8217;re with doesn&#8217;t make you feel like you&#8217;re the best thing that&#8217;s ever happened to him/her, then you need to reevaluate why you&#8217;re dating this person.</p>\n<p>My third point I&#8217;d like to make is to stop calling yourself fat. You&#8217;re not fat. Trust, you&#8217;re just not. Society has built this concept of what beauty is and if you don&#8217;t fit that image, you&#8217;re automatically ugly. I&#8217;m sorry, but who the fck are you to tell me I&#8217;m fat? That&#8217;s what you should be telling all those trashy magazines you&#8217;re reading. As a person aspiring to be in PR, advertisements are meant to make you feel like you&#8217;re a worthless piece of shit and you need to buy this specific product in order to feel like you&#8217;re of value in this world. DON&#8217;T PLAY INTO THOSE MIND TRICKS. You are smarter and better than that. If you want to be healthier, then MAKE THAT CHANGE! Challenge yourself to eat more vegetables and cook at home rather than eat out. Challenge yourself to workout. Oh and with working out, you don&#8217;t need a gym membership to work out. There&#8217;s plenty of home workouts you can do without spending money on a gym pass. For starters, check out the youtube channel &#8220;Blogilates.&#8221; Cassey Ho is a super talented and energetic individual who has tons of awesome workouts that you can do FOR FREE. The internet has everything, you know.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s not to say that working out at home is better than working out at a gym. A gym is a great place to workout with friends and meet new people. I&#8217;m just offering an alternative.</p>\n<p>So let&#8217;s recap, shall we? Don&#8217;t compare yourself to others because you&#8217;re the only beautiful YOU in this entire world. If you&#8217;re in a dead end relationship, save yourself and that person the trouble and move on. And lastly, body image is a mental exercise in itself. Be happy with the body you were born with. Accept yourself!</p>\n<p>I hope this helped you realize that you are indeed an awesome fcking person and no one should ever tell you otherwise. I understand it&#8217;s a process to learn to love yourself and accept every fiber of your being as your own, but we&#8217;re all learning. Even your role models and celebrities are fighting a battle of their own. We&#8217;re all people &#8211; we have the same organs, the same hearts, we have hands, feet, eyes, etc. What makes us different is our ability to think. Use that sexy brain of yours to THINK differently! Don&#8217;t let those advertisements fck with your brain. THINK about them and realize they&#8217;re trying to make you feel like shit. Don&#8217;t let them. You&#8217;re better than that.</p>\n<p>Make the choice to be happy today. Fck feeling sad! Being sad sucks.</p>\n<p>To end on a fun note, my question of the week is, what are some things you&#8217;re awesome at? Get that positivity going!</p>\n<p>And to further end on a funNER note&#8230; TMI fact of the week: I may or may not be addicted to twerking. I&#8217;ll just leave it at that&#8230;</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re going to Comic Con this weekend, HAVE FUN! <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)</span> I wish I can be there.

Way back when I had a Livejournal, I never finished a 30 Day Challenge then either. I think I got to like, Day 7, and then&#8230; I don&#8217;t know. I have a short attention span so I probably went to go eat and I just never came back to it. Anyways, here is present Ally in the year 2013. I&#8217;m going to finish a challenge. That&#8217;s it, end of story. Challenge accepted.

Happy Throwback Thursday!</p>\n<p>So here we are on Day 2 of the 30 Day Blogging Challenge: the meaning behind my blog name. Well, brace yourself because this explanation&#8230; is actually pretty simple and I wish I had a cool story to go along with it, but this is all I got. Sorry to crush your dreams so early in the day. <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-sad' title=':('>:(</span></p>\n<p>&#8220;Alice Vega&#8221; is a name I came up with earlier this year because I wanted an alias or a stage name to go by. My initial thought was if I ever became a New York Times best seller or a famous vlogger, this is the name I want to go by. I know&#8230; how ambitious, right? But after I decided that, I changed all my social media platforms to match this name. So if you haven&#8217;t noticed, my Twitter is xoxoalicevega, my tumblr is also xoxoalicevega.tumblr.com, my instagram is xoxo_alicevega, and of course you know what this blog is called.</p>\n<p>I was really inspired by Beyonce when I made the name. First of all, she&#8217;s a goddess and I freakin&#8217; worship her. Second of all, I really like how she gave her alter ego a name, Sacha Fierce. In interviews, she explains that Beyonce is more reserved and introverted compared to Sacha. Sacha is more outgoing, sassy, and confident. I just really loved that dynamic and I wanted to do it too. Even though there&#8217;s honestly not that big of a difference between Allison and Alice (I mean come on, they both twerk regardless), I want Allison to be the professional face that graduated from a 4-year institution and I want Alice to be the girl who just lives life on the edge and is just straight up electric at what she does.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s actually really fun to have an alter ego! You should try it. Then let&#8217;s have our alter egos meet and have an alter ego party. I&#8217;ll bring the alcohol! I mean, Alice will. Allison frowns upon that behavior.</p>\n<p>Nah, who am I kidding. Allison will also bring alcohol to the party.</p>\n<p>In honor of Throwback Thursday, here&#8217;s a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lQ0rePMD80\">video</a> of me dancing in high school with my song team. Aw yeah, jailbait Ally.</p>\n<p>Ew, no. Stop it.

Well, almost. I just ask that you leave me some love in the comments, please! I want to get to know you too, ya know! It&#8217;s like going on a date and only one person talks the WHOLE time and never shuts up. Like how annoying is that bitch? Don&#8217;t make me be that person! <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-sad' title=':('>:(</span></p>\n<p>Anyways, in case you didn&#8217;t know, last week I got another tattoo. It&#8217;s on my left leg near my ankle and it&#8217;s the Sailor Venus symbol. You know, when she transforms. (VENUS SUTAHH POWAA MAKE UP!) I made a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoPBb8oVshQ\" target=\"_blank\">vlog</a></span><span style=\"color:#1b8be0;\">\u00a0</span><span style=\"color:#222222;\">about it on my Youtube channel so if you haven&#8217;t seen it, go check it out!\u00a0</p>\n<p>I then realized that I never fully addressed why I got this or what it means to me, which is kinda important, right? I mean, this symbol will be on my leg FOREVER so it&#8217;s gotta mean something special.</p>\n<p>All the sailor senshi&#8217;s powers are inspired from Roman mythology. So yes, it&#8217;s not just a coincidence that she&#8217;s Sailor Venus, the soldier of Love and Beauty, and that there&#8217;s Venus, the Roman goddess of Love and Beauty. I&#8217;ve always loved the concept of love and beauty. Love is unconditional and everyone has the ability to do it. With beauty, everyone is beautiful whether you realize it or not. I addressed this in yesterday&#8217;s post, but just because you may not fit what society&#8217;s concept of &#8220;beauty&#8221; is, doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;re not beautiful. There&#8217;s all kinds of beauty, whether it&#8217;s physical or conceptual. You can have a beautiful personality, a beautiful voice, a beautiful faith, etc. Both love and beauty is intangible and that&#8217;s what&#8217;s amazing about it. You can buy all the cosmetics in the world, but at the end of the day, it&#8217;s how you view yourself. That&#8217;s what makes you beautiful.</p>\n<p>*Give yourself bonus points if you sang that last line. Where are all my One Direction fans at?*</p>\n<p>In addition, I also just love Sailor Venus (Minako) as a character. She can be a spaz, but she has a strong sense of justice. She&#8217;s confident, out-spoken, and she cares deeply for her friends. Fun fact: she&#8217;s such a popular character that Naoko Takeuchi (creator of the Sailor Moon series) gave her her own manga series!\u00a0</p>\n<p>I got this tattoo because I love what she stands for. It&#8217;s a reminder to myself that no matter how bad I feel about my body sometimes, I am beautiful no matter what anyone says. I have the power to change my negative views about my body into positive ones. It&#8217;s also a reminder to channel my inner Sailor Venus when times get tough.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As for why I got it on my leg&#8230; um, there&#8217;s no particular reason for that. I originally wanted it on the inside of my arm, but I ultimately decided it would look nicer on my leg.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So yeah, that&#8217;s it! This is why I&#8217;m a motherfcking sailor scout.

Happy Friday&#8230; again!</p>\n<p>So I know it&#8217;s 7 PM on a Friday night and most of you are probably getting ready to go out and wreak some havoc in the world, but before you go, I would like to share some terrible habits I have.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I am probably a level 3 packrat/hoarder. I&#8217;ll never be on that god forbidden show, but I am pretty bad when it comes to throwing shit away. I always think I&#8217;m gonna use stuff later on in life or an item might just have sentimental value to me, but I just have a bad habit of not throwing shit away.</li>\n<li>I can get super competitive when I know I can accomplish something or win. I will stop at nothing until I achieve that goal. Like last night at 3 am, I taught myself the &#8220;Cup Song&#8221; from Lulu and The Lampshades/Pitch Perfect. I had work at 10 am this morning but I didn&#8217;t go to sleep until I perfected the beat. Right before I started writing out this post, I spent an hour practicing the beat while singing the song. That shit&#8217;s harder than it looks! I don&#8217;t know why kids underestimate this! It&#8217;s like&#8230; 85% perfect. (Wow&#8230; oxymoron, much?) I&#8217;ve ALMOST perfected it! ALMOST!</li>\n<li>I have a bad habit of letting my eyebrows get really thick and fuzzy before getting them waxed again. I think this is considered being lazy.</li>\n<li>I eat A LOT of bad food. I can&#8217;t help it&#8230; &#8216;MERICA!</li>\n<li>I can&#8217;t multitask very well. When I&#8217;m doing something, I get in the zone and I can&#8217;t get distracted or else I&#8217;ll fck up whatever I&#8217;m doing.</li>\n<li>I can get frustrated pretty easily.</li>\n<li>I procrastinate more than I&#8217;d like to admit. I think this is again&#8230; being lazy.</li>\n<li>I can be ridiculously impulsive.</li>\n<li>I wish I didn&#8217;t hate the sun so much. Then I could go to the beach or the pool like normal people do.</li>\n<li>Depending on how big the setting is and where I&#8217;m at, I won&#8217;t voice my opinions.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So there you have it! 10 habits I wish I didn&#8217;t have. I&#8217;m actually doing one right now &#8211; I&#8217;m procrastinating on getting ready. I&#8217;m going&#8230; ouuuuuut tonight!</p>\n<p>&#8230;. That was a RENT reference&#8230; ya know&#8230; Mimi&#8217;s song&#8230; That stripper girl&#8230;</p>\n<p>Yeah, I know my musicals too, ok?

Happy Sunday Funday!</p>\n<p>So I know the challenge specifically says to provide a &#8220;picture&#8221; but I decided to be an over achiever and provide a youtube video instead. I know&#8230; I&#8217;m such a rebel breaking all these challenge rules.</p>\n<p>So I&#8217;ve been to my homelands 3 times in my life now and this video is the most recent trip&#8230; back in 2007. (Yes, I know&#8230; I&#8217;m long overdue for a trip back.) It was my grandparents&#8217; 50th wedding anniversary and they wanted to throw a huge party and renew their vows and everything. (insert &#8216;awww&#8217; here) For the reception, my dad and I performed a tango.</p>\n<p>So for those of you who don&#8217;t know, my dad has been a dancer for years and this was actually his career! He&#8217;s been a DI (Dance Instructor) for many years and has even owned his own dance studio in the past. This was the first time he and I ever performed together.</p>\n<p>This was also the first time I ever performed the milonga before. I remember during this part of my life, dance was really big to me and I spent most of my days training at studios. So on the first day of rehearsal, I thought I had this in the bag because of all my dance background. Boy, was I wrong. This shit is harder than it looks, TRUST. The footwork can get crazy and in general, it&#8217;s just different dancing with a partner versus performing on your own.</p>\n<p>Anyways, hope you like this blast from the past. Gosh, I never get to do any good Throwback Thursdays or Flashback Fridays. <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-sad' title=':('>:(</span> That and I also just have bad timing.

Happy Monday!</p>\n<p>Whenever I hear the word &#8220;superhero,&#8221; I can&#8217;t help but think people are going to obviously think of some super human or mutant as the answer, like Superman, The Flash, Spiderman, etc. I&#8217;m actually a big Marvel fan (X-Men FTW!) but when I really sat down and thought about my most favorite superhero EVER&#8230; the only one that came to mind was Katniss Everdeen from The Hunger Games trilogy.</p>\n<p>So I know she has no super powers or she&#8217;s not some sort of mutant, (well, not according to Peeta in the third book, right?! &#8230;. Too soon?) but I LOVE this character. And she&#8217;s a hero. And in my opinion, she&#8217;s pretty super. Sooo&#8230; this totally counts.</p>\n<p>As a character, Katniss is actually pretty stoic, moody, and misunderstood by people, thus coming across as a bitch to some. But if you knew how hard she had to work in order to support her family, you&#8217;d come across that way too. She actually has a big heart and would give the world to her little sister. I mean, she volunteered on behalf of her sister as tribute. Now if that doesn&#8217;t say Sister of The Year, I don&#8217;t know what does.</p>\n<p>I also admire her tenacity. She perfected her hunting skills all by herself after her father passed away. If you&#8217;ve ever taught yourself how to do anything, then you can only imagine what it&#8217;s like to have teach yourself how to kill animals in order to make it through another day. The strength on that girl. How do you NOT applaud that?</p>\n<p>*SPOILER ALERT*</p>\n<p>And when she was asked to be the face of the rebellion, I mean, she just took that role and owned it during a very difficult time in her life when all the districts were relying on her to save Panem. Not to mention that the boy she loves was brainwashed to kill her. She STILL pushed through and fought for everyone&#8217;s freedom because she knew it was the right thing to do. And it pretty much fcked with her psyche at the end of it all and mentally traumatized her. But then again, what soldier doesn&#8217;t come back from war feeling that way?</p>\n<p>And to state the most obvious, she&#8217;s a freakin&#8217; bad ass WOMAN! I love how Suzanne Collins used a FEMALE lead for this story. It&#8217;s so empowering and \u00a0it encourages women to stand up for what they believe in and fight for a better tomorrow.</p>\n<p>I love Katniss and The Hunger Games trilogy so much that I got it tattooed on my back. True story.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/firsttattoo.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-690\" alt=\"firsttattoo\" src=\"https://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/firsttattoo.jpg?w=612&#038;h=612\" width=\"612\" height=\"612\" /></a></p>\n<p>The biggest bird is a mockingjay, which is Katniss&#8217; symbol for the rebellion. The dandelion is Peeta. <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)</span></p>\n<p>I&#8217;m planning on getting this tattoo touched up because it&#8217;s faded a bit since I got it. I&#8217;m also considering adding on an arrow to the mockingjay, but we&#8217;ll see how everything looks.

Happy best day of the week!!</p>\n<p>The only reason I love Tuesday so much is because there&#8217;s so many adjectives/events that go along with Tuesday. For instance, there&#8217;s Taco Tuesday, Tequila Tuesday, TMI Tuesday, and last week I came up with &#8220;Trolling Tuesday.&#8221;</p>\n<p>So celebrate with me, yeah?</p>\n<p>Anyways, the picture I chose for today&#8217;s challenge is a picture of me and my amazing friend Yumi emceeing at our Maid Cafe show this year. I already knew for a fact when I read this challenge that I would use a picture of Maid Cafe. I think I&#8217;ve pretty much made it clear in previous posts why Maid Cafe means so much to me and why it&#8217;s become a big impact on my life. But here&#8217;s the watered down version of it if you don&#8217;t want to go through the trouble of finding those posts:</p>\n<p>Maid Cafe has combined all my skills into one place. I love leadership, organizing events, cosplaying, dancing, interacting with others, meeting new friends, and of course, I love hosting events. Being on the mic or being in front of camera is nothing new for me and I absolutely enjoy every second of it.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s not to say I&#8217;m some weird camera whore or anything. I just love performing in front of an audience.</p>\n<p>When one thing can combine everything you&#8217;re passionate about in one place, then you know it&#8217;s had a big impact on your life.</p>\n<p>Question of the Day: What&#8217;s someone or something that has had a big impact on your life?</p>\n<p>-Alice</p>\n", "post_id": 694, "location": false, "date": "07-23-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["blogger", "versatile blogger", "award", "recommendations"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/versatilebloggernominations.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image\" id=\"i-712\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/versatilebloggernominations.jpg?w=563\" /></a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hey guys!\u00a0</p>\n<p>So when I was at work today, I got this awesome surprise.

She was even interviewed on the Huffington Post!</p>\n", "post_id": 713, "location": false, "date": "07-24-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>Hey guys! Happy Wednesday!</p>\n<p>I apologize in advanced if this post seems rushed, because it is. I have a meeting to go to in a little bit, but I didn&#8217;t forget about you guys! Sometimes life is just hectic and you gotta use every bit of free time you have to your advantage.</p>\n<p>Well this month is practically over, but I&#8217;ll just give you a general idea of some goals I&#8217;m trying to achieve in the near future. My biggest one right now is that I&#8217;m trying to move out. I&#8217;m trying to stay in Anaheim because I still work over here, and I don&#8217;t know what my next big career move is so until then, I&#8217;m trying to stay local. It&#8217;s proving to be a pretty difficult challenge in my life because 1) who the hell wants to live in Anaheim unless you were born here, raised here, or somehow unfortunately work here, and 2) why move out when you can stay with your parents and save money. I&#8217;m at this weird transition in my life where I&#8217;m pretty young, but I&#8217;m getting old and my fellow peers are either still trying to be young or&#8230; yeah they&#8217;re trying to be young. The ones who have their shit together are A) trying to focus on finishing school or B) taking care of other obligations while juggling a job, or C) a combination of everything. So as you can see, this shit makes it almost impossible to find a potential roommate. So yeah, this is my number one short term goal.</p>\n<p>My second short term goal is to get approved to host a dance workshop at a convention. As of now, I submitted an application to SacAnime, and I&#8217;ll also be submitting one to Comikaze. Fingers crossed that someone approves me! <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-heart' title='&lt;3'>&lt;3</span></p>\n<p>Third short term goal is to finally finish school. I only have 3 more classes to take and I&#8217;ll be DONE FOREVER. Thank god. I&#8217;m ready to move on from my college life. I just wanna do big things now.</p>\n<p>Fourth short term goal is to seriously train harder in dance. I&#8217;m finally back in the swing of things, but I&#8217;m still not fully committed. When I mean &#8220;seriously train&#8221; I really do mean seriously train. Like, I gotta go back to 16-year-old Allison when she was able to do everything. Now I&#8217;m old and out of shape. I blame college. And poor eating habits.</p>\n<p>My last short term goal is to keep posting regularly on my blog and youtube channel. I feel like writing and shooting videos is a way for me to keep my sanity in tact. (Well, what&#8217;s left of it anyway.) It&#8217;s become a way for me to really engage with people who understand me and a way for the real, raw, unedited Ally to run loose and not give a fck for once. I&#8217;m truly happy and I feel like I&#8217;m at my best when I blog and shoot videos.</p>\n<p>Question of the Day: What are some of your short term goals?</p>\n<p>-Alice</p>\n", "post_id": 791, "location": false, "date": "07-25-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["min", "dance", "twerking", "twerk", "sexy", "miss a"], "text": "<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/xfqTo4Djvrc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></p>\n<p>Hey guys! Happy Thursday!</p>\n<p>So no, this is not a post for the 30 day blog challenge I&#8217;m doing, but it&#8217;s just been a while since I&#8217;ve written an actual post about shit I care about or that&#8217;s on my mind.</p>\n<p>If you remember one of my older posts, <a href=\"http://alicevega.com/2013/06/17/the-art-of-fangirling/\" target=\"_blank\">The Art of Fangirling</a>, you&#8217;ll know that I&#8217;m going to introduce and discuss a magical subject. Today, I&#8217;m going to rant about twerking.</p>\n<p><strong>Twerk\u00a0</strong>(verb)</p>\n<table id=\"entries\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td id=\"entry_6338551\" colspan=\"2\">\n<div>the act of moving/ shaking ones ass/buns/bottom/buttocks/bum-bum in a circular, up-and-down, and side-to-side motion.</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>-<a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=twerking\" target=\"_blank\">Urban Dictionary</a></p>\n<p>So if you didn&#8217;t know what twerking was before I gave you the definition&#8230; then you obviously have been living under a rock. (A rock with internet connection&#8230;?) Twerking has become a very popular dance craze in the past year. Nowadays, it&#8217;s become even MORE popular thanks to celebrities like Miley Cyrus who like to twerk all day everyday.</p>\n<p>People will record themselves twerking and upload it to Youtube, Vine, Instagram, etc. What&#8217;s the point of it all? Well, if you&#8217;re good at it, then hell yeah put that shit on the internet! This dance was made to be seen. Why would you just twerk to yourself in the mirror ALL by yourself? That&#8217;s no fun. The point is that it&#8217;s a ridiculous, fun, outrageous dance move that was made to turn heads. In more ways than one&#8230; heyyyyy.</p>\n<p>Now you&#8217;re probably thinking why the hell I&#8217;m writing about this. Well, I&#8217;m writing about this because I&#8217;m pretty much obsessed with this movement. And by movement, I&#8217;m not just talking about the dance move, I&#8217;m talking about the phenomenon itself. Who doesn&#8217;t love watching booties bounce?! I&#8217;m a heterosexual female and I appreciate when a girl (or a guy) can booty shake really well. You might be thinking, &#8220;where is this going to get you in life?&#8221; Um, it&#8217;s going to make you feel AWESOME that you can shake your ass like that. Sometimes the answer is just because it makes us HAPPY. Why does anyone do anything? Uh, what&#8217;s the point of life if you&#8217;re gonna stay at home all day trolling the internet and asking why does anyone do anything? Because it makes you happy, right? &#8230; You sick, twisted bastard.</p>\n<p>The video I linked in this post is one of my favorite Kpop stars, Min, twerking at a dance studio. She&#8217;s part of the famous girl group Miss A, managed by JYP. My friend recently sent this to me and I almost died. I&#8217;ve seen my fair share of twerk videos but this one took the cake. I mean think about it. Twerking has become SO popular that a KOREAN POP STAR has uploaded a video of herself twerking on the internet. Welcome to the year 2013.</p>\n<p>Oh and if you&#8217;re wondering if I have any twerk videos&#8230; maybe. Maybe you&#8217;ll get lucky and catch me twerking in one of my vlogs.</p>\n<p>I guess you&#8217;ll never know if you don&#8217;t subscribe, follow me on Twitter, or Like me on Facebook.</p>\n<p>See what I did there?! <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-wink' title=';)'>;)</span> Ok in all seriousness, I don&#8217;t ever plan on making a video like that. Unless I&#8217;m drunk. And I happen to drunkenly upload it while I&#8217;m in a drunken state of mind.</p>\n<p>Question of the Day: Let&#8217;s start a twerk team? #AliceVegaTwerkTeam</p>\n<p>Nevermind.. that&#8217;s a really long hashtag.</p>\n<p>-Alice</p>\n", "post_id": 809, "location": false, "date": "07-26-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["30 day blogging challenge", "dance", "30 day challenge", "cheerleading", "songleading", "hip hop"], "text": "<p>Hey guys!

There&#8217;s actually quite a couple things that I&#8217;m proud that I&#8217;ve accomplished in the past couple days. But I&#8217;m going to choose one that I haven&#8217;t really spoken extensively about on my blog yet. I&#8217;m really proud of my progress with my dance training.</p>\n<p><div style=\"width: 497px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/hiphopsilhouette.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image\" id=\"i-827\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/hiphopsilhouette.jpg?w=487&#038;h=412\" width=\"487\" height=\"412\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo from deviantart.com</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"line-height:1.5;\">(You&#8217;d be surprised of the random shit you find on google images&#8230;)</span></p>\n<p>As I&#8217;ve said, I&#8217;m really proud of my progress with my dancing. I started dancing when I was around 13-years-old. That was the year I joined the dance team at my junior high. At first, I was really reluctant because I come from a family of dancers. Most of my aunts from my dad&#8217;s side all have danced, my dad is actually a former ballroom dance instructor, and my older sister was at her prime with dancing during this time. I wanted to be different so I thought I should join sports to stand out.</p>\n<p>But then I realized I sucked at most of them&#8230; <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-sad' title=':('>:(</span></p>\n<p>But to my own surprise, I discovered I was good at dancing! Yay! So I decided to just embrace it and make it my own. You know what it&#8217;s like being a teenager and not knowing where you fit in. Yeah, that feeling sucked, so I just took this opportunity to shine.</p>\n<p>I continued dancing all throughout high school. I would take classes at different studios and I eventually joined the JV cheer team my sophomore year to get out of doing PE. Let me just put this out there&#8230; I really, really, strongly disliked it. Cheer and dance are like&#8230; distant cousins. They&#8217;re DIFFERENT. I hate the whole sharp angle shit and throwing people in the air. I was the flyer since I&#8217;m a short Asian girl and I was terrified half the time. I almost sprained my ankle doing a stunt. Yeah&#8230; my happy place was at a dance studio with mirrors and a bar and doing across the floor. Not in a grass field with 20 other screaming girls doing back flips.</p>\n<p>Luckily, that only lasted a year because for my junior and senior years, I joined the varsity song team. Song was literally MY LIFE. My pride and joy. I absolutely loved it. For those of you who don&#8217;t know what a songleader is, a song team is basically a dance team with pom poms. We typically do a lot of jazz and hip hop routines. We do cheer with the other cheerleaders, but we&#8217;re not doing stunts or flips like they are. You&#8217;ll see song teams do kicklines (like the Rockettes) or turns, leaps, etc. Basically all the dancey stuff.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m naturally a peppy person so song combined my natural peppyness and my love of dance into one. I hate to toot my own horn (aw, who gives a fck&#8230; this is my blog) but I was voted MVP 3 consecutive years and I was captain for 2 years. So yeah, this was my LIFE.</p>\n<p>When I got to college, I didn&#8217;t really have time for dance anymore because I became the &#8220;A&#8221; word&#8230; an ADULT. I started working part time at Starbucks and I was going to school full time. It was really difficult squeezing in my dance training in all that, but I tried. I never got to dance for any teams because of how busy my schedule always was, but looking back, I totally regret it. Especially now since I staff at Boogiezone. Oh my jeezus. The first thing ANYONE will ask me is &#8220;so what teams have you danced for?&#8221; Sometimes I just want to answer, &#8220;Umm.. in real life? Because I&#8217;ve danced for everyone in my dreams.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Too much? I told you I get weird in here.</p>\n<p>My only pet peeve with the SoCal dance scene is that most people won&#8217;t take you seriously as a dancer UNLESS you&#8217;ve A) won competitions for your studio or B) have danced with multiple teams and won something. So as you see, the common ground between these 2 factors is that you have to be a WINNER!</p>\n<p>People IN the dance scene can argue with me all they want that their team or studio promotes a healthy, open dance environment but if you were in my shoes for a day, you&#8217;d understand that it&#8217;s fcking intimidating as shit to just walk into a hip hop class BY YOURSELF while the rest of the class is from the same team or they&#8217;re all super trained hip hop dancers. Trust me, I&#8217;ve been dancing for years and I can&#8217;t help but feel intimidated by them. I don&#8217;t know how to fcking freestyle! I mean, I can bootyshake but that gets old really fast.</p>\n<p>Anyways, this post turned into more of a rant now, LOL. But in all seriousness, I am SUPER proud of my progress. I feel like I can hold it down now when I&#8217;m in a room full of dancers. It&#8217;s still a work in progress, but I can feel myself improving each week.</p>\n<p>Okay end rant. I&#8217;ll have Day 10&#8217;s challenge posted later tonight. I have to unfortunately be the &#8220;A&#8221; word now. Yeah&#8230; you know what I&#8217;m talking about.</p>\n<p>An astronaut. Catch you later, Space Cowboy.</p>\n<p>-Alice</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "post_id": 820, "location": false, "date": "07-26-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["kpop", "30 day blogging challenge", "30 day challenge", "pop", "music", "hip hop", "jpop"], "text": "<p>Hey guys! HAPPY NATIONAL DANCE DAY!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/pusheengangnam.gif\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image aligncenter\" id=\"i-867\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/pusheengangnam.gif?w=315\" /></a></p>\n<p>Yes, there&#8217;s a National Dance Day and you should celebrate by gettin&#8217; down today. It doesn&#8217;t have to be at a club, silly. Just get down wit&#8217; yo bad self where ever you may be going today. As you can see from my previous post, dance is a huge part in my life and I believe we should all celebrate it.</p>\n<p>With that being said, today&#8217;s challenge is all about the songs I listen to when I&#8217;m in a certain mood! And you damn well know it that I dance to most of these songs.</p>\n<p>So my favorite songs always constantly changing because of new music that comes out. But my general style of music is upbeat, fun, and has a good beat. Which means&#8230; yes I&#8217;m into pop music. Yes, I love hip hop. And yes, I like some EDM.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Happy<br />\n</span>So like I said, my favorite songs are always changing. There&#8217;s quite a few songs I listen to when I&#8217;m happy. I&#8217;m just gonna list them out just to be a bit more organized around here:</p>\n<p>1. Carly Rae Jepsen &#8211; Call Me Maybe<br />\n2. Beyonce &#8211; Get Me Bodied<br />\n3. Kyary Pamyu Pamyu &#8211; PonPonPon<br />\n4. Basically any Girls Generation song<br />\n5. HyunA &#8211; Bubble Pop</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Sad<br />\n</span>Well it depends why I&#8217;m sad. Am I going through a heartbreak, did I have a really shitty day? Did I not get paid enough this week? Context matters!</p>\n<p>But I do want to share my ultimate break up song. Ever since this song premiered in 2003, EVERY single break up I endured, I listened to this song. TRUE STORY. I&#8217;m not even stretching the truth on this one. I don&#8217;t know why I always opted to listen to this song, but there&#8217;s something about it that gives me some weird hope. Thanks, Disney Channel&#8230;?</p>\n<p>But anyways, my ultimate break up song is Hilary Duff&#8217;s &#8220;So Yesterday.&#8221; DON&#8217;T JUDGE ME. It&#8217;s a good song.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Bored<br />\n</span>Wtf? What is &#8220;bored&#8221; music? Does this mean mindless background music that I&#8217;m not really listening to? Because that doesn&#8217;t exist, my friend. Please see the list for Happy music.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Hyped<br />\n</span>Oooh, my favorite kind of music! Don&#8217;t you LOVE music that just hypes you up to do anything? Whether it&#8217;s going out, going to the gym, going on a road trip, etc. Hyped music just makes the world go round. Here&#8217;s my list of songs that keep me hyped up:</p>\n<p>1. Bingo Players feat. Far East Movement &#8211; Get Up (Rattle)<br />\n2. J.Dash &#8211; Wop<br />\n3. Jessie J &#8211; Domino<br />\n4. Pretty much ANY boy band song. Like forreall, cheesy boy band music. Nsync, One Direction, Backstreet Boys, New Kids on the Block, etc.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Mad<br />\n</span>And last but not least&#8230; angry music. I actually haven&#8217;t listened to a lot of angry music in a while because usually when I&#8217;m angry, I want to feel better so I listen to happy music. \u00a0But hey, sometimes, life just sucks and you need music that is up to par with your raging personality.</p>\n<p>1. Linkin Park &#8211; One Step Closer<br />\n2. Linkin Park &#8211; Crawling<br />\nUh yeah&#8230; that&#8217;s all I got. So I guess this just implies Linkin Park are a bunch of angry mtherfckers.</p>\n<p>And there you have it. I hope this gives you a better insight to what kind of music I&#8217;m into. You should dance to these songs in honor of National Dance Day.</p>\n<p>Well.. don&#8217;t dance to Linkin Park. That&#8217;s just weird.</p>\n<p>-Alice</p>\n", "post_id": 835, "location": false, "date": "07-27-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Ryan Higa", "30 day blogging challenge", "DTrix", "30 day challenge", "Youtube", "The Dominic Show", "NigaHiga", "The Fu Music"], "text": "<p>Hey guys!

But have no fear! I have been brainstorming some new content so be on the lookout for that.</p>\n<p>I decided to post 2 challenges together since I&#8217;m already 2 days behind, plus Day 11&#8217;s challenge is kinda whack. I mean&#8230; here&#8217;s another picture I guess.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/ryanhigaandme.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image\" id=\"i-877\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/ryanhigaandme.jpg?w=430\" /></a></p>\n<p>WHAAAT?! You didn&#8217;t know Ryan Higa and I were friends?!</p>\n<p>Just kidding. (I wish though!) My best friend and fellow blogger <a href=\"libreangi.blogspot.com\" target=\"_blank\">Angi</a>\u00a0came with me on Sunday to his free fan meet up in Sherman Oaks, CA. Other than meeting the fabulous Ryan himself, I also got a chance to meet <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/thefumusic\" target=\"_blank\">The Fu Music</a>\u00a0and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/theDOMINICshow\" target=\"_blank\">D-Trix</a>. To say I was happy is an understatement. I really look up to these guys and am so inspired by their creativity and perseverance. They&#8217;re all also incredibly down-to-earth and very charming. Honestly, I was a lucky gal. PLUS&#8230; I was first in line. True story.</p>\n<p>Anyways, onto the next challenge. So technically the challenge states, &#8220;How You Found Out About Blogger and Why You Made One.&#8221; First of all, this is WordPress so we&#8217;ll just replace that. I found out about WordPress from my awesome photographer blogger friend <a href=\"jrafanan.wordpress.com\" target=\"_blank\">Jeremy</a>. He&#8217;s had his blog for a while now and he not only showcases his amazing photography, he also actively blogs about different anime he&#8217;s watching. (Which definitely helps me out when I don&#8217;t know which series to watch next!) I&#8217;ve always been a writer and I&#8217;ve gone through my stages of having a Xanga, LiveJournal, and posting some fanfiction up on Fanfiction.net, but I never had a very stable, consistent blog that I kept up with. I always had a tendency to start one, and then I would just stop posting and forget about it. I made this blog because to me, this was the start of something new. (I really didn&#8217;t intend for that to come out as a HSM reference&#8230; but just go with it.) I just graduated college, and I feel like I&#8217;m finding myself all over again. You know that feeling as a teenager when you don&#8217;t know which circle of friends to hang out with because you know that it will define you as a certain label? I had that feeling again. And I&#8217;m a college graduate! You would think by this age, I would have this shit figured out by now, but I was more confused than ever. I really did feel like I lost myself in the extracurricular activities I was doing, and when I thought about who I am deep down, I didn&#8217;t know who I was anymore.</p>\n<p>I feel like I found myself again by blogging because I was able to be honest and express myself in a pretty direct way. Some people define themselves by the videos they make, the dances they do, or the amount of studying they put in. But blogging provided me this digital soapbox where I can straight up say how I feel. It&#8217;s made me put everything back in perspective and help me realize what&#8217;s important to me in life.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not trying to gain anything from doing this. I&#8217;m really just doing this for myself. It makes me happy to write about my experiences and thoughts on different subjects. I&#8217;m also doing this to get to know my friends on a more personal level. I feel like Facebook statuses or Tweets are so subjective and impersonal and there&#8217;s no way anyone can JUST read those and know how I&#8217;m doing. So I&#8217;m giving all my friends a place where they can truly see how I&#8217;m doing and maybe open up about themselves too.</p>\n<p>If I haven&#8217;t said it before, I&#8217;ll say it again. Thanks so much for reading my posts. Even if you&#8217;re new to this site, or if you&#8217;ve been reading since my very first post, I appreciate the time you&#8217;re taking out of your day to come here. Like I said, let&#8217;s get weird. Or&#8230; not. Just be my friend, damnit.</p>\n<p>-Alice</p>\n", "post_id": 873, "location": false, "date": "07-30-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["relationships", "break ups", "love", "30 day blogging challenge", "relationship advice", "30 day challenge", "its complicated"], "text": "<p>Hey guys! Happy TMI Tuesday!</p>\n<p>So the actual challenge today is &#8220;A Letter to Someone Who Hurt You Recently.&#8221; And if that isn&#8217;t some weird parallel to my life right now, I don&#8217;t know what is. Don&#8217;t worry&#8230; I&#8217;ll explain.</p>\n<p>Just as a side note, I&#8217;m probably not going to stay true to this challenge because I did recently write a letter to someone who hurt me. I said what I needed to say, and that&#8217;s the end of it. I don&#8217;t need to be blasting that information here.</p>\n<p>Soo um, there&#8217;s no easy way to say this so I&#8217;ll just be blunt: I&#8217;m single. I recently got out of a long term relationship. Many of you who keep up with my blog are real life friends of mine so you obviously know who it is. Honestly, there&#8217;s not really much to say about it. I know everyone always expects this dramatic, tragic ending but really&#8230; is that how life always is? Yes, our lives can get pretty fcking crazy and hectic, but sometimes the answers to some of our biggest problems are the most simplest ideas. Now I&#8217;ll answer some of the most common questions that are probably running through your head:</p>\n<p>1) Are you ok?<br />\nYes, I&#8217;m fine. I mean, no break up is ever easy so I&#8217;m not like, COMPLETELY ok. But I&#8217;m doing just fine and I&#8217;m keeping a positive attitude. It helps that I have amazing friends by my side. I really don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;d do without you guys.</p>\n<p>2) What happened?!?!?!111 <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-sad' title=':('>:(</span><br />\nTo answer this in the most accurate and direct way &#8211; LIFE happened. You can&#8217;t expect a happy ending with every person you date; that&#8217;s just a naive way to view life. Life took he and I in two different paths and we could no longer make it work, no matter how hard we tried. And that&#8217;s ok. I wish him the best and I hope he finds happiness.</p>\n<p>And uh&#8230; that&#8217;s all the common questions I could think of. If you want to ask me anything else, then by all means, go for it.</p>\n<p>Break ups are tough and the path back to happiness is always a struggle. What&#8217;s important to know is that you should never feel bad about yourself and think you weren&#8217;t good enough. If anyone ever makes you feel less than you&#8217;re worth, then it&#8217;s time to GTFO of that hot mess. Just because it didn&#8217;t work out with that person, doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;re not good enough for ANYONE. You are a gem, and you are the only YOU in this entire universe. If the person you&#8217;re dating can&#8217;t appreciate that, then fck them!</p>\n<p>Not literally.. but&#8230; you know what I mean.</p>\n<p>And just for the record, I&#8217;m not implying that he thought I was worthless. In fact, he treated me very well. I&#8217;m just speaking on a general break up note.</p>\n<p>Also, if you&#8217;re going through a break up or a hard/complicated time in your relationship, remember to talk it out with someone you trust. It&#8217;s hard to deal with all those feelings by yourself. It&#8217;s overwhelming and you probably won&#8217;t be making rational decisions because of how emotional you might be. So find a trustworthy friend or a counselor and let them feels out.</p>\n<p>My last piece of advice for handling a break up is&#8230; hellooo&#8230; music! In case you didn&#8217;t read some of my previous posts, I mentioned my favorite break up song is Hilary Duff&#8217;s &#8220;So Yesterday.&#8221; This song helps me feel a little stronger and helps me move forward. It might not work for you, so make sure you find a song that really resonates with your situation. If all else fails, blast some Destiny&#8217;s Child.</p>\n<p>For all the women who independent, throw yo hands up at meeee.</p>\n<p>(Please tell me you know that song. Shame on you if you don&#8217;t know that classic Destiny&#8217;s Child song.)</p>\n<p>TMI Fact of the Day: The other day at work, I almost tripped. I got so scared that I was gonna eat shit, that I farted.</p>\n<p>Uh.. yeah. Random. It was really funny when it happened though. My shift lead and I died laughing that night.</p>\n<p>-Alice</p>\n", "post_id": 905, "location": false, "date": "07-31-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["game show", "Amy Okuda", "Youtube", "ISAtv", "asian american", "variety game show", "KevJumba", "Wong Fu Productions"], "text": "<div style=\"width: 320px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/isatvgameshow1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image \" id=\"i-93\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/isatvgameshow1.jpg?w=310&#038;h=174\" width=\"310\" height=\"174\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo courtesy of Youtube</p></div>\n<p>So I&#8217;ll admit&#8230; I&#8217;m a little late on posting about this. But hey, I loved this show so much, I just wanted to share it with you guys in case you haven&#8217;t heard of it.</p>\n<p>So let&#8217;s backtrack a little. ISA is a concert events company that focuses on showcasing rising Asian American talent from online videos. (Basically all the Asian Youtubers in one place.) Founded by the ever popular Wong Fu Productions and Far East Movement, ISA has blossomed into a popular source for Asian American entertainment on the internet.</p>\n<p>So if you&#8217;ve ever seen any game shows from Asia, you&#8217;ll know their game shows are anything but normal. They&#8217;re loud, fun, crazy, and there&#8217;s always some sort of dancing. Well, at least in Filipino game shows anyway. I for one have always found Asian game shows very entertaining and hilarious to watch. My favorite would have to be Silent Library from Japan.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/isatvgameshow2.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image\" id=\"i-106\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://alicevega.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/isatvgameshow2.jpg?w=490&#038;h=327\" width=\"490\" height=\"327\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo courtesy by ISAtv&#8217;s Official Tumblr</p></div>\n<p>ISAtv basically wanted to create their own version of those popular game shows. If you haven&#8217;t watched it yet, you better open up a new tab in your browser and start watching it. Like seriously. I&#8217;m waiting for you to do it. Did you do it yet? Ok&#8230;. good. \u00a0All the contestants in this first episode are popular Youtubers that you might recognize. We have Wesley Chan and Ted Fu from Wong Fu Productions, David Choi, Jen FrmHeadtoToe, Ally Maki, Clara C, Freddie Wong, Brandon Laatsch, Mike Song, and Anthony Lee. Hosted by Amy Okuda and Philip Wang from Wong Fu, the contestants were put in different challenges and if they lost, well, they better be ready. Because Game Master Yoshi (a.k.a. KevJumba) was ready to punish the weak.</p>\n<p>My favorite challenge they&#8217;ve done so far is the game called &#8220;Pass It On.&#8221; The contestants were lined up and separated by a curtain. Starting with either Phil or Amy, they acted out a phrase. The first contestant then had to act out the same phrase, using NO words, to the next contestant. Basically, if the games Charades and Telephone had a baby, this is what it would be. The last contestant then had to act out the phrase to either Phil or Amy, and he/she would guess what the phrase is. If you&#8217;ve ever played the game Telephone as a kid, you&#8217;ll know that people misconstrue messages very easily, so you can only imagine how crazy this game turned out to be. If I ever host a party of some sort, I totally want to play this game.</p>\n<p>ISAtv&#8217;s Youtube channel currently has 3 parts up, and they&#8217;re releasing part 4 of the game show TOMORROW! Based on the preview, it looks like the contestants are going to have to go through some sort of obstacle course. Let&#8217;s hope Yoshi doesn&#8217;t subject them to more torture!</p>\n<p>Just kidding, we totally want to see that. Go Yoshi, go Yoshi go!</p>\n<p>What are some of your favorite Asian game shows?

I don&#8217;t own an ipod. Or an iphone. Or anything Apple. *GASP!* I know, right? What century am I living in?</p>\n<p>Well I currently own a Droid 3 and that&#8217;s because my Droid Pro broke last year and thankfully, a good friend of mine lent me his old phone. So I&#8217;m way behind on any cool apps. Seriously. I just downloaded snapchat about a week ago and I can&#8217;t even record videos because this phone is too old and ghetto. There is a camera in the front so I can technically take selfies if I wanted to, but that camera is so bad, I can&#8217;t even see myself. It&#8217;s like looking into a really dirty mirror. So uh&#8230; yeah. No Vine, no Instagram videos. Le sigh. Life is tough sometimes. #FirstWorldProblems</p>\n<p>But for the sake of the challenge, I will just list my top 10 songs that I pretty much listen to a lot in these recent days.</p>\n<p>In no particular order:<br />\n1. Ariana Grande feat. Mac Miller &#8211; The Way<br />\n2. Bruno Mars &#8211; Treasure<br />\n3. J. Dash &#8211; Wop<br />\n4. Ellie Goulding and Calvin Harris &#8211; I Need Your Love<br />\n5. Daft Punk feat. Pharrell &#8211; Get Lucky<br />\n6. Bingo Players feat. Far East Movement &#8211; Get Up (Rattle)<br />\n7. Chester See, Toby Turner, Wayne Brady &#8211; Whistle While I Work It<br />\n8. Girls Day &#8211; Expectation<br />\n9. Sistar &#8211; Loving U<br />\n10. Touhou: Alice and Marisa &#8211; Sweet Magic</p>\n<p>Question of the Day: What&#8217;s your favorite song at the moment? (I&#8217;m always looking for some new music to listen to!)</p>\n<p>Oh and for those of you at VidCon right now&#8230; you lucky shits.</p>\n<p>Just kidding! I&#8217;m not bitter or anything. I&#8217;ll just waiting outside the con&#8230; for you&#8230;</p>\n<p>-Alice</p>\n", "post_id": 951, "location": false, "date": "08-02-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Legend of Korra", "30 day challenge", "Attack on Titan", "30 day blogging challenge", "Boogiezone"], "text": "<p>Hey guys! Happy Friday!</p>\n<p>So I have no idea why this blog challenge insists on posting so many damn pictures. I mean, where the hell is the &#8220;challenge&#8221; in that?

Itsaaa me. And Miku! I was planning on seriously doing a selfie but Miku jumped in the picture and I couldn&#8217;t turn my best friend down! I mean, look how cute she is!</p>\n<p>I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m over halfway done with this 30 day blog challenge. I meant to note that in yesterday&#8217;s post, buuuut I forgot. Oops.</p>\n<p>I really love doing these challenges because it&#8217;s making me work towards something. Even though at the end of 30 days nothing will physically happen, I&#8217;m still going to be super proud of myself for sticking it out and accomplishing something&#8230; even if it is just writing blog posts.</p>\n<p>Anyways, I had a pretty good week! In literally just one week, I rewatched the first season of Legend of Korra AND I started and am caught up with Attack on Titan. Yeah&#8230; I just have a lot more time on my hands now that I&#8217;m single. So uh&#8230; if you wanna hang out with me&#8230; let me know&#8230; I need human interaction, damnit.</p>\n<p>First of all, KORRA! Ah, need I say more?! Watching it gave me the feels all over again. It&#8217;s such an AMAZING series and the fact that it&#8217;s on cable television from a big network like Nickelodeon just never ceases to amaze me. The Avatar and Korra series are seriously Nickelodeon&#8217;s prized jewels. There&#8217;s no other show on that network that even COMPETES with the level of content, characters, and fight sequences like these shows do. Honestly, the Avatar trilogy is probably what&#8217;s keeping Nickelodeon from dying out. Oh and the Kids&#8217; Choice Awards too, I guess.</p>\n<p>Btw, my current OTP is Korra and Mako. And in case you were wondering&#8230; hell yeah, I&#8217;m gonna be looking up some dirty fanfiction. You know how I do.</p>\n<p>Now onto Attack on Titan. Can I just say I&#8217;ve officially been mindfcked at least 10 times watching this show?! And there&#8217;s only 16 episodes out! And by mindfcked I don&#8217;t mean that the storyline is hard to follow, I just mean that this show is just beyond epic. EVERYTHING from the character development, the artwork, the music, the plot, etc. This shit is TOP NOTCH. And I honestly haven&#8217;t been keeping up with any recent anime, so I really lucked out on this one. Attack on Titan was like the talk of the town at this year&#8217;s Anime Expo, so I decided to see what the fuss was about. Sure enough, I was not let down. If you&#8217;re looking to get into anime or if you need a new anime to watch, I definitely, DEFINITELY recommend this one. You won&#8217;t be disappointed. I seriously stayed up til 5 in the morning two nights in a row just watching episode after episode. It&#8217;s THAT good.</p>\n<p>Other than that, I&#8217;ve just been doing my usual routine. Staffing at Boogiezone has proven to be the best remedy for me, as well as a great stepping stone. In case you don&#8217;t know, I currently intern and staff for Boogiezone Utopia in Torrance, CA. It&#8217;s more than just a dance studio&#8230; it&#8217;s really a dance community where passionate people can mingle and train together. I love hosting the community classes. It&#8217;s been such an honor getting to meet and take class from some of the best choreographers. And the best part is that I get to interview them at the end! Well what do ya know&#8230; my journalism skills just came in handy!</p>\n<p>The best part of staffing/interning at Boogiezone is that I truly get to do what I love, in an industry that I&#8217;m striving to be apart of. It&#8217;s such a win-win situation for me. Plus, I&#8217;ve met so many awesome people so far. I&#8217;m really starting to feel like my life is going somewhere special.</p>\n<p>The last thing that I&#8217;ve been doing is that I recently got back on that work out grind and healthy eating. Let me tell ya, this is proving to NOT be an easy task. I mean, working out is fun, but eating healthy is just so difficult for me! I don&#8217;t know why! Like, I&#8217;ll make good choices sometimes, and then all of a sudden there&#8217;s a bag of hot cheetos. Like wtf?! Where did that come from? Oh yeah, your inner fat kid just insisted on stopping by that 7-11 to buy that. Damnit.</p>\n<p>Again, in case you&#8217;re wondering, I don&#8217;t go to the gym. I work out at home. <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)</span> I watch Cassey Ho&#8217;s channel &#8220;Blogilates.&#8221; She&#8217;s an amazing Youtube fitness guru and I highly suggest you watch some of her stuff. She will destroy you.</p>\n<p>But then you&#8217;ll be so hot and sexy afterwards, so it&#8217;s ok to get destroyed! <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-heart' title='&lt;3'>&lt;3</span></p>\n<p>And that&#8217;s about all I did this week. I&#8217;m going to a Disney audition tomorrow morning so I&#8217;m going to TRY not to stay up all night watching anime or Youtube videos. The keyword is TRY.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll have that Ryan Higa vlog up soon on my Youtube channel, I promise! I&#8217;ve just been really distracted with Legend of Korra and Attack on Titan. Lol. Oops.</p>\n<p>Oh and I&#8217;m really serious about waiting outside the Anaheim Convention Center this weekend to find some Youtubers at VidCon. Soo, feel free to join me! <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-wink' title=';)'>;)</span></p>\n<p>-Alice</p>\n", "post_id": 974, "location": false, "date": "08-03-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}], "edges": [{"data": [0, 26135439, 48452068, 26249919, 44270549, 26249919, 31777923, 26249919, 34947706, 46208392, 26249919, 54397058, 26249919, 24593524, 26249919, 0, 26249919, 51750477, 26249919, 17483822, 26249919, 53155803, 26249919, 0, 0, 0, 26249919, 46208392, 26249919, 0, 26249919, 0, 0, 26249919, 0, 26249919, 0, 26249919, 2823739, 46208392, 46208392, 26249919, 0, 26249919, 0, 26249919, 46208392, 46208392, 44153353, 26249919, 44153353, 26249919, 44153353, 26249919, 0, 0, 56359212, 0, 45057623, 26249919, 0, 0, 26249919, 29946252, 26249919, 18309275, 50886023, 26249919, 50886023, 46208392, 26249919, 26249919, 0, 46208392, 0, 50886023, 26249919, 50886023, 26249919, 52691994, 26249919, 54397058, 0, 26249919, 0, 52691994, 49395480, 26249919, 49395480, 26249919, 24492264, 26249919, 0, 26249919, 0, 52264638, 26249919, 26249919, 46208392, 0, 26249919, 46208392, 26249919, 53197227, 0], "type": "comment", "service": "wordpress"}, {"data": [37002147, 43766696, 48055623, 48452068, 51304795, 53832153, 28226761, 33491637, 48055623, 44270549, 23436342, 31777923, 52693663, 46208392, 45079022, 49276388, 49481547, 805250, 11732274, 805250, 11732274, 17483822, 35496820, 36780267, 44779411, 48055623, 48313173, 50151806, 51750477, 52693663, 53155803, 53832153, 31928911, 35496820, 46208392, 48055623, 51750477, 53832153, 51323863, 805250, 46208392, 49276388, 53935089, 48452068, 39815514, 41943277, 43109026, 49276388, 53679382, 36649053, 38185149, 46208392, 2823739, 3005798, 34752656, 34878870, 40531037, 45639290, 46208392, 49147170, 56422100, 19939638, 28316868, 33886656, 46208392, 46208392, 46208392, 49395480, 618743, 43109026, 46208392, 52743958, 58727054, 618743, 46208392, 48411199, 39348557, 33522050, 46208392, 29518882, 37537254, 39348557, 40044649, 46208392, 58671513, 45981392, 46208392, 50886023, 44283084, 46208392, 58788276, 60762991, 46208392, 64095228, 39348557, 46208392, 39348557, 46208392, 60762991, 51335819, 25975438, 39980836, 18309275, 29946252, 44270549, 47780528, 33491637, 44270549, 48055623, 50886023, 44270549, 46208392, 50886023, 51464985, 52019508, 44011610, 50886023, 44270549, 49276388, 50886023, 51042040, 52691994, 44270549, 44270549, 25676654, 44270549, 46208392, 44270549, 44270549, 29266949, 37529650, 43766696, 44270549, 49395480, 46208392, 52264638, 46208392, 44270549, 49276388, 45824773, 18309275, 29533196, 29643715, 52743958, 53197227, 46208392, 50174521, 52954763], "type": "like", "service": "wordpress"}], "metadata": {"services": [{"username": "Alice Vega", "display_name": "alicevega", "service": "wordpress", "service_url": "https://wordpress.com/", "location": {"location_name": "Southern California"}, "service_id": 26249919, "profile_url": "http://en.gravatar.com/alicevega"}]}}

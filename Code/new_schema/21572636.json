The USGS warns that there will high casualties and economic losses, requiring international response. Seismologists have also confirmed that the quake raised a new island, about 30-40 feet high, off the coast. The island is about half a mile off the coast of Gwadar, in the Arabian Sea. Already, reports the <em>International Herald Tribune</em>, crowds have gathered to see the mountainous, rocky island. Some are claiming it is 100 feet high. It\u2019s not unusual for earthquakes of this magnitude to change the coastline, or even deform the shape of the planet. In 2010, an 8.8 magnitude quake in Chile created new coastlines in that country and changed the shape of the Earth enough to shorten our days by a fraction of a second. Today in Pakistan, estimates of damages are still coming in, and it may be days before we know the full extent of the losses because the quake struck in many regions that are remote. The nearest city to the epicenter is Arawan, where damage is said to be extensive, with houses collapsing and people trapped inside. So far, death tolls hover around 40, but that number is expected to rise as emergency services reach more of the affected areas. The populations near the epicenter may be sparse, but according to the USGS, the problem is that they are extremely vulnerable. <br /></span></h5>\n<h5><span style=\"color:#000019;\">Most homes are made of materials like unreinforced brick masonry, which crumble quickly in quakes and can be deadly. Karachi is another nearby city, with millions of residents, whose homes may have also been affected. People as far away as New Delhi report feeling the quake. The USGS also offers a quick scientific summary of the nature of the quake: The September 24, 2013 M7.7 earthquake in south-central Pakistan occurred as the result of oblique-strike-slip type motion at shallow crustal depths. The location and mechanism of the earthquake are consistent with rupture within the Eurasia plate above the Makran subduction zone. The event occurred within the transition zone between northward subduction of the Arabia plate beneath the Eurasia plate and northward collision of the India plate with the Eurasia plate. The epicenter of the event is 69km north of Awaran, Pakistan, and 270km north of Karachi, Pakistan (population 11.6 million). Right now, as emergency groups gather more information, the best thing we can do is wait to find out more. But it\u2019s very likely that humanitarian aid will be needed, and as soon as we know more we\u2019ll offer an update. \u2013<a href=\"http://io9.com/7-7-magnitude-quake-in-pakistan-just-created-a-new-isla-1377964003\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color:#000019;\"><strong>I09</strong></span></a></span></h5>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://ammi2.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/new-island.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image\" id=\"i-116\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://ammi2.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/new-island.jpg?w=487\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 111, "location": false, "date": "09-24-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["lightening", "typhoons", "animals", "fish", "roar", "Floods", "locusts", "storms", "ocean", "massive kills", "earth", "climate change", "world", "birds", "thunder", "dolphins"], "text": "<p><a title=\"Secular Reports Of Earthly Upheavals By Month \" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXUHDJlAF-w&amp;feature=c4-overview&amp;list=UU6Ck6N7gRst7qwkXdapbLaQ\">Secular Reports Of Earthly Upheavals By Month </a></p>\n<p>You shall be visited of the LORD of hosts with thunder, and with earthquake, and great noise, with storm and tempest, and the flame of devouring fire.

A SO2 plume is also visible on satellite data drifting from the eruption site. No ash can be seen on satellite imagery, only steam, and the area of discolored water (indicator of suspended particles) is small if not has disappeared.

For one, Pompeii was named after a roman general who desecrated the temple and too, the Romans were persecuting God&#8217;s people, on top of destroying the place by His name, the footstool of His throne and the apples of His eye.</span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"color:#003366;\"><span class=\"reftext\"><a href=\"http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-14.htm\"><span style=\"color:#003366;\">14</span></a></span>So the angel who was speaking with me said to me, &#8220;Proclaim, saying, &#8216;Thus says the LORD of hosts, &#8220;I am exceedingly jealous for Jerusalem and Zion. <span class=\"reftext\"><a href=\"http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-15.htm\"><span style=\"color:#003366;\">15</span></a></span><span class=\"highl\">&#8220;But I am very angry with the nations who are at ease; for while I was only a little angry, they furthered the disaster.&#8221;</span> <span class=\"reftext\"><a href=\"http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-16.htm\"><span style=\"color:#003366;\">16</span></a></span>&#8216;Therefore thus says the LORD, &#8220;I will return to Jerusalem with compassion; My house will be built in it,&#8221; declares the LORD of hosts, &#8220;and a measuring line will be stretched over Jerusalem.&#8221;&#8216;</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">What happened to Pompeii is completely in line with what God did to the Egyptians, the Assyrians and the Babylonians.

A connection between Zechariah 14 had also come to mind in the aftermath of Nagasaki and Hiroshima. Now you know why so many people today think that Israel will be the victim of a nuclear war. And it was a legitimate leap considering that most people had never seen the aftermath of a pyroclastic flow. But just as God is consistent in how He dealt with the nations that came against His people and His land. He is also consistent in how He destroys and we are told that last time it was with water but when He returns this time&#8230;its going to be with fire.</span> <span style=\"color:#000000;\">And while He is perfectly capable of cleaning up a nuclear mess made by men, it is the footstool of His Glorious Throne.</span> </p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"color:#003366;\"><span class=\"reftext\"><a href=\"http://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-14.htm\"><span style=\"color:#003366;\">14</span></a></span><span class=\"highl\">&#8220;Behold, they have become like stubble, Fire burns them; They cannot deliver themselves from the power of the flame; There will be no coal to warm by Nor a fire to sit before!</span> <span class=\"reftext\"><a href=\"http://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-15.htm\"><span style=\"color:#003366;\">15</span></a></span>&#8220;So have those become to you with whom you have labored, Who have trafficked with you from your youth; Each has wandered in his own way; There is none to save you.

Almost everyone in attendance nodded their heads in agreement; no one contested the historical assumptions implicit in the example. More recently Victoria University ran a slick television campaign stating that in the 14th century most people believed the world was flat. The ad showed a picture of a boat sailing across the sea only to fall over the side of the earth and concluded \u201cIt makes you think.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">It is true that I did learn this story at school and that I have read it in more than one history textbook but because I took the time to research the history of theology when I was at university I know that this story is fiction. It is a slanderous fabrication invented by opponents of Christianity in the 19th century and has been thoroughly debunked by contemporary historians of science.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The definitive study is undoubtedly that of Jeffrey Burton Russell in Inventing the Flat Earth: Columbus and Modern Historians. Russell summarised his findings, in a paper presented to the 1997 American Scientific Affiliation Conference, as follows,</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [W]ith extraordinary few exceptions no educated person in the history of Western Civilization from the third century B.C. onward believed that the earth was flat. A round earth appears at least as early as the sixth century BC with Pythagoras, who was followed by Aristotle, Euclid, and Aristarchus, among others in observing that the earth was a sphere. Although there were a few dissenters\u2014Leukippos and Demokritos for example\u2013by the time of Eratosthenes (3 c. BC), followed by Crates(2 c. BC), Strabo (3 c. BC), and Ptolemy (first c. AD), the sphericity of the earth was accepted by all educated Greeks and Romans.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Nor did this situation change with the advent of Christianity. A few\u2014at least two and at most five\u2014early Christian fathers denied the spherically of earth by mistakenly taking passages such as Ps. 104:2-3 as geographical rather than metaphorical statements. On the other side tens of thousands of Christian theologians, poets, artists, and scientists took the spherical view throughout the early, medieval, and modern church. The point is that no educated person believed otherwise.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Russell traced the story about Columbus and medieval flat-earthers back to the 19th century; it originated in a fictional novel by Washington Irving The Life and Voyages of Christopher Columbus I (1829). Later it was picked up by two influential books, John Draper\u2019s History of the Conflict between Religion and Science (1874) and Andrew Dickson White\u2019s book A History of The Warfare Between Science and Theology in Christendom. These books famously used the Columbus story plus many others to defend the thesis that the Church, for centuries, suppressed science and worked to prevent its flourishing; this is known as the conflict thesis.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">These books and the conflict thesis they spawned, are highly influential in popular science and media coverage of theological and scientific issues today despite most historians rejecting them as propaganda. In The Encyclopedia of the History of Science and Religion, Collin Russell notes,</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Draper takes such liberty with history, perpetuating legends as fact that he is rightly avoided today in serious historical study. The same is nearly as true of White, though his prominent apparatus of prolific footnotes may create a misleading impression of meticulous scholarship.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Steven Shapin wrote in the same vein in The Scientific Revolution,</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the late Victorian period it was common to write about the \u201cwarfare between science and religion\u201d and to presume that the two bodies of culture must always have been in conflict. However, it is a very long time since these attitudes have been held by historians of science.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Numerous other specialists in the field of the history of science and religion concur that the existence of medieval flat-earthers is a myth. Numbers and Lindberg noted in a journal article, \u201cthere was scarcely a Christian scholar of the Middle Ages who did not acknowledge [Earth's] sphericity and even know its approximate circumference.\u201d In his study of medieval cosmology, God and Reason in the Middle Ages, distinguished historian Edward Grant noted that,</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All medieval students who attended a university knew this. In fact any educated person in the Middle Ages knew the earth was spherical, or of a round shape. Medieval commentators on Aristotle\u2019s \u201cOn the Heavens\u201d or in the commentaries on a popular thirteenth century work titled \u201cTreatise on the Sphere\u201d by John of Sacrobosco, usually included a question in which they enquired \u201cwhether the whole earth is spherical\u201d. Scholastics answered this question unanimously: The earth is spherical or round. No university trained author ever thought it was flat.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Draper\u2019s and White\u2019s books remain widely cited despite being debunked as historically inaccurate. In fact, the kinds of textbooks Katie mentioned have been subject to scathing criticism precisely for making the aforementioned claims. Lawrence S. Lerner, a professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at California State University who is a member of the panel that wrote the 1990 framework for science education in California\u2019s public schools criticised Pretence Halls history text denouncing it as \u201cignorant fakery.\u201d In an article entitled \u201cFake \u2018History\u2019 That Is Flatly Wrong,\u201d Lerner described the flat-earth claims as a \u201cpopular piece of pseudo historical folklore\u201d he added that it \u201cremains popular today among people who have had little education. These evidently include the people who produce \u2018science\u2019 books for Prentice Hall.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The historical facts are difficult to dispute. During the, so called, \u201cdark ages\u201d Boethius (480-525) cited a well known and accepted ancient Greek cosmological model that affirmed the sphericity of the earth in the Consolidation of Philosophy. Isidore of Serville (560-636) affirmed a round earth in the Etymologies. Bede (672-735) in The Reckoning of Time taught the earth was round; as did Rabanus Marcus in the ninth century.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The late middle-ages are no different. Hemannus Contractus (1013-155) measured the circumference of the world. Hildegard of Bingen (1098-1179) taught the world was round as did John of Sacrbosco (1200-1256) and Peire d\u2019Ailly (1350-1420). Dante\u2019s Divine Comedy portrays the earth as a sphere. In the Summa Theologicae Thomas Aquinas wrote,</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The physicist proves the earth to be round by one means, the astronomer by another: for the latter proves this by means of mathematics, e.g. by the shapes of eclipses, or something of the sort; while the former proves it by means of physics, e.g. by the movement of heavy bodies towards the center, and so forth.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Even medieval textbooks taught the world was round. Both the Elucidarium of Honorius Augustodunensis, a twelfth century manual for educating clergy, and On the Sphere of the World, the standard cosmological textbook of medieval universities in the 13th century, taught that the world was round.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">As I have delved into religious history further I have found that this had not been the first or only instance where I was fed false propaganda about Christianity. I could document several other false versions of history; the flat-earth story will suffice for now.

The question comes following the discovery of the carcass of a rare 18-foot-long oarfish off the coast of Catalina Island on Oct. 13, followed by another snakelike 14-foot-long oarfish found on Oct. 18 in Oceanside. Fishermen in Japan reported a sharp uptick in oarfish sightings in March 2010 following the massive magnitude-8.8 earthquake in Chile that same month, which marked almost exactly one year before the country was devastated by its own magnitude-8.9 quake in northeast Japan. Oarfish, which can grow to more than 50 feet in length, are considered the longest bony fish in the world. They typically dive more than 3,000 feet deep, which makes sightings rare and has fueled various serpent legends throughout history. According to traditional Japanese lore, oarfish rise to the water\u2019s surface and beach themselves to warn of an impending earthquake, a notion that some scientists have speculated could be supported by the bottom-dwelling fish being more sensitive to seismic shifts.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Known as the \u201cMessenger from the Sea God\u2019s Palace,\u201d over a dozen \u201cryugu no tsukai,\u201d or slender oarfish, either washed ashore or were caught in fishing nets in the Ishikawa, Toyama, Kyoto, Shimane and Nagasaki prefectures near the quake\u2019s epicenter months before the 2011 quake hit, according to several reports. Scientists, however, say there is no data to support an actual link between the two phenomena. \u201cIt\u2019s probably just a coincidence,\u201d said Rick Feeney, who has been studying fish for almost 35 years for the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. According to Feeney, four sightings have been reported since 2010 from the Central Coast southward, including in Malibu in 2010 and Lompoc in 2011. \u201cWe think that they come inshore to die actually because they\u2019re in distress for some reason, but we don\u2019t know what the reason is,\u201d said Feeney, adding that the fish could have been starving or disoriented.

Medina is about 210 miles north of Mecca,the holiest city of Islam. Mecca and Madinah are so holy that only Muslims are allowed to step foot in them.</p>\n<p> Imagine&#8230;the officials there at first thought they only had the swine flu to deal with this year as pilgrims the world over begin to flood the areas. But now there is the threat of earthquakes and eruptions during this most holy season for them.</p>\n<p> When I began building this thread&#8230;.I did a lot of work on the northern areas of Israel and Arabia.</p>\n<p> For one as according to prophecy its from the north that the Assyrian comes, 2 if you gonna attack Jerusalem&#8230;due to geography you have to attack from the north if you plan on an invasion of occupation&#8230;.3 its the most studied?<br /> Its where most info can be found for what ever reason.</p>\n<p> There is some research here on the southern areas from (dead sea to red sea) but its slim cause 1. its a very disputed area and 2. you have the cultural and language barriers and the 2 will never come together until the Lords return&#8230;and 3. I just figured they were ignorant about this vast area due to its hostile climate and vastness of it.</p>\n<p> I thought there was no info on the area cause people weren&#8217;t interested and those who were, weren&#8217;t allowed in the areas&#8230;much like archeologists are policed in Egypt&#8230;its an expensive venture and one wrong move or word would have you sent packing. All this of course due to the Arab Israeli conflict.</p>\n<p> Then the Saudi press began talking about these quakes and lava flows occurring north of Medina. And I suddenly realized that the Lord had blinded me to something&#8230;.something very important about the geological make up as well as the prophecy about the area. And it could only have been the Lord blinding me cause the importance of all this was right in front of, not only mine&#8230;but everyone&#8217;s eyes.</p>\n<p> The importance was as easy to see as looking at a map&#8230;.of which I have viewed and posted plenty and of which&#8230;.I looked at once more the other day when the light finally went on.</p>\n<p> The Saudi&#8217;s aren&#8217;t ignorant of the area&#8230;.in fact they are as learned of that area as the Egyptians are of their archeological sites.</p>\n<p> If not more so&#8230;..because its the area of Mecca and Medina.</p>\n<p> In fact, their preachers use this area to proselytize especially Israeli&#8217;s and Christians even&#8230;.with our own OT.</p>\n<p> They preach that the Messiah will come from that area&#8230;&#8230;.</p>\n<p> Hab 3:3<br /> God came from Teman, and the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah. His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise.</p>\n<p> Hab 3:4 And his brightness was as the light; he had horns coming out of his hand: and there was the hiding of his power.</p>\n<p> But just like every other deceiver&#8230;&#8230;..they take this bit of information out of context and rely upon the potential converts ignorance of Gods word. Cause when you look at the verses above and below the 2 used by them&#8230;..you see that indeed He is coming from there for the salvation of His own. But He is walking thru that area in His wrath&#8230;.</p>\n<p> Hab 3:5<br /> Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth at his feet.</p>\n<p> Hab 3:6<br /> He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld, and drove asunder the nations; and the everlasting mountains were scattered, the perpetual hills did bow: his ways are everlasting.</p>\n<p> Hab 3:7<br /> I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction: and the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.</p>\n<p> Interesting eh?</p>\n<p> And even more so when you stop to realize that at this very moment the Saudi officials are worrying over pestilence and burning coals of fire during their most holy season&#8230;..Umrah which peaks at Ramadan&#8230;.a time in which this whole area will be packed to over flowing with worshipers of allah. Worshipers of allah that are required to make that pilgrimage at least once in their life.</p>\n<p> Now&#8230;.imagine this scenario&#8230;.the areas of Medina and mecca destroyed by quakes and volcanism.

This summer, the Midwest experienced a cold wave referred to as \u00a0\u201cJulytober\u201d following the June eruption of Mount Sheveluch in Russia. Experts continue to compare this eruption to others from history and debate whether it could have induced the cooler Midwestern weather. \u201cLarge Russian volcano eruptions tend to cool the Midwest,\u201d Historical Climatologist Evelyn Browning-Garriss said. When a volcano erupts, if it is large enough, it can send debris miles into the stratosphere. The stratosphere is the atmosphere above where weather takes place, approximately 6-8 miles off the ground. \u201cSulfur dioxide combines with water in the atmosphere to provide sulfuric acid aerosol droplets that reflect incoming solar radiation,\u201d PhD Research Geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey Alaska Volcano Observatory David Schneider said.Although the eruption of Mount Sheveluch in June was minor compared to\u2026</h5>\n</div><p class=\"reblog-source\"><a href=\"http://theextinctionprotocol.wordpress.com/2013/09/02/did-a-volcanic-eruption-induce-the-summer-cooling-spell/\">View original</a> <span class=\"more-words\">141 more words</span></p></div></div>", "post_id": 443, "location": false, "date": "12-07-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}], "edges": [{"data": [0, 0], "type": "comment", "service": "wordpress"}, {"data": [27933907, 14867804, 14867804], "type": "like", "service": "wordpress"}], "metadata": {"services": [{"username": "ammi2", "display_name": "ammi2", "service": "wordpress", "service_url": "https://wordpress.com/", "location": false, "service_id": 21572636, "profile_url": "http://en.gravatar.com/ammi2"}]}}

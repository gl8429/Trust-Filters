I have many goals. Most of them have to do with getting the world to become a more knowledge-filled and healthy place. In my own quest to achieve goals, I have found new ones. To me, a goal is a strong aspiration and inspiration. In the achievement of goals, I tend to find new and exciting other goals. I aspire to achieve and am inspired by achievement. This goes for personal and professional goals. It also goes for those goals I hope to help others achieve. So, what are my goals:</p>\n<p>1. I aspire to get my own body in as best shape as I can. This is a health and physicality goal all in one.</p>\n<p>2. I aspire to be successful in helping others achieve their goals for health and wellness.</p>\n<p>3. I aspire to become a resource for your questions about health and wellness.</p>\n<p>4. I aspire to be successful in hearth and home.</p>\n<p>5. I aspire to gain trust and love in life and career.</p>\n<p>These are simple goals that I may reach soon or I may aspire to always achieve. Each has a subcategory, but I don&#8217;t want to get technical and boring&#8230;so I left it at this basic list.</p>\n<p>So, what are your goals? Can you be specific? Are they short or long-term? How can you help me achieve my goal to help you? Do your goals center around body or mind or both? How do you think you could reach those goals?</p>\n<p>Thanks and have a healthy day!</p>\n<p>Rachel</p>\n", "post_id": 100, "location": false, "date": "03-23-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["he-said", "wellness", "psychiatric disorders", "primal", "epilepsy", "mind", "gi-gl", "livin' la vida low carb", "glycemic index", "depression", "Aspartame", "paleo", "low-GI", "what people say", "vegetables", "bipolar disorder", "sugar", "leafy green veggies", "low-GL", "Fructose", "health", "grass-fed meats", "body", "nutrition", "ketosis", "mind-body connection", "whole foods", "low-carb", "caveman diet", "manic depression", "she-said", "angelo coppola", "ketogenic diet", "this week in paleo", "lifestyle", "health and wellness", "jimmy moore", "processed foods", "fitness", "Diabetes", "mental disorders", "latest in paleo"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://alternefit.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/hesaidshesaid-copy.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-105\" title=\"hesaidshesaid copy\" src=\"https://alternefit.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/hesaidshesaid-copy.jpg?w=300&#038;h=228\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"228\" /></a>I was listening to a podcast on Jimmy Moore&#8217;s &#8220;Livin&#8217; La Vida Low Carb&#8221; today. It was an interview with another one of my favorite podcasters named Angelo Coppola of the former &#8220;This Week in Paleo&#8221; podcast and the now &#8220;Latest in Paleo&#8221; podcast on 5 by 5.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I love listening to both of these guys. Jimmy has some very entertaining interviews on his podcast, and Angelo&#8230;well, Angelo is amazing at really putting the week&#8217;s health and Paleo news into simple-to-understand and entertaining podcasts!</p>\n<p>So, the interview of Angelo by Jimmy was awesome, and it made me think about some of my own personal ideas and challenges with lifestyle changes. Here is what I came up with!</p>\n<p>I thought I would do this in a &#8220;He Said, She Said&#8221; manner&#8230;because, well, that is actually similar to how it went down!</p>\n<p>He said: &#8220;So you are going to just eat like a caveman?&#8221;</p>\n<p>She said: &#8220;Well, yes, as much as I can.&#8221; (Plain and simple, that means whole foods as often as I can, including things like grass-fed animal products, saturated fats, leafy green vegetables, some nuts and berries, and no processed foods or artificial sweeteners. Limits on the fruits. No HFCS).</p>\n<p>He said: &#8220;All the stuff I eat tastes good, and all the stuff you eat is gross&#8221;</p>\n<p>She said: &#8220;You are under the impression that healthy whole foods taste bad, but really, more times than not, people taste a well-cooked meal of whole foods and they love it. Just because it has been something you haven&#8217;t eaten in the past or have thought was gross, does not mean it really is. You just have to either not know what it is or taste it cooked in an awesome manner.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He said: &#8220;Yeah, but those things are goooood (those things are high-carb, processed foods such as cereal or sugary foods and beverages like candy, desserts,\u00a0or sweet tea).&#8221;</p>\n<p>She said: &#8220;Well, of course they are. They are addictive. Any addict will tell you that the drug of choice is goooood. I am not denying they have tasted good to me in the past, but I am not craving that anymore for a reason. I stopped eating it and feel great. It doesn&#8217;t even interest me. There are some treats I prefer now that do not contain fructose, sugar, or added chemicals. They are natural, sweet, and yummy. Besides, you can substitute. I have no problem with some low-carb, stevia sweetened things. They taste better to me and make me feel 100% better than being addicted to crap.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He said: &#8220;I wish they would change the food labels to tell you the Glycemic Load/Glycemic Index instead of just putting the calories and other things. I mean, why is it that you can eat something like bread and it has no sugar but it makes the blood sugar go up still?&#8221;</p>\n<p>She said: &#8220;Because carbs are essentially sugar in your system. The more refined it is, the higher the spike. The more carbs, the higher the spike.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He said: &#8220;What exactly is a carb? Why is it so bad for diabetics?&#8221;</p>\n<p>She said: &#8220;That&#8217;s complicated. Essentially, carbs are a form of macronutrient fuel your body can use&#8230;especially the brain; however, your body can produce them to run off of fat. In today&#8217;s society, we get carb-overload. We eat way too many refined carbs, so our bodies choose to use that first and store everything else. Hence, well, we get fat and diabetic. Well, that&#8217;s at least a small piece of it, to my understanding.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He said: &#8220;Basically, our brains use carbs that we already produce. Today, we eat way too many carbs and our bodies can&#8217;t handle it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>His friend said: I don&#8217;t know&#8230;I didn&#8217;t hear the response&#8230;sorry!</p>\n<p>He said: &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe you are eating beef now!&#8221;</p>\n<p>She said: &#8220;Only grass-fed. I don&#8217;t want to test the corn-fed, processed crap if I can help it!&#8221;</p>\n<p>He said: &#8220;I have cut out cereal, which I love and have always eaten! I have cut out bread!&#8221;</p>\n<p>She said: &#8220;He is soooooo amazing! He really does understand! He is the most amazing guy in the world&#8230;who else would go to such lengths!&#8221;</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoyed this! Bob, I love you!!!! I truly mean you are amazing!</p>\n<p>These were my thoughts, brought up by those two cool podcasters I mentioned earlier. They were discussing whether or not it is good for the Paleo community to be related to &#8220;the caveman.&#8221; My point to that is that it gets the conversation going, and there is no shame in saying you eat real food, not processed crap&#8230;so yeah&#8230;I eat like a caveman and I&#8217;m proud of it! Bet I&#8217;m healthier in body and mind for it too! (oh, and a great side-effect: the awesome physique!)</p>\n<p>Thanks and have a healthy day!</p>\n<p>Rachel</p>\n<p>OH, OH! And stick around the blog for a very personal post about the idea that a ketogenic (low-carb, paleo&#8230;often) diet and how this might affect bipolar disorder! I&#8217;m finding some very interesting and controversial stuff on this! I already know that there are highly effective holistic and herbal treatments for this mental disorder&#8230;but there may even be some suggestions that the same ketogenic diets that work on epilepsy can work on bipolar&#8230;hmmmm&#8230;interesting!</p>\n", "post_id": 104, "location": false, "date": "03-24-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Thyroid", "paleo", "T2DM", "lifestyle", "Testosterone", "fat loss", "Metabolic", "Endocrine System", "primal", "wellness", "Leptin", "diet", "Progesterone", "health", "Insulin", "Hormones", "adrenal", "Diabetes", "metabolism", "Estrogen"], "text": "<p>Hi Everyone,</p>\n<p>This post might be kind of confusing, but I wanted to see if I could attempt to help you all understand a very important part of body regulation for fat loss and health.</p>\n<p>This post is about a hormone called leptin. This little guy is so important in how the endocrine system functions (or doesn&#8217;t function). It is tied to other hormones&#8230;like insulin, testosterone, progesterone, and estrogen. It is also tied to the adrenals and thyroid (these last two many people often tout as reasons for being overweight and not feeling they can lose it&#8230;aha! Get the leptin under control, and maybe these will function better&#8230;and then the fat will start to dissipate! The system will start to work!)</p>\n<p>Leptin is found in the fat cells of the body. It functions as a somewhat pro-\u00a0inflammatory cell-signaling protein molecule (cytokine). It is also known as the fat sensing hormone (Gedgaudas, 2010). Leptin speaks to the hypothalamus.</p>\n<p>Now, leptin is similar to insulin&#8230;so, the same things that mess with insulin also mess with leptin (Gedgaudas, 2010). The two can function well in similar manners, but they can also disfunction in similar manners. The main thing that seems to make both of these two hormones disfunction? Blood sugar surges (Gedgaudas, 2010).</p>\n<p>After some time, when there are a bunch of fluctuations in blood sugar, the insulin and the leptin both tend to stop functioning properly; hence, the hypothalamus does not get a needed message. What is that message? Well, since leptin says to either burn or not burn, store or not store energy or fat, the message that won&#8217;t be sent if this becomes disfunctional is that burn now message. This is leptin resistance. Similar to insulin resistance (see previous post about insulin resistance). If you can regulate the leptin by limiting carbs, and keep them optimally low (not really low), you may well be in an optimal fat burning state.</p>\n<p>Some signs that you may have some leptin resistance or disfunction:</p>\n<p>1. Love handles</p>\n<p>2. Lethargy after meals</p>\n<p>3. Overweight</p>\n<p>4. Cravings for comfort foods</p>\n<p>5. Stress and anxiety</p>\n<p>(Gedgaudas, 2010)</p>\n<p>Pretty interesting, right?</p>\n<p>Keeping carbs down will not create those blood sugar fluctuations, and eating enough good fat will help leptin function properly too.</p>\n<p>Generally, if leptin is disregulated, insulin will be as well. You might even have other malfunctions within the body&#8230;like lowered desire to procreate or thyroid and adrenal malfunctions (as mentioned earlier)! Do you see why this hormone is so important?</p>\n<p>Hormones work and don&#8217;t work together, and leptin is the dietary fat sensor! It sees how much fat is available in the diet and tells the brain what to do. If it is not working properly, appetite will be skewed and no weight will be lost&#8230;sooooo, what to do?</p>\n<p>Eat less carbs to get your leptin under control. Eat less (preferably no) sugar to keep your leptin under control!</p>\n<p>What kinds of things should you cut out?</p>\n<p>Sweets</p>\n<p>Breads</p>\n<p>Grains</p>\n<p>Fruits (except maybe some berries or occasional piece of organic fruit&#8230;unless you are going to be doing some serious high-intensity working out)</p>\n<p>Legumes</p>\n<p>Potatoes</p>\n<p>Cereals</p>\n<p>Cut these out and you should be on your way to healthy leptin, a healthy endocrine system, and a healthier you!!!!</p>\n<p>Oh yeah, and one more thing&#8230;if leptin affects so many parts of the system, how do you think it might affect certain disorders and diseases&#8230;getting it under control very well could be the answer to many various issues! Such as what? Such as</p>\n<p>1. Diabetes Type II</p>\n<p>2. Obesity</p>\n<p>3. Sexual dysfunctions</p>\n<p>3. Some mental disorders (anxiety, depression)</p>\n<p>4. Hyperglycemia</p>\n<p>5. Hypoglycemia</p>\n<p>and so much more!</p>\n<p>Of course, this is a hypothesis&#8230;a theory&#8230;but think about it!</p>\n<p>Thanks and have a healthy day!</p>\n<p>Rachel</p>\n<p>A side note: I want to make sure you all understand that it is important to eat a good amount of SATURATED (animal, mostly) FATS while keeping CARBS low so that you have the proper propotion of energy to fuel the body! Leptin listens to this!</p>\n<p>Gedgaudas, N.

post on the idea that grains were not used by our Paleolithic ancestors; however, that is a really difficult avenue to track down scientifically. I mean, really, the fact is that there is little evidence available to us today that would tell us exactly what humans ate 100,000 years ago or less.</p>\n<p>Most Paleo, Primal, and Low-carb advocates would tell you that the small bits of evidence we have on the Paleolithic diet would show little to no grain/starchy foods. Of course, this is not the only idea out there in the world of nutrition.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong&#8230;I do not believe that Paleolithic man ate many (if any) grains. I think that grains are a more modern food-substance invention. I think that it would have been very difficult to cultivate and process grains, and our cave-man ancestors probably did not do this with their crude tools or sparse time. I think that the majority of the Paleolithic world focused on hunting and gathering. This most likely means that our cave-man and woman ancestors would have eaten a lot of meat, maybe some nuts, seeds, and berries, and fish. Depending on the area these people lived in, the diet would have varied (as it really should do now, but does not).</p>\n<p>Here is what I have found to be the best timeline of grain domestication in human history:</p>\n<p>Grains: wheat, rye,barley, rice, oats, corn, sorghum, millet (Harlan cited in Cordain, 1999).</p>\n<p>Wheat and barley domesticated approximately 10,000 years ago in the Near East(Cordain, 1999).</p>\n<p>Rice domesticated approximately 7,000 years ago in China, India, and Asia\u00a0(Cordain, 1999).</p>\n<p>Corn domesticated approximately 7,000 years ago in Central and South America (Cordain, 1999).</p>\n<p>Millet domesticated approximately 5,000 or 6,000 years ago in Africa (Cordain, 1999).</p>\n<p>Rye domesticated approximately 5,000 years ago in southwest Asia (Cordain, 1999).</p>\n<p>Oats domesticated approximately 3,000 years ago in Europe.</p>\n<p>Sorghum* domesticated approximately 5,000 or 6,000 years ago in East Africa.</p>\n<p>The reason I put the * next to sorghum is because I did find an article at University of Canada citing an archeological dig in Mozambique that was supposedly dated to 100,000 years ago. The dig found sorghum on ancient tools, and this led to speculation that the grain was ground and consumed.</p>\n<p>In a press release for University of Calgary news, it is stated that the archaeologist and head of the Canada Research Chair in Tropical Archaeology, Julio Mercado unearthed stone tools with bits of wild sorghum, wine palm, pigeon peas, the false banana, wild oranges, and a tuber on them (University of Calgary, 2009). Of course, these plant and wild food remains are not domesticated grains and foods as we have today. They may not have even been used as food. There is no evidence that the diets of the &#8220;cave-man or woman&#8221; consisted of any one grain. Of course, found in a cave, these could have been used for food or art or a number of other things.</p>\n<p>In any case, if you just do an internet search for &#8220;when did humans start consuming grains,&#8221; you will come up with some interesting results; the least of which will tell you that research and theory have ultimately come to the conclusion that the grains we are urged to eat a ton of by the USDA (United States DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE&#8230;not a really good source for the public&#8217;s best nutrition information if you ask me) might be slight relatives of ancient wild grains&#8230;but they are CHANGED&#8230;DOMESTICATED&#8230;and HIGHLY PROCESSED!</p>\n<p>So, what is the point? Well, in my opinion (and that of many other nutrition experts&#8230;not RDs, they are paid to continue that crazy stuff they learned in conventional dietary and medical schools), grains are not really meant for humans to consume safely. They play tricks on the body. They contain products that are not good for our systems unless they go through major processing to &#8220;fix&#8221; them. So, why do we eat them? Why are we told they are healthy? In actuality, we survived hundreds of thousands of years without grains&#8230;and we were more healthy (by we, I mean humans&#8230;our ancestors).</p>\n<p>Anyway, this post is getting a bit long. I like to keep them relatively short and sweet because I understand the attention span can sometimes drift. Mine ultimately does at times. I happen to like researching this stuff, though, so I can take a bit more. Anyway, I wanted to bring this to the attention of as many of you as would hang with me. In the future, I am going to try to post more information about this topic. I will also try to get a visual aid up, so that you might understand some of it a bit better. For now, I will leave you with the thought that if we survived for hundreds of thousands of years without the trouble and issues grains bring, why should we consume them now?</p>\n<p>Until next time!</p>\n<p>Have a healthy day!</p>\n<p>Rachel</p>\n<p>In any case, most of the science and nutrition world understand that domesticated grains did not become a part of diet for most humans for hundreds of thousands of years.</p>\n<p>References</p>\n<p>Cordain, L.

Notice this statement says nothing about them eating grains, potatoes, or legumes (let alone sugar, processed foods, or high fructose corn syrup)? There is a reason for that&#8230;they did not eat these things 333 generations ago. Why is that important to us? Well, because we are still genetically programmed to eat the same as these ancestors from 333 generations ago! Believe it or not, it takes about 40,000 years or so to really change DNA a great deal&#8230;in fact, our own human DNA has changed very little in this time (Cordain, 2011).</p>\n<p>Anywho&#8230;essentially, I am saying that it takes a really long time to change what we are adapted well to eating and that means it also takes a long time to be healthy eating in any other way than how we are programmed to eat&#8230;get it?</p>\n<p>This is the logic of biology and history coming to us at full speed. Look, currently there are a large number of Americans (and now other countries&#8217; citizens) that eat chemicals instead of food. Have you ever really read the package you pick up in the frozen foods isle of your grocery store? Look at how long the list is. Even just those things from some delis in the stores are gigantic lists! What are all those things? Those are chemicals and food-like substances. Those are NOT food! If you want food&#8230;real sustenance&#8230;you must really be willing to buy fresh and cook. An example: I am currently making chicken jerky. I am drying it in my oven at home&#8230;on a very, very, very low heat in my oven. I seasoned it with some various seasonings and have been cooking it in the oven at 150 degrees for 2 hours now. It is a way I can be sure that my food will consist of exactly what I want it to consist of!</p>\n<p>Well, on that note, I am going to keep this short. I need to get to some other work at this point. Stay tuned for my next podcast (which I hope to record tomorrow). I am going to talk about some of the stuff I have read and learned as well as give some recipes I have found to be tasty!

It is the carbohydrate and sugar in the diet that really causes problems. In several recent articles, researchers and nutritionists have stated that eliminating sugar, potatoes, breads, pasta, and rice will really wipe out most cases of obesity, overweight, and metabolic syndromes. It may also lead to the reversal or removal of many other diseases, disorders, and issues humans tend to have.</p>\n<p>None of this is new science, either. In centuries past the idea was to eat a healthy diet rich in saturated fats and low in carbohydrates to maintain health. This all turned around with the industrial revolution. The inventions of machines that made processing things easy or easier had a lot to do with how things were marketed. This also had a lot to do with the way science was handled&#8230;that is as far as research and reporting went. When Ancel Keys did his Seven Countries Study&#8230;well, let&#8217;s just say it was poor reporting&#8230;the study may not have been that great either. Here are some issues:</p>\n<p>The study was not really of just 7 countries&#8230;it was of <strong>22</strong> countries! What happened there? Well, the man had a hypothesis and set out to prove it right&#8230;rather than to see if he was right or wrong (bad science). His hypothesis did not match the results&#8230;so he essentially manipulated it by choosing 7 of the countries in a line that would show his theory in the way he hypothesized. It may not have been manipulated with ill intentions&#8230;but it did have ill results. It caused us humans to believe that saturated fat was bad for us, that it would raise cholesterol and do damage. It got us onto the low-fat roller coaster we are still trying to get off of today! The fact is being once again proven that FAT DOES NOT MAKE US FAT!</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t believe me?

Admittedly, these terms can get quite confusing, and it can get quite frustrating to understand what is the best advice to listen to or try. In my own opinion, and in the opinions of many others in the world of healthy lifestyle, the best advice I have heard is to listen to the body and understand what it is saying. This can also be confusing, though, because many times what we think our bodies are saying is really the opposite.</p>\n<p>Let me first explain what that last sentence means:</p>\n<p>When you crave something, it could either mean you are lacking the nutrients in that food, or it could mean that your body is very hungry and wants a source of fast energy and nourishment. Oftentimes, when the latter is the case, the foods we crave are the exact foods we should stay away from.</p>\n<p>An example of this would be not eating all day long, only to get into the eveningtime to be absolutely famished. This kicks off a craving for fast, easy-to-get, and quick foods. That might lead to a fast food craving. Whereas you might have originally cooked up some nice meal at home like a steak and salad, when this craving from hunger signals kicks in, you end up grabbing a processed, carb-laden, nutrient-lacking pre-cooked burger on a carby bun, some heavily fried (in toxic vegetable oil), starchy french fries, and a sugary or chemically created diet soda. This meal is dangerous in so many ways&#8230;but it might be what you feel the body was craving. Unfortunately, this is one of the things that\u00a0happens in starvation&#8230;why? Well, it is because the body is craving the nutrients and energy it needs to survive. It is sending signals that say &#8220;Hey, I am going into survival mode. I need nourishment to keep up my energy&#8230;and I need that quick source of it NOW!&#8221; This is a process that we have due to years past when times called for eating whatever was necessary in order to truly survive. This is not the case anymore. Today, there are numerous choices for us to do for meals. We no longer need to go hunt or gather for our foods. We now have many options&#8230;so why not pick the very best ones&#8230;no matter what the body in its primitive state is calling for. I assure you, your body will thank you if you do choose to pass on that terrible choice and go for the real, nutrient-rich meal that nourishes the whole body and mind!</p>\n<p>So, with that said, let us go over the various confusing &#8220;diet&#8221; terms out there to determine which might be the best choice for each of us!</p>\n<p>The common knowledge way of thinking\u00a0 has been pushed over and over since around the end of World War II, and really got under way with the McGovern report wrongly singling out saturated fat as a cause for heart disease rates rising in the 1970s (Bowden, 2010). This way of thinking is known as &#8220;low-fat.&#8221; Unfortunately, the McGovern report was based on bad science and incorrect ideas. The money behind all of this really pushed it through government and into the public&#8230;causing even more problems! Big manufacturers began to produce processed foods that had natural fats taken out and strange chemical or industrial ingredients put in in the place of those good fats. They came up with processes that would lower fat but increase dangerous carbohydrates and things that should not be considered food. Processed, garbage food had begun&#8230;and it sticks around today, causing us much harm&#8230;not only from the strange &#8220;ingredients&#8221; that are not natural foods from the earth; but rather, creations of labs and chemists! This is low-fat and no-fat! If you take out the natural, good-for-you, saturated fats&#8230;you get crap&#8230;plain and simple&#8230;you get cardboard that needs flavor&#8230;so sugar is put in, chemicals are added, and other things the body cannot utilize are added&#8230;.you get no nutritional value!</p>\n<p>Obviously, low and no-fat are not good choices to be healthy&#8230;they have essentially created the obesity epidemic and other health issues we deal with in abundance today.</p>\n<p>Now, what about the terms we have heard about since around the 1980s or so? These might include &#8220;low-carb&#8221; or &#8220;Atkins.&#8221; Essentially, these two terms are synonymous with one another. They both mean that the person living this lifestyle is cutting back on the carbohydrates he or she is eating. Basically, Dr. Robert Atkins really got this popularized with his reports and writings in 1972. His book, &#8220;Dr. Atkins&#8217; Diet Revolution&#8221; made a splash, and was revised later on. There is a long and controversial history about this&#8230;but I want to make sure you understand NOT to believe the hooey that some sources tell you. Dr. Atkins&#8217; diet did NOT promote using hydrogenated vegetable oils or other types of created oils; rather, it promoted the replacement of these commonly used oils (because of that low-fat diet thing) with fats such as that from animals. The key is that Atkins reduces the carbohydrates (such as potatoes, breads, rice, and pastas) that are refined and not good for the body&#8230;and it increases the use of saturated fats (like lard, coconut oil, and olive oil). These types of fat will satisfy the person and help to switch the body into fat burning mode.</p>\n<p>Of course, there are several varieties of low-carb type lifestyles or diets. Included in these are the &#8220;Zone Diet,&#8221; &#8220;South Beach Diet,&#8221; and the father of the low-carb diets &#8220;Banting&#8221; (not really a named diet, per se, but more often used as a verb&#8230;in the early 1900s, one might have said he or she was &#8220;banting&#8221; if he or she was losing weight by reduction of the carbs). This comes from a guy who, in the 1860s was very obese and lost weight and felt great by the suggestion of reduction of carbohydrates (Hingle, n.d.) (a very cool story that I really recommend you check out sometime).</p>\n<p>So what exactly does the low-carb diet or lifestyle require and do? Well, to answer this let&#8217;s look at Wikipedia&#8217;s entry on it (I admit, I do not like to use Wikipedia as a sole source for information, but sometimes it does have a balanced write-up about things other sources might be biased on&#8230;and I want to keep this piece unbiased and factual). So, to summarize Wikipedia on low-carb:</p>\n<p>Foods high in carbohydrates (bread, pasta, etc) are restricted or replaced with foods containing higher sources of protein and saturated fats (meats, eggs, dairy, etc.). The low-carb diets also include lower-carb vegetables and fruits such as green, leafy veggies and berries. Amounts of carbohydrates allowed vary from program to program and person to person. Sometimes these diets can restrict carbohydrates low enough to produce ketosis (a process by which the body begins to burn fat and produce ketone bodies, rather than trying to burn quick sources such as carbohydrate for energy&#8230; not harmful, by the way). Often, the amounts of carbohydrates counted would be done by looking at the &#8220;net&#8221; carbs, or those carbs indigestible by the body&#8230;like fiber&#8230;a good thing, in my opinion. The example of this would be taking the total carbohydrate count of something like romaine lettuce (approx. 3.5 oz. = 3.29 total carbs) (USDA Nutrient Database, 2010\u00a0) and deducting the amount of fiber (2.1 fiber). That gives you a net carb count of 1.19 grams of net carbs in approx. 3.5 oz of romaine lettuce&#8230;a low-carb net count!</p>\n<p>So anyways, that is essentially low-carb. There is a lot more to it, but it is quite extensive, and I want to keep this as simple as I can for an introduction&#8230;plus, we have more to go over!</p>\n<p>Now, we have discussed low-fat, fat-free, no-fat (all the same&#8230;see above) and low-carb. What&#8217;s next? Ahh, gluten-free&#8230;</p>\n<p>Gluten-free diets are diets that exclude a protein called gluten. This protein is found in grains such as wheat, barley, and rye (Mayo Clinic, 2010). The protein is not like other, positive proteins. In fact, it can really cause inflammation, and some even consider it an antinutrient that these grains use to make the plant inedible. Truly, it has caused many problems in our population. Those with Celiac Disease are affected most by gluten; however, it may well be that a large number of the population, whether or not they have Celiac or test positive for sensitivity to gluten, could be suffering problems due to gluten.</p>\n<p>Recently, gluten-free diets have become more popular. This has resulted in many, many products being (key word here) PRODUCED (production&#8230;process&#8230;processed) that do not contain gluten. Of course, these products are not only more expensive, but they may also contain other ingredients not useful to the body. Just because it is gluten-free, does not mean it is healthy or good for us. For example, if you pick up a box of gluten-free cake mix, it may not contain gluten, but it probably still contains some sort of artificial ingredient or sugar&#8230;not good for the body! While the gluten-free diet may be healthier if done by eating only whole, real foods, it could be potentially deceiving or just not healthy if one relies again on these processed foods. The gluten-free life is a positive step, but it should only be done with the understanding that these processed foods should not be a staple of the diet&#8230;basically, avoid processed and stick with whole, real foods such as meats, veggies, and some fruits&#8230;and you will avoid gluten. Avoiding grains will also help avoid gluten. A low-carb lifestyle may be low-gluten or gluten-free, but a low-gluten or gluten-free lifestyle is not necessarily low-carb.</p>\n<p>Low Glycemic:</p>\n<p>There are two terms in this diet area: Low glycemic index and low glycemic load. The index is essentially the standard of how certain foods affect the blood glucose levels in the body. Glycemic load is the combination of the quality and quantity of these foods in one number. I have to say, there is a really great podcast by Dana Carpender on this that you should listen to in order to understand this better. I don&#8217;t want to confuse you, so I am not going to go into it any more than to say, these can be helpful, but should not be a lifestyle basis, as they can be confusing, confused, and incorrect. Here is an explanation that really, really hits the nail on the head (thanks Dana!): <a href=\"http://holdthetoast.net/node/192\">http://holdthetoast.net/node/192</a></p>\n<p>Now&#8230;calories vs. carbohydrates:</p>\n<p>I am not going into too much detail here because honestly, if you cut carbohydrates you will also cut down the amount of food you eat&#8230;hence, cutting the silly calorie theory.</p>\n<p>I think there is a place for calories, but I think the majority of us have this too wrong. Yes, foods contain calories. No, calories in vs. calories out is not valid&#8230;why? Well, we are not a closed system. That theory only relates to closed systems. There is much, much more to the biochemistry of the body than just thermodynamics. There is also much more to the calorie than just the number someone attaches to it. A calorie is not a calorie when it comes to our bodies and our nutrients. Plain and simple, calories do not matter if they are understood. This might confuse many of you, so let me just say&#8230;don&#8217;t count calories&#8230;it is futile to do this&#8230;and you might end up with calorie obsession or disappointment at not feeling better or losing weight&#8230;depending on what you eat.</p>\n<p>Now that all of that has been said, I recommend you keep in mind not to count anything. Don&#8217;t count calories or carbs. Just eat what mother nature intended us to&#8230;that is, if you can hunt and kill it, pick it, or eat it raw&#8230;go for it! If it has to be processed, take it easy on it! DON&#8217;T\u00a0\u00a0count what you eat. DON&#8217;T\u00a0avoid saturated fats because they will NOT make you fat or give you heart disease&#8230;those are myths perpetrated by money! DO avoid hydrogenated oil (see blog: The Skinny on Fat). DO eat green, leafy veggies, meat, and some fruits. SHOP the PERIMETER of the grocery store, avoiding the bread if that is where the store has put it. If you do pick up something from the center aisles, try only to pick up things with ingredients you understand. DO avoid artificial sweeteners and sugar (see Podcast: All About Sweeteners). Oh, and one more thing, just as you don&#8217;t often believe the hype about many things the media perpetrates or the government spouts, DON&#8217;T believe the hype on low-fat or common-knowledge reports! Why would they perpetrate anything that does not push their agendas and is not backed by money? Diet and nutrition is NO DIFFERENT! Think outside the societal box&#8230;think &#8220;punk rock&#8221;&#8230;think individual! You are an individual, so keep yourself in mind!</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that our ancestors gave us our systems. We are still designed to eat and respond to foods and the environment the ways that they evolved to. It takes a long time for DNA to change and evolve to accept other things&#8230;that time is not here, and that is why we have so many chronic problems these days. Almost everything we suffer from today can be eliminated or healing can be assisted simply by taking in proper nutrients and eliminating or restricting antinutrients that inflame us and stress our bodies! Avoiding those elements we can is one step to getting healthy, losing fat, and gaining shapely, lean bodies!</p>\n<p>I hope this has helped clear up confusion! Let me know if you need assistance. I am going to do a video series to teach people how to shop and what is good to do at restaurants, etc. It is easier than you think! It is tastier than you think! And this type of living is the healthiest way to live!</p>\n<p>Until then, have a healthy day!</p>\n<p>Rachel</p>\n<p>References</p>\n<p>Bowden, J.

Just as I have been promising&#8230;my blog about cancer.</p>\n<p>This one is going to be a compilation of some of the research I have done on cancer. The sources include the Weston A. Price Foundation and other sites that focus on natural health and healing. I think it is important to give you information that might generally assist you in prevention and treatment of cancer, as some people might respond or relate well to different methods while others might like more or less.</p>\n<p>So, without further ado, let&#8217;s learn about cancer treatment and prevention measures!</p>\n<p>There are some nutrients that play roles in protecting against cancer. Most of these nutrients can be found in those great whole foods I have so often talked about. Of course, we should all realize that healthy foods that are real and whole will lead us toward better health overall; however, when it comes to cancer some of these added benefits may not be known.</p>\n<p>Vitamin A is an immune system booster. It helps metabolize minerals and detoxifies the system. Vitamin A also supports the endocrine system.\u00a0 This important nutrient reduces the amount of free-radicals in the body and prevents cholesterol oxidation. Since it does all of this, it is surely a nutrient that would be linked to cancer prevention. You can get vitamin A from cod liver oil, fish, shellfish, liver, egg yolks, butter, and pastured animals. It is best for you to get your vitamin A from foods rather than supplements; however, if you have determined that you need to supplement for some treatment or prevention, I would recommend you use cod liver oil. This is because pill forms of vitamin A are often not the same as what you would get from the above list. Vitamin A could also have a toxicity when not used properly or in conjunction with vitamin D (which helps to minimize possibility of vitamin A toxicity). Cod liver oil has both A and D, and when used in conjunction with a healthy, nutrient rich diet, it can really help. Here are the dosages the Weston A. Price Foundation recommends:</p>\n<p>Children 3 months to 12 years: 1 tsp. high-quality cod liver oil providing 5,000 International Units (IU) per day.</p>\n<p>12 and older: 2 tsp. regular high-quality cod liver oil providing 10,000 IU per day.</p>\n<p>Women who are pregnant and/or nursing: 4 tsp. regular high-quality cod liver oil providing 20,000 IU per day.</p>\n<p>Vitamin C: this is an antioxidant that can prevent free radical damage. You can find vitamin C in fruits, vegetables, and some organ meats. For some dosages of vitamin C supplements, the amounts can really vary. This is because it is based on many mitigating factors such as age, sex, height, weight, smoking habits, etc. RDAs are pretty much minimal to prevent deficiency. Also, Vitamin C can seem to cause some issues if you take too much. Your best bet? Do an n=1 for yourself but just don&#8217;t go crazy with the dosages. Try something like a max of 200 mg (throughout the day, not all at once) to start.</p>\n<p>B Vitamins: Here we are generally talking about Vitamin B6, Vitamin B12, and Vitamin B17. B6 contributes to enzyme function in over 100 enzymes. Many people in today&#8217;s society have B6 deficiencies. In some research studies these deficiencies have been associated with risk of cancer. You can get Vitamin B6 from raw animal foods (raw pastured, grass-fed meat and dairy). Vitamin B6 supplements are also available. The supplemental dosage of B6 would depend on many factors: sex, consumption of protein, age, etc. A great paper on this supplement is located at the Weston A. Price Foundation here: <a href=\"http://westonaprice.org/abcs-of-nutrition/2163-vitamin-b6-the-under-appreciated-vitamin\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://westonaprice.org/abcs-of-nutrition/2163-vitamin-b6-the-under-appreciated-vitamin</a></p>\n<p>B12 Vitamins: Again, there have been links to cancer with vitamin B12 deficiencies. These are only found in animal foods. You can also find them in supplement form. Check here for more: <a href=\"http://westonaprice.org/abcs-of-nutrition/174-vitamin-b12\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://westonaprice.org/abcs-of-nutrition/174-vitamin-b12</a></p>\n<p>B17 Vitamins: This is a B vitamin that will protect against cancer. It is found in nuts and berries.</p>\n<p>Vitamin D: One of the nutrients that most people today are deficient in is Vitamin D. It is unfortunate too, because Vitamin D is very protective against breast and colon cancer. In order to absorb minerals, vitamin D is required. Cod liver oil is a great source of vitamin D. So are lard, shellfish, butterfat, organ meats, grass-fed animals, and egg yolks. Probably the best source of vitamin D comes from the mid-afternoon sun. I know what you are thinking&#8230;&#8221;but we&#8217;ve always been told that exposure to sun can cause skin cancer.&#8221; Well, that is not exactly true. While prolonged exposure can cause burns and risk, a good 15 minutes for pale skinned people up to 2 hours for darker skinned people between the hours of noon and 3pm with no sunblock on can give you enough vitamin D for the day. Personally, this is my favorite way to get my own vitamin D, but I do also take my cod liver oil.</p>\n<p>Vitamin E: This vitamin is another antioxidant. It works at the cellular level. You can get vitamin E in animal fats, butter, and egg yolks.</p>\n<p>Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA): Found in butterfat and grass-fed ruminant animals, CLA is protective against breast cancer.</p>\n<p>Cholesterol: Yes, cholesterol is an antioxidant that protects against free radicals in the cell membranes. It is found in animal foods. Believe it or not, cholesterol is used by every part of the body. You need a good level (not low levels in the blood like the statin makers and pill pushers would have you believe&#8230;but that is a whole other topic we will save for another day).</p>\n<p>Minerals: Minerals are super important for the body. Things like magnesium, selenium, and zinc help the body fight carcinogens. You can get them from animal foods easily. Supplements are also available, but you should get tested and work with a professional if you choose to supplement.</p>\n<p>Saturated fats: Your lungs cannot function without saturated fats&#8230;which are found in animal products. Even though we have been told that these are bad for a long time, this is just not true. In fact, it is the opposite. Saturated fats help to strengthen the immune system.</p>\n<p>Long-chain Fatty Acids: Arachadonic Acid (AA), Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA), and Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA) are all fatty acids that work on the cellular level to fight cancer. You can get these from animal products, cod liver oil, seafood, and organ meats.</p>\n<p>Short- and medium-Chain Fatty Acids: Can be found in coconut oil and in butter. These help grow a strong immune system and assist in communication at the intercellular level.</p>\n<p>COQ10: A supplement I feel is highly under-rated these days. COQ10 (Co-Enzyme Q10) has many benefits. The list of things this does is endless! One thing it does for us is protect us from cancer. It is found in animal foods and supplements.</p>\n<p>Garlic: Another antioxidant, garlic boosts the immune system and seems to protect cells from damage. It may also help reduce the risk of prostate, colon, breast, and ovarian cancer, but this has not been scientifically determined.</p>\n<p>Maca Root: Has been shown to slow down the growth of cancer cells in animals.</p>\n<p>Tumeric: Some studies and research have shown that tumeric may reduce lesions in colon cancer and might have benefits for prostate, lung, breast, and skin tissues as well.</p>\n<p>Ginseng: Some people have seen results in population studies with ginseng. It may lower the risk of lung, lip, mouth, and liver cancers.</p>\n<p>NOW&#8230;for some things that are cancer-promoting. These are also from the Weston A. Price Foundation information. I will give you that link once again at the end of this blog. It is an extremely worth-while website that I recommend you check out! I just can&#8217;t say that enough!</p>\n<p>Processed foods have the following in them. These have been linked to cancer:</p>\n<p>Transfatty acids: Shortenings, margarines, baked goods, snack foods, etc. have been seriously associated with lung and reproductive organ cancer.</p>\n<p>Rancid Fats: Believe it or not, when you buy those vegetable and other cheap hydrogenated oils at the store, they are already generally rancid. The industrial processing makes them that way. This creates free radicals, hence, cancer.</p>\n<p>Omega-6 Fatty Acids: Out of balance with Omega 3 Fatty Acids, Omega 6s contribute to cancer. These fatty acids are needed in small amounts, but we get way too much from the processed and hydrogenated foods in the SAD diet. Our ratio should be 1 or 2: 1 (Omega 3 to Omega 6), but it is currently more like 1:21!</p>\n<p>MSG: Yes, this is why it should be avoided. I used to wonder about this, but found out that there have been studies where MSG was associated with brain cancer! Be warned: Processed food often contains MSG in it even though it may not be listed as MSG in the ingredients! It could be labeled as flavorings, hydrolyzed protein, and more!</p>\n<p>Aspartame: It is a neurotoxin. Let&#8217;s leave it at that (see All About Sweeteners).</p>\n<p>Pesticides: Uggh! These have almost always been associated with a variety of cancer. Pesticides are everywhere&#8230;and getting worse with the GMOs!</p>\n<p>Artificial Hormones for Animals: Confined animals that are industrially raised and fed soy and grains have high levels of hormones. Also, there are tons of phytoestrogens in soy!</p>\n<p>Refined Carbs: Sugar, HFCS, Agave nectar, white flour, grains that are not fermented, and starches are all associated with inflammation and tumor growth. Like I always said, the more of them you avoid the better!</p>\n<p>Well guys and girls, this has been a long one! Sorry if it is too long!</p>\n<p>Have a healthy day!</p>\n<p>Rachel</p>\n<p>References</p>\n<p>Weston A.

How many hours of sleep do you generally get per night?</strong></p>\n<p>7 to 8\u00a0 usually. During the week I go to bed at around 11 pm and I wake up at 7:45 am. During the weekends, I am not so good. I go to bed late, but I still wake up before 11:00 am regardless!</p>\n<p><strong>6. Do you drink soda or diet soda? If so, what kind and how much?</strong></p>\n<p>No&#8230;only an occasional Zevia.

Do you drink water?</strong> <strong>If so, is it filtered, bottled, or tap? How much?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes. I drink bottled water (if it was completely up to me, I&#8217;d drink from an awesome filter&#8230;but it&#8217;s not&#8230;so I drink bottled water). I drink about 4-6 16oz bottles a day.</p>\n<p><strong>8. Do you believe that eating saturated fat will make you fat?</strong></p>\n<p>HECK NO! Eating fat does just the opposite. It is the hydrogenated oils and fake fats that will help make you fat and clog your arteries!</p>\n<p><strong>9.

I think that people should know about truths versus BS for profit and power. What am I talking about? Well, let me tell you&#8230;.</p>\n<p>There was a recent article put out in Diabetes Health by a lady who claims to be a &#8220;diabetes expert.&#8221; Without going into much detail and taking up everyone&#8217;s time, I am just going to link to it and tell you to not be fooled&#8230;she is no expert for sure&#8230;and the article is lame. I did want to bring it up as another side to all of the research that I am about to post that totally contradicts this crazy lacky&#8217;s point of view. I do want to tell you to be warned about the ridiculousness with which many main-stream articles tend to side themselves. I can give you personal experiences from myself, those around me, friends, and experts&#8230;AND I can give you valid research on scientific levels as well as N=1 levels to counteract what is &#8220;alluded to&#8221; by this lady! So, first, read this stupid (sorry, I do think it is lame and stupid&#8230;and I&#8217;m irate about it giving negative and life-threatening advice) article:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.diabeteshealth.com/read/2011/06/28/7199/type-2-diabetes-from-old-dogmas-to-new-realities&#8212;part-2/#commentpost\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.diabeteshealth.com/read/2011/06/28/7199/type-2-diabetes-from-old-dogmas-to-new-realities&#8212;part-2/#commentpost</a></p>\n<p>Now, let me tell you&#8230;Hope Warshaw is dead wrong&#8230;can you pick up the issues? Let me help:</p>\n<p>1. &#8220;Large studies have shown that with loss of five to seven percent of body weight (approximately 10 to 20 pounds) and 150 minutes of physical activity (30 minutes five times a week), people can prevent or delay the progression to type 2&#8230;[sic]&#8230;The reality is that if blood glucose is out of control, it&#8217;s time to progress to blood glucose-lowering medication(s), because it&#8217;s doubtful that weight loss alone will get and keep blood glucose under control. &#8220;</p>\n<p>-FIRST: this states that &#8220;large studies show&#8221; but does not point toward ANY sources to verify this&#8230;a warning should go off in your head saying&#8230;uh, what studies, when, by whom, how, and why&#8230;</p>\n<p>-SECOND: here her response is that medication is the answer: &#8220;it&#8217;s time to progress to blood glucose-lowering medication(s)&#8221;&#8230;uhh, hang on, that should set off alarms! Did our ancestors say this? Did we have these issues just 30 years ago? Do the research and you will find out the answer is NO! Anyone that says MEDICATION IS NECESSARY PERIOD is a person that ABSOTIVELY, POSOLUTELY SHOULD BE QUESTIONED and SKEPTICIZED! To me this is a clear sign of some sort of special interest (here, it being drugs for diabetes&#8230;does she make a profit from this? Most likely&#8230;do the research).</p>\n<p>To continue on:</p>\n<p>&#8221; Today, most experts, including the<strong> American Diabetes Association and American Association of Clinical <a href=\"http://www.diabeteshealth.com/browse/health-care/endocrinology/\">Endocrinologists</a></strong>, agree that people with type 2 should start on a blood glucose-lowering medication that decreases <a href=\"http://www.diabeteshealth.com/browse/complications-and-care/insulin-resistance/\">insulin resistance</a>&#8211;the core problem in type 2&#8211;at diagnosis.&#8221;</p>\n<p>-FIRST: Think about how these two places may make their money&#8230;follow that money..if they tell you to do the correct thing to actually HEAL yourself do you think they would stay in business? Do you think they would have purpose? Their purpose is to line their pocketbooks&#8230;not to help &#8220;cure&#8221; diabetics&#8230;the more they keep you diabetic, the more they can tout themselves, their mission, and the more they can make bank off of you!</p>\n<p>-SECOND: Insulin resistance is not a condition of lack of medication to lower it&#8230;otherwise we may well all have it&#8230;look, it is obviously caused by something happening in the body&#8230;and the body is not made up of a bunch of injected medications and pills&#8230;so we need to get down to the root of what causes the resistance&#8230;and so far, that seems to be inflammation due to poor nutrition and physical practices and advice. So why not fix the root cause instead of just covering up the issue? I&#8217;ll list some studies and other links at the end of this blog that have tended to (throughout the years) provide keys to what helps in that area!</p>\n<p>Continuing on, though:</p>\n<p>&#8221; Nutrition recommendations for people with type 2 diabetes from the <strong>American Diabetes Association</strong> and other health authorities echo the recently unveiled <strong>U.S. 2010 Dietary Guidelines</strong> (1/31/11) for <a href=\"http://www.diabeteshealth.com/browse/food/low-carb/\">carbohydrate</a>: about 45 to 65 percent of calories. (Americans currently eat about 45 to 50 percent of calories as carbohydrate&#8211;not a &#8220;high carb&#8221; intake.)&#8221;</p>\n<p>Oh boy&#8230;this one is a biggie:</p>\n<p>-FIRST: check the source again!</p>\n<p>-SECOND: Who puts out the guidelines?&#8230;the USDA&#8230;do you really think the UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE has a concern in the world about YOUR HEALTH? Hell no! They care about AGRICULTURE! It is their BUSINESS&#8230;in other words&#8230;it is their MONEY MAKER! What is? GRAIN, CORN, BIG PHARMA, BIG AGRIBUSINESS, BIG CHEAP COMMODITY&#8230;it is how they make money&#8230;they bow to the biggest pay-off&#8230;and that is not a healthy public&#8230;that is CORPORATE INTEREST!</p>\n<p>-THIRD: We could argue semantics about what is or is not low-carb all day&#8230;the simple point is that it has been shown that the carb and sugar intake of the SAD and Western style diets are FAAAAR beyond ancestral ranges&#8230;far beyond healthy ranges&#8230;and far beyond what this mystery statistic is claiming (I couldn&#8217;t find a source for this, could you?) Carb intake is important to pay attention to&#8230;there is no such thing as an essential carbohydrate&#8230;our bodies efficiently make this&#8230;plain and simple (and I&#8217;ll provide you with references at the end of this blog)&#8230;but let&#8217;s move on:</p>\n<p>&#8220;Countless research studies do not show long term (greater than six months to a year) benefit of low carb diets on blood glucose, weight control, or blood fats.&#8221;</p>\n<p>-FIRST: Again, we must always ask ourselves what these research studies are, where are they, where do they come from, why were they done, who did them, and where was the funding and integrity&#8230;OHHHHH&#8230;.but wait, there are no sources given for this supposed fact!</p>\n<p>-SECOND: They don&#8217;t? Resources provided at the end of this blog!</p>\n<p>Okay&#8230;but this is getting way too long&#8230;my point is that we should ALWAYS check our facts&#8230;cross our Ts and dot our Is so to speak&#8230;you can read the rest of the article yourself and learn to find the flaws and fallacies&#8230;but I am now going to give credit where credit is due!

Take a look at how nutrition might be connected to your moods!</p></div>\n<p>Hello all,</p>\n<p>As promised, today&#8217;s blog is about how different foods affect our moods (yes, that rhymes well, doesn&#8217;t it!). I have wanted to do this blog for a while now because I have had my own mood issues in the past. Here&#8217;s the thing&#8230;I noticed that when I started changing my lifestyle, my moods changed as well&#8230;and that is a great thing! There is a lot of information out there about various things that might affect our moods, but the one thing I wanted to know is how food affects it. Since nutrition plays such a huge role in what seems like every part of our health, does it play a part in our mental health as well? My answer is a resounding yes!</p>\n<p>Now, there is a lot to handle in this seemingly simple subject, so let&#8217;s break it down just a bit.</p>\n<p>Segment 1:</p>\n<p>Cholesterol is important in every part of the body, including the brain. Since much of the mood has to do with the way things are working in our brains, it only makes sense that cholesterol might play a key role in mood.</p>\n<p>In fact, what most people tend to believe is a good thing may well be doing more harm than good. Other health issues aside, a low cholesterol level may well cause mental harm.</p>\n<p>Depletion of cholesterol could mess up serotonin receptors and transporters (Deans, 2010). It could also cause issues in formation of nerve synapses (Deans, 2010). Lowering cholesterol may also take its toll on other receptors, causing them to misfire (ie: opioid signaling, GABA receptors, and excitatory amino acid transporters&#8230;some technical terms&#8230;but just remember that these things are important to have balance and functionality with) (Deans, 2010). If you want to know more about these various functions in the brain, here is a link to explain it, check out the heading entitled &#8220;Some Key Neurotransmitters at Work&#8221;: <a href=\"http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/brain_basics/know_your_brain.htm#making\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/brain_basics/know_your_brain.htm#making</a>).</p>\n<p>Anyway, lowering cholesterol seems to negatively affect these important brain functions. This, in turn, can be linked to manic episodes, hostility, aggression, impulsivity (is that a word?), and even violent suicide (Deans, 2010). In a number of studies, it was found that people with manic and mixed syndromes had lower cholesterol than those used as controls (Swartz, 1990<a>; Ghaemi et. al, 2000; Atmaca et. al, 2002; Cassidy &amp; Carroll, 2002; Pae et. al, 2004; &amp; Sagud et. al, 2007 cited in </a>Fiedorowicz, Palagummi, Behrendtsen, &amp; Coryell, 2010). It seems there are quite a number of studies showing a true connection of cholesterol to affective disorders. Just as any research might show, there have been some inconsistencies; however, the case in point is that low cholesterol does seem to play a role in some brain misfires or malfunctions that happen in those with affective disorders.</p>\n<p>So what does this mean as far as food? Well, considering we are often told to &#8220;stay away from cholesterol so that you will have low cholesterol&#8221; there is a lot to really think about. I&#8217;m not going to get into the entire paradigm of incorrect information about cholesterol in this blog (believe me, that one is coming soon), but I will say that eating cholesterol does not produce cholesterol in the blood. It also does not necessarily cause heart disease or clogged arteries. If you eat foods that have cholesterol, you will not be harming yourself&#8230;and in fact, you may be helping! Cholesterol is needed&#8230;even for mental health! Eat it, enjoy it, and realize you will be healthier for it!</p>\n<p>Now, with that said, let&#8217;s get into other food-mood issues, shall we?</p>\n<p>Segment 2: Carbohydrates and Mood</p>\n<p>Interestingly enough, there have been a number of studies done on the effects of carbohydrate consumption on mood. These have been done in any number of ways for any number of hypotheses. For all intents and purposes, I am going to briefly delve into them a few at a time.</p>\n<p>I know some of my readers are interested in what seems to be the cycle of depression or mood swings and cravings for things like sweets and starches, which, in turn, leads to negative feelings and maybe more depression. Is this really the case, though? Well, in a way, yes.</p>\n<p>A study on carbohydrate craving and self-medication found some interesting results. The hypothesis was that carb-cravers tend to self-administer carb-rich foods before protein-rich foods in order to get past negative moods, and that these people report uplifted moods shortly after consuming said carbs (Corsica, &amp; Spring, 2008). Unfortunately, this study did not go further with the results. They did not continue to follow-up with the participants hours after ingestion or among days. While it showed uplifted moods within a specified time, it did not follow-up to see if these participants began to crash or feel worse later on. What can we take from this? Well, we can take the idea that some people do truly tend to crave carbs during bouts of depression or lowered moods. Those people may tend to eat carbs to feel better. Of course, from what I have seen, these same people tend to feel worse for the wear later on. There does seem to be a connection between carbohydrates (sweets and starches), their cravings, and self-medication. But what does this mean for our mood?</p>\n<p>To answer this, we have to understand that there are hundreds of thousands of reactions happening in our bodies when we consume different foods. Something that carbohydrates, and in particular&#8230;grains and sugar, do to our systems is stress it out. These foods begin a defense in our brains, guts, and hormones. This raises cortisol levels and may cause weight-gain, lethargy, and other ill effects. All of this going on equals negative effect on mood and health. So, when we eat high carb and high sugar foods, we set ourselves up for a quick high and a big let-down. Our bodies don&#8217;t like this&#8230;it stresses out the system. In order to prevent this, we do need to consider what else might help elevate the mood&#8230;rather than that overwhelming craving for sweet and starch or grains and sugar.</p>\n<p>Enough about that&#8230;this is turning into quite a long blog post. I think I will separate it into two different posts&#8230;easier for you and it allows me to get ready for bed at a reasonable time! <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile' title=':-)'>:-)</span></p>\n<p>But&#8230;before I go&#8230;I want to leave you with some things you can do to boost the mood with food! Here are a few tips&#8230;and the next post will have more!</p>\n<p>Rid yourself of hydrogenated oils and products</p>\n<p>Replace those with real, healthy fats like lard, butter, coconut oil, olive oil, and fatty fish</p>\n<p>Eat animal protein such as meat, raw milk products (occasionally, and only if tolerable), and the like to up your intake of B vitamins</p>\n<p>Add an Omega-3 supplement such as cod liver oil in order to balance the Omega-6-3-9 ratio</p>\n<p>Eat green-leafy vegetables such as spinach and kale or romaine lettuce with lunch and/or dinner in order to help the body remove toxins and anti-nutrients that may contribute to negative mood</p>\n<p>and finally, get out in the sun for Vitamin D! Many experts have stated that sun can help elevate mood&#8230;this may be due to the Vitamin D synthesis that occurs in the body due to direct exposure to sunlight.</p>\n<p>Part 2 is coming next week&#8230;in that, we will discuss more food-mood connections and other ways to boost the mood naturally!</p>\n<p>Thanks and have a healthy day!</p>\n<p>Please check out these references for more info:</p>\n<p>References</p>\n<p>Corsica, J.

Last time I introduced you a bit to how foods can affect mood, and what we can do to correct such issues based on some nutrition. This week, we will go more in depth. Some things we will go over are amino acids, sugar, gluten, food additives, and gut health. Please do keep in mind that this blog (parts 1 and 2) is by no means a complete look at food and how it affects mood. It is a good start, though&#8230;and if you are interested in more, you can go to the various references listed at the ends of part 1 and 2.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s get into it, shall we?</p>\n<p>Amino Acids: Amino acids are molecules that are critical to life and are the building blocks of protein. Some amino acids are even considered precursors to neurotransmitters (Curtin, 2011). They have many functions in metabolism and energy. The central nervous system needs amino acids to function, and the brain needs them to send and receive messages. We all require amino acids in proper levels for each individual in order to function in a healthful manner.\u00a0 Some neurotransmitters include dopamine, serotonin, adrenaline, GABA, norepinephrine, and endorphins. These should be balanced for a healthy mood. Many times, if they are not, we may experience mood swings, shifts, or changes. Since the amino acids are precursors or building blocks of these neurotransmitters, it is essential that we have balanced amino acids too. These amino acids come from protein-rich whole foods. That means we need things like meat, eggs, and some nuts (if you are not sensitive to eggs or nuts&#8230;not peanuts, though&#8230;those are not nuts, they are legumes). Getting good sources of protein will build amino acids in balance, thus affecting mood. Now, I want to also be clear here&#8230;meats in any form (chicken, fish, beef, pork, etc.) should really be those raised on their natural diets&#8230;in other words, you want chicken and their eggs that have been raised as free-range peckers, beef raised on grass and grazing, wild-caught fish, and the like. The conventional types of these products will not be as nutrient-rich, and may even contain things that will affect the balance and health of the animal&#8230;and therefore, the balance and health of you! Of course, I&#8217;m not saying not to eat these conventional things either&#8230;but if you do have the option, you should consider how much healthier the natural diet animals would have been&#8230;and purchase those first!</p>\n<p>So, what happens if amino acids are not in balance? Well, any number of pathways can be affected, hence affecting your mood. You could be depressed, anxious, have cravings, be moody, have attention problems, or just feel cruddy. Since amino acids affect so many neurotransmitters, all you have to do is look at what those transmitters do in psychological terms to know what might happen if the pathways are affected.</p>\n<p>Okay, before we move on, let&#8217;s look at some of the amino acids that are important in this food-mood connection:</p>\n<p><strong>L-tryptophan (5-HTP):</strong> This commonly mentioned amino acid is important in the production of serotonin. Serotonin is the neurotransmitter that seems to control sleep, memory, learning, sexual behavior, appetite control, depression, temperature regulation, anxiety, OCD, schizophrenia, hypertension, obesity, and more (Byrd, 1999). You might see how L-tryptophan levels do have an importance in mood since they affect the serotonin in the body. If you are not eating foods that provide you with good L-tryptophan, you may well be deficient&#8230;thus experiencing problems with mood. Up these whole foods, and you can help up your L-tryptophan:</p>\n<p>Turkey, tuna, other fish, beef, pork, eggs, chicken, sesame seeds, hazelnuts, and cottage cheese. Now, keep in mind your food sensitivities&#8230;and eat whole foods of this kind with that in mind, and you may find your mood changing for the better!</p>\n<p><strong>L-tyrosine and its precursor Phenylalanine:</strong> L-tyrosine sometimes fails to metabolize Phenylalanine. In this case, it is needed in order to control the decline of cognitive issues, seizures, and even retardation. You can see that this amino acid might very well play a role in mood affected by decline in cognition. Find L-tyrosine in these whole foods:</p>\n<p>Avocados, fish, chicken, and almonds</p>\n<p><strong>Glutamine:</strong> This one is the precursor to GABA. It increases GABA, thus having a calming effect. We can then concentrate and experience less stress-increasing our ability to be in better moods! It also seems to improve memory!</p>\n<p>These are just a few of the many amino acids that will help improve mood if balanced in the system. I could do an entire post on them&#8230;but I need to cover some other things!</p>\n<p>Moving on:</p>\n<p><strong>Sugar:</strong>\u00a0 This one is an obvious one. Of course we all know that sugar affects mood&#8230;we&#8217;ve seen how sugar addiction is so pronounced these days, in our kids and adults. So, if you remove sugar (and include things that turn into sugar in this category&#8230;refined carbohydrates, grains, potatoes, etc), you should see a vast improvement in mood!</p>\n<p>I apologize for keeping the rest of these so short. I would like to discuss them further if you would like to hear more&#8230;but it will need to be broken up again! So, moving on&#8230;</p>\n<p><strong>Gluten:</strong> You may well be gluten sensitive. While the statistics generally say that Celiac Disease (an autoimmune disorder due to extreme sensitivity to gluten that has inflammatory and other major health consequences) does not affect much of the population, what they don&#8217;t say is that gluten sensitivity is much larger in its affect. In fact, many people may be gluten-intolerant or gluten sensitive and not even know it. The reactions can be astronomical. Gluten definitely irritates the human body, and thus can even affect those neurotransmitters and the gut-brain connection. Remove grains and starches from the diet, eat whole foods like meat and green vegetables, and you will automatically remove the gluten. It is not needed, and removing it will make you feel better physically and mentally!</p>\n<p><strong>Food Additives:</strong> If you are eating processed foods, you might experience some mood issues. Not only are these foods loaded with chemicals and other bad-for-us things, but they can affect the brain. Many of these chemicals in processed foods are known as food additives. These include dyes, preservatives, artificial flavors, and more. These additives can be neurotoxins&#8230;which is to say that they are toxic to your neurotransmitters, brain, and the whole system! These chemicals can also alter the hormones, resulting in hormonal changes that will affect mood, slimming ability, and more. Of course, I must also add that you should really pay attention to the &#8220;clean 15 and dirty dozen&#8221; lists that the Environmental Working Group puts out regularly. If you buy the dirty dozen in an organic manner, you will reduce your risk of eating GMO or pesticide-treated foods. This way, you can save money and save your health at the same time!</p>\n<p><strong>Gut Health:</strong> I included this because I think it is so important to point you all toward some interesting research and writing about how the gut and brain really do communicate with one another in a manner we never knew! The gut is EXTREMELY important in our physical and psychological health. In fact, with a healthy gut, things like ADHD, ADD, depression, dyslexia, and schizophrenia may truly disappear! I encourage you to really study this, because there is a lot to it&#8230;the best resource is Natasha Campbell-McBride&#8217;s G.A.P.S. diet. You can read all about it here: <a href=\"http://www.gutandpsychologysyndrome.com/gaps-diet/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.gutandpsychologysyndrome.com/gaps-diet/</a></p>\n<p>Although I did not go into it, I STRONGLY recommend people pay a lot of attention to getting their guts healthy. It is probably the biggest issue, and one we can absolutely correct through nutrition. The above mentioned program and book will give it to you in great detail that is needed! I just want to say that if you remove grains, add some Omega-3s to balance those Omegas out, and eat whole foods and probiotics (fermented foods like sauerkraut or kombucha), you will find gut health is better and so is mental health!</p>\n<p>Thanks and have a healthy day!</p>\n<p>Rachel</p>\n<p>References</p>\n<p>Byrd, A.

Since this chronic illness affects many of those around me, I would like to share a compilation of helpful hints on ways to combat and help control this. Here are some of the things that MOST experts do agree on, and I have found to make scientific, physiological, and unbiased sense:</p>\n<p>1. Eat high quality protein (ie: fish, chicken, high quality beef&#8230;preferably grass fed)</p>\n<p>2. Get good fats&#8230;and remember that FAT IS NOT BAD&#8230;fats such as those that come from olive oil, coconut oil, nuts, and the meats mentioned above are great sources.</p>\n<p>3. If you eat carbs at a meal, make sure you eat protein with them.</p>\n<p>4. Try to limit your intake of carbs, especially refined ones. The carbohydrates usually consumed in America today are a major cause in the increase of blood sugar levels.</p>\n<p>5.\u00a0Space out carb consumption throughout the day in smaller portions. This permits the body&#8217;s control over spikes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>6. Reduce intake of artificial sweeteners such as Nutrisweet, Splenda, etc. Stevia seems to be a bit better.</p>\n<p>7. Eliminate consumption and use of hydrogenated oils such as Canola or Vegetable oil. These oils often can be considered poison to the system.</p>\n<p>8. Avoid cured meat. This is also more processed and not as high in good fats and nutrients.</p>\n<p>9. Eliminate refined foods and sweets.</p>\n<p>10. Aim for foods that don&#8217;t need an ingredient label (like produce or high-quality meats). If it requires an ingredient label, it is far less simple to understand.</p>\n<p>11. Read INGREDIENT labels&#8230;not just the NUTRITION labels. If the first three ingredients or a number of the ingredients are sugars, avoid it!</p>\n<p>12. Instead of white flours, use almond flour.</p>\n<p>13. Check what kinds of sugar alcohols are in the product. Xylitol is a sugar alcohol that seems to have little to no affect on insulin, while others might have some.</p>\n<p>14. Try lucein containing products such as some dairy if you are not lactose intolerant&#8230;but do not go overboard!</p>\n<p>15. If you can cut your carb intake to 25% of energy intake or to around 50-100g of carbs, you may have a better chance of reduction or reversal of your diabetic issues.</p>\n<p>16. Finally, get some exercise. Many researchers and experts have seen benefits come from even just a vigorous walk!</p>\n<p>I hope this helps some! If you have any questions, please feel free to post them. I am just now compiling all of my research on this, and hope to have more with time! If there is a question I am not sure about, I will research what I can and let you know!</p>\n<p>Thanks and have a healthy day!</p>\n<p>Rachel</p>\n", "post_id": 21, "location": false, "date": "02-14-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["carbs", "Healthy Transitions", "primal", "livin' la vida low carb", "carbohydrate", "Tips", "adrenal", "alternefit", "Mindy Noxon Iannotti", "Misty Humphrey", "carbohydrates", "sugar", "low-GI", "health", "low-GL", "exercise", "Diabetes", "Reverse or Control", "nutrition", "alternative", "T2DM", "eating", "fat loss", "food", "Type II Diabetes", "diet", "low-carb", "Healthy", "Diabetes Melitus", "Type 2 Diabetes", "lifestyle", "health and wellness", "jimmy moore", "blogs", "podcasts", "fitness", "Chronic Illness", "obesity", "recipes", "protein"], "text": "<p>Hey all,</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I wanted to point you toward episode 20 of Jimmy Moore&#8217;s newest podcast!

This blog will hopefully clear up some confusion about where our nutrition and health practices are at today compared to where they were at in the past (even as recently as pre-WWII). It will also attempt to help you understand that, in America, as well as in other countries, the advice we are given has financial backing, rather than keeping our health as priority. I must warn you that this topic can sometimes be a point of contention, and it may even make some angry; however, I assure you that some of the points I will make are things we need to wake up to in order to take back our health and well-being!</p>\n<p>I named this blog &#8220;Follow the Money&#8221; because that is really what a lot of the advice we are given is based on. This seems to happen on many levels when it comes to nutrition. Think about it carefully. For many of us, much of our lives have been filled with the ideas of eating &#8220;healthy whole grains,&#8221; making sure we get our daily allotted amounts of fruits and veggies, staying away from cholesterol, and eating low-fat. Why exactly are we given this advice? Is it because these things have been proven to help our bodies? Well, the epidemic of metabolic syndrome, health issues, and obesity we are in now should clue you in to that answer&#8230;no, obviously this advice has not helped. We have not gotten better. In fact, we have gotten worse!</p>\n<p>First, let&#8217;s think about what advice used to be in the area of nutrition. What advice did our ancestors\u00a0 follow? Did the medical professionals of the past recommend taking drugs for everything (as seems to be the case now)? If not, what did they recommend? When did this change occur? What were the factors leading up to that change? If the advice was different, what was the difference in health and health afflictions? Let&#8217;s take a look:</p>\n<p>One of my favorite sayings is by Hippocrates. It is &#8220;Let thy food be thy medicine and thy medicine thy food.&#8221; He said this in around 400 B.C. to his students. This, in my opinion, should be the basis of what we all understand and follow about nutrition. Think about it: Medical professionals must take the &#8216;Hippocratic Oath.&#8217; What is this oath based on? (clue: look at the first word and the name above)..yes, it is based on that man many believe is the father of western medicine: Hippocrates. So, if Hippocrates believed that food could be your medicine and that medicine could be your food, why are we now chasing after chemicals and man-made creations to try to heal ourselves?</p>\n<p>Also in 400 B.C., there seems to be some stories of Vitamin A from liver being squeezed into the eyes in order to treat eye disease. Of course, now we do know that Vitamin A can help prevent and treat eye disease, but we don&#8217;t have to squeeze it into our eyes!</p>\n<p>Moving into the 1700s, we find that scurvy was a huge problem. A doctor named James Lind has been cited as the person who discovered that scurvy relates to Vitamin C deficiencies (although, this was not known as the reason, then). Limes given to British sailors were found to prevent scurvy; hence, they became known as Limeys.</p>\n<p>In the 1800s, nutrition got a major influx in knowledge. First, it was found that foods were mostly comprised of carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen. Then, a German named Justus Liebig discovered that carbohydrates were made up of sugar, fats of fatty acids, and proteins of amino acids. Finally, a Dutchman named Christiaan Eijkman sought a cure for Beriberi&#8230;and found one in food!</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s skip ahead, though. We want to understand that distant past, but we also want to understand when and where the money part came in.</p>\n<p>Until the mid-1920s, the above nutrition discoveries were only being discovered in their infancy. The focus of the general public and governmental, medical, and scientific officials was not as sophisticated as it would soon become. Quantity, rather than quality was a focus (Mayhew, 1998). Then, in 1920, the British Medical Research Committee (later, Medical Research Council) was formed. The goal of this group was to organize research into health problems of the day (Mayhew, 1998). A professor named Edward Mellanby began looking into one of the main concerns of that time, rickets. He started research that seemed to suggest that cod liver oil and butter had fat-soluble vitamins in them which seemed to cure rickets in animals. This seemed to suggest the disease was caused by vitamin deficiencies (Mayhew, 1998). Unfortunately, his efforts to understand and spread this knowledge and more were interrupted by the war.</p>\n<p>Once it was discovered that nutritional deficiencies caused many of the afflictions of the early and mid-1900s, the government decided to step in. At the time, there were many things going on. Prohibition in the 1920s, the Great Depression in the 1930s, and much experimentation by food and product developers. Combining all of this with the poverty of the time, we can look at the money and false science trails.</p>\n<p>In the 1930s, many Americans suffered from malnutrition. The government decided to &#8220;enrich&#8221; or &#8220;fortify&#8221; foods that were commonly considered nutritionally devoid of these vitamins and minerals (grains etc.), but that were more readily available to poorer areas. Thus, a problem with malnutrition AND overconsumption and overweight began.</p>\n<p>Then, the Roosevelt administration decided to do something which I feel was the most ridiculous idea of all time: in order to keep farmers from flooding markets and lowering costs of food, Roosevelt decided to subsidize them with taxpayer dollars. The farmers would be paid to allow their fields to go bad and slaughter their animals, creating false scarcity. This, in turn, would drive prices up (Most, 2009). Now do you see where this is going? Money and politics created this cycle that led to poor diet and health problems. Science was trumped by profit and politics.</p>\n<p>Throughout history, there have been a number of mis-steps that caused such things to get worse. With the advent of organizations like the USDA, there came more politics and more payoffs &#8211; in the form of lobbying, partnering, and payoffs to scientists that would turn a blind eye to legitimate research evidence contrary to a company&#8217;s products.</p>\n<p>One prime example of this would be the McGovern Report. This report, and more can be reviewed at this site: <a href=\"http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread654969/pg1\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread654969/pg1</a></p>\n<p>I do not want to go into it because it could get very long and tedious, but I found the above site to be wonderfully explanatory about the money and politics behind such a report.</p>\n<p>The site above also mentions Ancel Keys. He was also a researcher that tailored his studies toward what was wanted from the politicians and food companies. Because of this, many medical associations began to also follow poor advice. It was also taught to doctors and nurses, leading to poor advice.</p>\n<p>THEN, in steps Big Pharma! As medicine advanced, so too did medications. Since diseases and health concerns were previously fixed with nutrition, the medical profiteers had to figure out a way to get people to pay for medicine rather than turn to the past to &#8220;fix&#8221; themselves. This was successfully done by lobbying (again), pay-offs, and mis-information to the politicians as well as the public. Now, we have a society that thinks it can be fixed by taking a pill, when in actuality, if we would get back to true healthy eating practices (avoiding processed foods, eating healthy fats like butter, olive oil, coconut oil, cod liver oil, and the like, and lowering our carb intake to MUCH MUCH lower than we do now), we will &#8220;fix&#8221; ourselves rather than cover up the real problems.</p>\n<p>Just think about this: You eat as the USDA recommends, as has been pushed for the past 30 years. You get sick with diabetes, heart disease, or other ailments. You go to the doctor (money). You pay your insurance (money). You get medicine to &#8220;fix&#8221; your ailment (money). You remain on the medicine for life (big money). You don&#8217;t ever get better, so you continue to support those things above. All the while, you are eating frankenfoods created by companies who make these foods that have made you sick (money). As long as you continue to support them by buying those foods that are cheap for the companies to produce and push off on you, you continue to support their greed. You also continue to support the greed of lobbyists for those companies, greed of Big Pharma, greed of politicians who ignore your health for the profit they can make from those companies, and the greed of the medical industry (who are supposed to care about your health&#8230;not their pocketbooks). Please do keep in mind, though, that many doctors just do not know. They get very little to no training in medical school. They do get biochemistry, but often forget much of this in order to specialize in their various fields. Your doctor may not be particularly greedy, but he or she may be blind to the brainwashing and payoffs that do happen. You can help educate the doctors by educating yourself. Cure yourself through nutrition, and you will be better for it&#8230;and so will the country&#8230;but those with the greedy money grubbing and power hunger will then suffer&#8230;and isn&#8217;t that a good thing? Would you rather see this country filled with unhealthy people who are controlled by wealthy elites and want you to serve them; or healthy, intelligent people who care about our species, well-being, each other, human health, and the planet? The choice is yours! Think about it! Defy the past 30 years and get back to what we knew&#8230;that food is our sustenance&#8230;and fake foods are death! Real, whole foods cure us and keep us well&#8230;fortified, enriched, subsidized, chemical-laden, GMO, poorly raised, treated fake foods keep us unhealthy and subservient&#8230;and I don&#8217;t know about you, but I want to be free&#8230;not a slave!</p>\n<p>Have a healthy day!</p>\n<p>Rachel</p>\n<p>References</p>\n<p>Nutrition Breakthroughs.

Club organizer, James Stewart was arrested at his home, the locks to his personal residence were changed, his papers, money and computer seized. At the same time, farmer Sharon Palmer and Weston A. Price Foundation volunteer chapter leader Victoria Bloch Coulter were arrested. All three were charged with Section 182A-Conspiracy to Commit a Crime. Bond for James Stewart was set at $123,000. Bail for Bloch is recommended at $60,000. Bail for Palmer is recommended at $121,000.</p>\n<p>All this, in a state where raw milk is perfectly legal to sell, and even available through retail stores. The issue seems to be the club\u2019s use of a herdshare or boarding agreement for its dairy goats. Recently, the California Department of Food and Agriculture issued a cease-and-desist order to a farmer boarding dairy animals for the animal owners. Another farmer, Mike Hulme of Evergreen Acres goat farm in San Jose, received a cease-and-desist letter from the Santa Clara County District Attorney&#8217;s office. Hulme and several people with ownership interest in goats kept at the farm are suing the state and county for interfering with their right to enter into a livestock boarding contract.</p>\n<p>The state insists the farmers need dairy licenses to conduct such operations.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is apparent that there is an orchestrated effort on the part of public health officials to curb raw dairy access in California, and around the nation,\u201d declares Pete Kennedy, Esq., President of the Farm-to-Consumer Legal Defense Fund.</p>\n<p>Arraignment is scheduled for tomorrow in Department 30, Los Angeles Superior Court, Fifth Floor, Criminal Justice Center, 210 W. Temple St., Los Angeles. Court opens at 8:30 a.m. The District attorney\u2019s office says it is likely they are to go before the judge during the morning session.</p>\n<p>A protest rally on the Los Angeles Courthouse Steps is planned for 8:00am tomorrow morning, when the three food rights activists are before the judge. Citizens concerned about access to healthy, locally produced foods are urged to attend.</p>\n<p>Concerned citizens are asked to donate to the Farm-to-Consumer Legal Defense Fund, an organization that works to protect and expand consumer access to whole, unprocessed foods of their choice, and to pave the way for unregulated, direct trade between farmer and consumer.

I have an opinion piece for you today. Let&#8217;s just get into it, shall we?</p>\n<p>I was at the store the other day, waiting in line at the checkout, and I saw a &#8220;Woman&#8217;s World&#8221; magazine. I noticed the cover story said something like &#8220;A Diet Better than Atkins or The Zone!&#8221; and went on to say you could lose blah blah pounds in blah blah days. So, I thought to myself, &#8220;Huh, I wonder what this is about.&#8221; When I opened it up to the cover story article, I found something interesting. It started by saying that a lady at the magazine was losing weight rapidly. People asked her what she was doing, and she responded by saying she was &#8220;eating like a cavewoman!&#8221; At first glance, I was excited by this. I thought, &#8220;Wow, awesome! Paleo is making it into Woman&#8217;s World! That&#8217;s pretty mainstream!&#8221; Then, I continued to read. As I perused, I noticed there was a picture of CHEX cereal in the middle of the article. At first I thought it might be a bit about what NOT to consume when one is eating like a cavewoman. It did happen to be next to a picture of soy as well. Of course, my first thoughts about both of these were wrong! The article actually RECOMMENDED eating these non-cavewoman things! Really? I was completely disappointed! How could anyone write that? Who really believes that processed cereal is something our Paleolithic ancestors would have eaten? Oh, yeah, I can see it now:</p>\n<p>Paleo woman is walking along, foraging. She suddenly sees the great CHEX CEREAL PLANT! Of course! That&#8217;s totally natural! Oh, and this CHEX CEREAL plant is growing right next to that totally paleo soy! She runs over and picks it! NOW, now she will be set for a long time! No food worries there!</p>\n<p>WHAT!!!!????!!!! Correct me if I&#8217;m wrong, but this is a ridiculous scenario! I just don&#8217;t think that Woman&#8217;s World worker was eating like a cavewoman if she included processed cereal and soy (unfermented, even) products!</p>\n<p>I must tell you all, I did not read the rest of the article in its entirety because I was so disgusted by the suggestion that a cavewoman would eat these things. I also did not want to spend my money on such nonsense&#8230;but now I am wishing I would have done so&#8230;so I could seriously share some of the ridiculousness with you! Maybe I will go to the store this evening and pick one up, just for that. It goes against what I would normally do, but I think it would be worth it to explore.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for a NEW post on this! I will give you the details then! Until then, enjoy this funny image I designed to represent the image of a cavewoman eating cereal!

There has also been some discussion about the &#8216;proof&#8217; anyone has when it comes to nutrition. This seems to have led to many debates: the science debates, the historical debates, and even the debates about who is &#8216;really&#8217; doing Paleo and who is &#8216;not.&#8217;</p>\n<p>Silly, I tell you! Silly!</p>\n<p>Why do I say that? Well, I personally feel that Chris Kresser had it when he wrote a blog about the &#8220;Paleo Template.&#8221; What a great idea! My friends on Low Carb Conversations and I discussed this for episode 20 of that podcast. My opinion: I subscribe to it wholeheartedly! There are many ways people take the &#8216;Paleo&#8217; message, and many ways of life. We are all individuals with different bodies, lives, and aspects&#8230;so why say that EVERYONE should do ONLY this or ONLY that? I am a firm advocate for individual choice (An it harm none, do what thou wilt), and with that belief comes the understanding that each person views his or her own world in his or her own light. I also accept the responsibility that comes with my choices and advocations. With that being said, I do believe that there is no such thing as &#8216;Perfect Paleo.&#8217; How can there be? We don&#8217;t have enough knowledge about the era to truly KNOW it, let alone live it today. I also understand that cultures and lives vary today as they may well have in the past. This can make for some differences, in my opinion. Let&#8217;s look at it this way: We don&#8217;t all find that low-fat or SAD diets work for EVERYONE, right? Why would we say that ours does? It just can&#8217;t be factually said without debate and success stories in many aspects. I honestly don&#8217;t believe that there is a SINGLE DIET for EVERYONE. Now, don&#8217;t get me wrong, I am of the belief that there are certain things one can do to help one stay healthy and THRIVE; however, what is right for one may not be right for another (one man&#8217;s trash kinda deal, right). My own beliefs and experiences have led me toward discussions more on the Paleo/Primal/Low-Carb front. Ultimately, I think these are generally lifestyles that push people toward real, whole, unprocessed, unrefined foods. THAT is important to me. I believe that such foods have a HUGE impact on our well-beings (whole and separate). I have seen it, experienced it, and felt it. BUT, I am open and willing to work with those who choose other things.</p>\n<p>Science is a fascinating thing. It is something that really varies&#8230;some of the sciences have some strong data and correlations that hold true. Others can vary. I look at nutrition sciences as one of those great mysteries of life. While we know a good deal about biology, anatomy, biochemistry, and human physiology, we still do not know for sure how everything works. Science (and in particular, nutrition science), is one of those things that needs wording like &#8216;sometimes,&#8217; &#8216;for some people,&#8217; &#8216;in this case,&#8217; and &#8216;most likely.&#8217; Maybe one day we might not have to say that, but so far&#8230;well&#8230;</p>\n<p>Anyway, I am personally dedicated to getting more people to eat real, whole, unprocessed, unrefined foods if they so choose. I believe that is the ultimate message of &#8216;Paleo.&#8217; To me, it is not about following a way of living that emulates cavemen and women. While that is a catchy way to introduce people that I have absolutely embraced, I don&#8217;t think our lives could truly emulate this in real life. We can choose to eat better ingredients. We can choose to live with less physical, mental, and emotional stress. We can get more sleep. We can listen to our bodies. We can do N=1 experiments so we find what works for us and what does not&#8230;and that, to me is living healthfully. I think Paleo is about healthy living&#8230;choosing that way of life that helps us THRIVE. Emulations, no. Personal health and success: yes! Trust me, I don&#8217;t think we all need to go out and find caves, get rid of our refrigerators and stoves, or anything else. I just think we should try to live as healthfully and &#8216;sustainably&#8217; as we can&#8230;for ourselves, our world, and our planet!</p>\n<p>One last thought: While you may have a different idea about this than I, and while you might not agree with me, I support you. I find that we should each support one another in order to spread the word and grow this way of life that is bound to be more healthy and freeing for our world, planet, and fellow man!</p>\n<p>Thanks and have a healthy day!</p>\n<p>Rachel</p>\n<p>My inspirations for this were as follows:</p>\n<p>Mark Sisson: <a href=\"http://www.marksdailyapple.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.marksdailyapple.com/</a></p>\n<p>Mat LaLonde: <a href=\"http://podiumlive.com/crossfit/index.php?option=com_content&#038;view=article&#038;id=8&#038;Itemid=12\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://podiumlive.com/crossfit/index.php?option=com_content&#038;view=article&#038;id=8&#038;Itemid=12</a></p>\n<p>Robb Wolf: <a href=\"http://robbwolf.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://robbwolf.com/</a></p>\n<p>Chris Kresser: <a href=\"http://chriskresser.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://chriskresser.com/</a></p>\n<p>Misty Humphrey: <a href=\"http://www.free-healthy-diet-plans.com/about-me.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.free-healthy-diet-plans.com/about-me.html</a> (You rule, sistah!)</p>\n<p>Jimmy Moore: <a href=\"http://www.livinlavidalowcarb.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.livinlavidalowcarb.com/</a></p>\n<p>Mindy Noxon Iannotti: <a href=\"http://minthickandthin.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://minthickandthin.com/</a></p>\n<p>AHS 11: <a href=\"http://ancestryfoundation.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://ancestryfoundation.org/</a></p>\n<p>and finally&#8230;to all my friends in the IPMG (International Paleo Movement Group)!

I am not sure if the many elementary schools, middle schools, junior highs, and high schools around your area have started back for the new year, but here in Dallas the first day of the new school year was yesterday. In honor of all the parents, teachers, families, administrators, and children out there, I thought I would do a helpful, healthful eating post! While I don&#8217;t have school-age children, I would like to suggest some ideas for healthy and happy school days! The idea is to help get our children into a spot of better health and happiness. In turn, we should have a healthier, happier world in the long run! So, without further ado:</p>\n<p>Suggestions for a healthy start:</p>\n<p>Breakfast can often be a rushed time during the school year. While weekend breakfasts might focus more on eggs and bacon (a healthy breakfast for all), some parents might like to know some quick breakfast options to help their kids start the school day off right. Here are some ideas:</p>\n<p>1. Hard-boil some eggs the night before. Peel them and pack them up in individual baggies. I often put in two per baggie. This is a start. You can add some jerky if you have it on hand. It is a great, quick, healthy breakfast that will give your kids a jump-start on the day!</p>\n<p>2. Do your kids like cereal? Get them off of the cereal by making a healthier treat! Try putting together some individual berry and coconut milk cups. Using a lidded container, mix up some raw nuts (almonds, cashews, macadamias, walnuts, or pecans) and coconut flakes. In the morning, add some seasonal fruit. Mix this with a cup of coconut milk (in the can or homemade, preferably), and you have a great cereal substitute that is ten times better for your children&#8217;s health!</p>\n<p>Lunch during the school year can also be challenging. Some simple suggestions are as follows:</p>\n<p>1. Pack a healthy lunch for your kids and yourself! While there are many choices available these days, options for healthy living can be challenging. If you take the time to prepare lunches the night before, kids will reap the benefits and so will you! Some options for healthy lunches include left-overs from the night before, hard-boiled eggs, and a variety of veggies.</p>\n<p>2. Options to avoid the typical sandwich might be lettuce wraps or special home-made &#8216;breads&#8217; like the almond muffins I have a recipe for in another blog here: <a href=\"http://alternefit.wordpress.com/2011/03/14/here-is-your-spot-to-share-healthy-recipes/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://alternefit.wordpress.com/2011/03/14/here-is-your-spot-to-share-healthy-recipes/</a></p>\n<p>3. Options to replace those unhealthy, processed foods that are often served in school lunchrooms include things like those left-overs made at home the night before and nitrate- and nitrite-free lunch meats (wait for it&#8230;.) bacon!</p>\n<p>For snacks, a parent might pack some beef jerky (preferably home-made), dried fruits, seeds, nuts, or home-made pork skins. if that is not an option, there are some great resources for pre-packed &#8220;Paleo&#8221; snacks that include similar options. One thing I have recently done is to take unsweetened coconut flakes, a bit of water, some ground nuts, and a few berries (blueberries and strawberries are my favorites) and put them in a baggie. Then, I smoosh them with my hands until the coconut compacts and creates a bar. This is a very tasty and filling treat! Another idea that kids might enjoy would be to do this with some dark chocolate mixed in. Just shave the chocolate square into the mix and smoosh! Now you have a much healthier version of a candy bar!</p>\n<p>Dinners are an important part of the school year. These can be times when parents and children catch up! Try to make dinners at home. Fresh ingredients are always a best choice! I like to make different recipes on Sundays just in case I don&#8217;t feel like cooking during the week. This might be a handy idea for those working families with very busy lives. That way, you can just heat it up and have a nice family dinner. Sit at the table with your kids and enjoy those wonderful mealtimes! It is important for all!</p>\n<p>Finally, I did want to throw out some suggestions regarding school time activities and sleep. I know these are not foods, but they are just as important to a kid&#8217;s and family&#8217;s well-being. Make sure you start the day with one of those nice breakfasts I mentioned above, give the kids (and even yourself) every opportunity to have healthy snacks and lunches when away, and join together to cook and have healthy family meals&#8230;.but don&#8217;t forget to have some play time! Outside play time is a great idea for kids and adults! Just a bit of time in the sun will do a world of good. Don&#8217;t slather on the sunscreen right away, either. Enjoy the sun while you can. Get that vitamin D! Then, nearing bed-time, take some time to wind down. It might be a good opportunity to read together. Turn off the TV and other distractions, lay down in a family snuggle, and tell stories! This is how I grew up&#8230;and it really is one of the best memories of my childhood! I remember my parents reading to my brother and me. We often had back-scratching, story telling sessions that were awesome! It is relaxing, and does help relieve stress! Give it a try!</p>\n<p>Well, I do hope this post has helped give some direction for the new school year! Make it a healthy one!</p>\n<p>Until next time, folks! Have a healthy day!</p>\n<p>Rachel</p>\n<p>For more healthy Paleo Parenting tips, see the following sites:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://paleoparents.com/2011/packing-a-paleo-lunch-is-easier-than-you-think/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://paleoparents.com/2011/packing-a-paleo-lunch-is-easier-than-you-think/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://everydaypaleo.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://everydaypaleo.com/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://theprimalparent.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://theprimalparent.com/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://nomnompaleo.com/post/1456007524/lunch-in-and-packed-to-go\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://nomnompaleo.com/post/1456007524/lunch-in-and-packed-to-go</a></p>\n", "post_id": 251, "location": false, "date": "08-29-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://dfw.cbslocal.com/2011/08/30/film-buff-turns-passion-for-movie-cars-into-a-business/#.Tl2rIrEaN3w.wordpress\">Film Buff Turns Passion For Movie Cars Into A\u00a0Business</a>.</p>\n<p>It may not be health and wellness related, but this is a segment on my hubby that just aired on CBS News at 10!!!!

Don&#039;t fall for it!</p></div>\n<p>Hello Everyone,</p>\n<p>Well, as has previously happened, the Paleo &#8220;diet&#8221; has landed in a health &#8220;news&#8221; article. This time the culprit was Dr. Melina Jampolis on CNN Health. In a sad case of SAD diet advice (most likely bought and paid for), the &#8220;Is the Paleo diet healthy&#8221; article run on CNN Health and discussed by &#8220;expert&#8221; Dr. Melina Jampolis not only missed the mark&#8230;it made no sense! Yes, I am a Paleo lifestyler. I believe in the Paleo/Primal ways of life. What these are might be a bit different per person, but they are generally backed by science&#8230;basic science such as endocrinology, biochemistry, anatomy, and physiology. It only takes one trip into these sciences to realize the basics: food affects the body in a variety of ways, the body is a complicated place, and there is a lot to understanding how the external affects the internal. One thing seems for sure to me: eating REAL, WHOLE, UNPROCESSED foods in a fashion that satisfies and fulfills much of the body is much healthier than eating some processed crap created by chemists in labs or buying such things from so-called experts who offer their own SAD brands and prescribe poor advice along with their expensive services!</p>\n<p>Where is all of this coming from and where is it headed, you might ask. Good questions! As I said earlier, there was an article in CNN Health written by this so-called &#8220;expert.&#8221; It wasn&#8217;t as much of an article as it was an &#8220;expert&#8221; answer to an important question. The basic gist of it was that the girl writing in was obese and trying to lose weight. She wanted to know if the Paleo diet was a healthy lifestyle change &#8220;despite the promotion of saturated fat and cholesterol.&#8221; The response was incredibly sickening to many people, including me. In fact, not only was this Dr. Melina Jampolis&#8217; response mis-guided, but it was also closed-minded and confusing. This CNN &#8220;expert started out answering the question by applauding the questioner for staying away from &#8220;fad diets.&#8221; While the Paleo lifestyle has gained momentum recently, I wouldn&#8217;t say that it is a &#8220;fad diet.&#8221; How can a way of eating that is based on the body&#8217;s needs throughout history be a &#8220;fad&#8221;? How can eating for optimal growth, as has been successful in our evolutionary past be a &#8220;fad&#8221;? How exactly can eating as history and science have shown us works well for human beings be a &#8220;fad&#8221;? I see a problem here. By definition, a fad is &#8221; a practice or interest followed for a time with exaggerated zeal; craze&#8221; (Merriam-Webster Incorporated,\u00a0 2011), and the definition of a fad diet is &#8220;a weight loss diet that becomes very popular (often quickly) and then may fall out of favor (sometimes just as quickly)&#8221; (Everydiet.org, 2004). What is the problem when calling Paleo a &#8220;fad&#8221;? Well, Paleo is short for Paleolithic, which is an era that consists of a long period of time. It is a period of human pre-history beginning at least 2.6 million years ago and continuing up to at least the development of agriculture c. 10,000 BC (Conjecture Corporation, 2003-2011). The idea behind the Paleo lifestyle (considered a &#8220;fad diet&#8221; by this so-called CNN expert) is that we humans have evolved from these ancestors. This evolution created a system of processes in the body that were designed to help us survive&#8230;and survive we have. For thousands of years we survived by moving specific ways, eating a variety of natural foods, and growing our bodies through such processes. With the advent of industry within agriculture, we began to notice problems. Health issues became more prevalent. At the time we may not have understood the processes of the body or the reasons these things were beginning to crop up; however, history shows us that something happened to cause more problems. The subject of just what has been hotly debated, but, to me, one thing is certain: illness shows up when processing and toxins used as foods show up. Science of the body shows that many people tend to have problems with certain foods and so-called foods. More disease and chronic illness occurs now than ever before&#8230;and it is on the rise. We no longer, as a society, promote eating as our ancestors ate. Our society tends to support money before it promotes healthy living. Well, I have seen the other side, folks, and I can tell you that our Paleolithic ancestors seem to me to have the right idea&#8230;eat whole, real, unprocessed foods. Eliminate those things that just aren&#8217;t viable or reasonable in the human system. That includes grains and legumes, in my opinion. Why is this? Well, have you ever tried to just pick a piece of wheat or a bean and eat it right there? I have, and I can tell you that I couldn&#8217;t even keep it in my mouth without having issues, let alone imagine what it would do inside my body. Now, have you ever picked something like lettuce or eaten raw meat? Again, I have, and it was much more palatable. I could see it being feasible food for my ancestors.</p>\n<p>But, I digress&#8230;</p>\n<p>On to more of this CNN article and this so-called &#8220;expert&#8221; who has chosen to ignore the science and confuse people.</p>\n<p>Dr. Melina Jampolis goes on to tell this person information that was obviously not researched well at all. She seems to believe that the Paleo lifestyle is a high-protein diet that excludes several foods. Yes, the Paleo community generally does promote avoiding grains, legumes, processed foods (including processed oils), and potatoes. My problem with her response here is that she got it wrong in two places. It is not high-protein and it does not necessarily exclude sweet potatoes (which she states in parentheses in her response). If you are a reader of my blog, you might know that I am a fan of raw dairy for some and that I do occasionally eat a sweet potato. I have no problem with these things as long as they do not appear to be food sensitivities to the person consuming them. Also, you will realize that I do not promote high-protein; rather, I feel a Paleo lifestyle is more about eating whole, unprocessed, real foods and not fearing the good fats! That is the key. Fat from avocados, coconuts, animal sources, and olives are not unhealthy fats and they will not make you fat&#8230;body sciences show this well. So, this &#8220;expert&#8221; got her message mixed up, possibly because she did not fully research the lifestyle before attacking in her response.</p>\n<p>I do have to give this woman a bit of credit for stating that sugar and refined grains can cause obesity and a host of other issues. Kudos for putting that in, as many other &#8220;experts&#8221; would not even go that far. But, with that said, I think she screwed up terribly with her cons and overall response.</p>\n<p>In her cons, she states that typical OLD and WASHED UP response about saturated fat and cholesterol&#8230;further propagating the false &#8220;wisdom&#8221; put forth just 40 or 50 years ago due to money and fear. If the research an &#8220;expert&#8221; relies on is outdated, the advice may well be too&#8230;and we see that here. There have been any number of studies regarding the falsity of the saturated fat and cholesterol myths (for more, do a search on this blog for these subjects or visit any number of research sites such as Pubmed or others referenced throughout my many blog posts). The outdated response relating these foods to cancer and other diseases shows how much this &#8220;expert&#8221; researches on her own. So, basically, you can see from her response that Dr. Melina Jampolis does not tend to research well for her responses. I certainly wouldn&#8217;t want a doctor telling me how to live if she doesn&#8217;t continue to learn through her life, would you?</p>\n<p>So, this CNN &#8220;expert&#8221; has already proven herself as a person who does not do her research, subscribes to old ideas, and keeps the population in the dark and unhealthy. She has told this person who needs help to avoid a lifestyle that encourages eating REAL, WHOLE, UNPROCESSED foods, and she even adds that one of the reasons this should be avoided is because it is expensive! Are you kidding me?! Last time I checked being unhealthy and having to go to the doctor who prescribes medications for symptoms that one would have to take for life because the lifestyle was not fixed is EXTREMELY expensive! Hmm, pay a cent or two more for grass-fed and pastured meats and eggs and organic veggies from local farms and ranches (hence also supporting my own neighborhood) or eat crap and pay a rich doctor to get richer while I get sicker&#8230;which option would I recommend? That answer is obvious&#8230;I choose my health&#8230;I choose my community&#8230;.I choose happy animals with good lives&#8230;I choose freedom from drugs and disease.</p>\n<p>Finally, I need to bring your attention to something one more time. I have said before that we need to follow the money with our choices and beliefs. This is no different. Sometimes you may not realize that these &#8220;experts&#8221; recruited by corporations and media sources often have another agenda. Rather than being proponents for your health, they are more proponents for their own pocketbooks. Dr. Melina Jampolis is no different. This lady actually sells her own terrible version of protein bars. I have to say, these bars have a long, strange ingredient list. They are definitely not made of whole, real, healthy foods. Some of the things in them don&#8217;t make sense as ingredients for a &#8220;healthy&#8221; bar. The above picture is a screen-shot of these bars. I have highlighted strange things in these ingredients. These are certainly questionable in my book! They are things that show me that this &#8220;expert&#8221; does have an agenda in her responses&#8230;and that agenda does not include healthy living for you!</p>\n<p>One final thought: In trying to debate openly with this &#8220;expert&#8221; through the CNN blog, my comments were denied. I was blocked by her on Facebook, as were many of my healthy living advocates in the Paleo community. Even those who gave her research links were put down and denied by her. Someone that is not open to debate, research, and conversation with those whose opinions differ is not someone I would want as my &#8220;expert&#8221; or doctor, would you?</p>\n<p>Dr. Melina Jampolis and CNN, I have this to say: FAILEO! Start researching, listening, and learning with an open mind and health in mind rather than your own bottom line and then you can be called an expert! Until then, you are just a paid lackey for Big Agri, Big Business, Big Pharma, and Big Brother&#8230;I see you as not concerned about the health and well-being of mankind&#8230;and only concerned for the health of your own bank accounts!</p>\n<p>Readers: BUYER BEWARE! Keep your life in mind! Remember to question and learn all you can&#8230;look at the science and consider the history. You will be healthy, wealthy, and wise for it!</p>\n<p>Have a healthy day!</p>\n<p>Rachel</p>\n<p>References and thanks:</p>\n<p>Conjecture Corporation.

Well, I can tell you that I do have my own personal experience with this. I suspect my own wonderful husband is a &#8216;super-taster&#8217; (meaning, essentially, extra taste buds on the tongue), so he tends to be a pretty picky eater! Since this is a hot question, I thought I&#8217;d do a blog post that included tips for introducing new varieties to those picky eaters in our lives! I&#8217;m also going to give some possible explanations into reasons for picky eating!</p>\n<p>First, let&#8217;s talk about reasons some may be picky eaters. This will not cover the entire spectrum of reasons (there could be any number of them out there, for we are all individuals in our own rights), but it could help narrow down possibilities that would help get friends and families adjusted to new foods!</p>\n<p>1. <strong>Super-tasters:</strong> As I mentioned about my husband, one reason for picky eating could be that the person is a super-taster. These are people who are generally much more sensitive to bitter tastes and fattiness in foods (a.k.a.: umami taste) (Vacca Foeda, 2010). To explain a bit more, most researchers believe in the ability of the tongue to have 5 basic tastes. These are:</p>\n<p>a. Bitter</p>\n<p>b. Salty</p>\n<p>c. Sour</p>\n<p>d. Sweet</p>\n<p>e. Umami (fatty/savory) (Ikeda, K. shortened by Ogiwara, Y, &amp; Ninomiya, Y, 2002)</p>\n<p>Super-tasters tend to be especially sensitive to foods that are considered bitter or umami (Wikipedia.org, 2011). These would be things such as coffee, dark chocolate, broccoli, fat on meats, or meat broths. Such people may often not want to eat these and other bitter or umami-tasting foods. I don&#8217;t have any citations for this next piece, but I have also heard that super-tasters may also enjoy the sweet tastes, and be more partial to bland and sweet foods (although, there have been other reports and opinions on this). So as not to make a whole blog out of this, I have included some various references at the end of this blog that will give you more information on this subject, as well as sources for testing and understanding super-tasters.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Autism and Neurological Dysfunction:</strong> This one was pointed out by one of my IPMG friends. She stated that scrawny and picky might be one sign of Autism (this includes Aspbergers). Since texture has a big part in such dysfunctions, there could be a chance of these being the issue. Check out this test and site for more on this: <a href=\"http://school.familyeducation.com/learning-disabilities/behavior/56323.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://school.familyeducation.com/learning-disabilities/behavior/56323.html</a></p>\n<p><strong>3. Food Intolerance and Allergies:</strong> Sometimes people do not realize that there might be a food intolerance or allergy in someone who does not like certain foods. This could be particularly true of wheat, dairy, or other common allergenic foods. In this case, you might try getting a full spectrum allergy test done. Another good way of determining this would be to ask the person whether these foods hurt him or her when he or she eats them. If so, allow that person to avoid them, and work with some of the alternatives I will list in the sections below. This might be especially positive when it comes to some of those foods we do not realize are toxic to most people.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Neophobia: </strong>This is a fear of the unknown or new. Often characterized in children after the age of 2 (a common time of weaning off of breast-feeding in many traditions), neophobia can manifest as picky eating at any age, really. A person with this issue could either not want to try new foods or just flat-out deny them (Wickford, 2011). It is almost like a fight or flight response for many. The idea is that these foods are unfamiliar therefore, may not be safe (Bainbridge, n. d.). Some experts in psychology believe that neophobia can manifest due to frightening or unpleasant situations regarding food as well (Wickford, 2011). Others believe that the cause can be both genetic and environmental (Wickford, 2011).</p>\n<p><strong>5. Growth: </strong>Many people see picky eating in the pre-teen and teen years. This is a common response of growth, in both physical and mental capacities. If this is the case, the person may only choose to eat foods that are comfortable or &#8216;cool&#8217; to eat. In this case, it may just take working with the person to find reasoning and sensibility for why such foods are desired and what could be done to add in new foods.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Texture:</strong> Texture is often an issue for many picky eaters. Many of us might remember disliking certain foods at different times in our lives. While texture is very common in neurological dysfunctions (see above), it can also be a standard personal issue. I remember hating mushrooms as a youth. I also remember my brother hated tomatoes. Now, I enjoy many varieties of mushrooms (although the first time I decided to try them as I got older, I do remember being squeamish at the texture&#8230;but I got over it). I&#8217;m not sure if my brother does tomatoes or not now, but I have heard that these two foods are common dislikes of picky eaters.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Check the Gut:</strong> Some people tend to avoid foods because they may have bad experiences digestive-wise with them. This could be a sign of leaky gut or other intestinal/gut issues. One important thing to do in this case is talk to the picky eater about how this food makes him or her feel. Another is to get the picky eater tested. You can do that through the mail from Entero Labs here: <a href=\"http://www.enterolab.com/Default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.enterolab.com/Default.aspx</a> or at a lab near you!</p>\n<p>So, what can you do if you have a picky eater? I think the first step is to find out why the person might be avoiding certain foods or just eating others. Once this determination is made, here are some suggestions.</p>\n<p>If you know that your picky eater has no allergies or other health problems regarding foods, you can help him or her begin to try new foods. I would still recommend avoiding wheat (see references to Dr. William Davis&#8217; Wheat Belly book for more on this) and other foods with anti-nutrients (legumes, other grains). Otherwise, here are some common ways to help a picky eater not be so picky (and if the picky eater is scrawny, adding these suggestions into the diet might help grow the body as well):</p>\n<p><strong>1. Try sauteing veggies:</strong> By sauteing things, commonly the texture and taste will change. You can even saute in real butter and preferable spices to help the veggies take on the flavor of the butter and spices. You can also saute the veggies in bacon fat or grease. This adds a nice flavor and gives them necessary added fat. Just DON&#8217;T use those nasty hydrogenated seed or vegetable oils. Those are highly processed garbage. They take away the nutrition of the meal!</p>\n<p><strong>2. Add Bacon or other fatty, good meats:</strong> This also adds to the flavor of veggies and adds the required good fats to the meal. You can saute, steam, boil, or bake veggies and add the browned or cooked up meats to them during or after making (during is the best for more flavor, in my opinion).</p>\n<p><strong>3. Try &#8220;hiding&#8221; the veggies within the tasty foods:</strong> For example, you could make a meatloaf (sans wheat, please) and add spinach in it. This can mask the flavor and/or texture of the added ingredient. You can also puree various foods into other foods so that they won&#8217;t be noticed. This is commonly done for stuff like liver or other organ meats (a food many people are not a fan of, but one that is one of the top nutritious foods we can eat).</p>\n<p><strong>5. Roast the food:</strong> This can go for veggies and meat. You can roast it with lots of butter or other good fats. It can change the flavor and texture of veggies and meats completely!</p>\n<p><strong>6. Wrap other foods in bacon:</strong> Many people love bacon, and it is good for you. Try utilizing that! You can wrap all kinds of foods in bacon and grill them or bake them to tastiness!</p>\n<p><strong>7. Link foods to interests:</strong> This one mainly applies to kids, but you can make various foods into shapes via cookie cutters. This could be meat, veggies, or both. Sometimes, the idea of playing with the food might be okay (as long as you don&#8217;t buy the processed garbage and you don&#8217;t do it with every food, I think this is fine).</p>\n<p><strong>8. Give it time:</strong> Sometimes you just have to give it time. As palates change, a taste for different foods and a lack of desire for other foods might occur. Tastes change as we change our eating styles. When one is used to thinking &#8216;crap&#8217; tastes good, the real foods might not be so palatable&#8230;this WILL change. It&#8217;s essentially a re-training of the taste-buds (in the mouth and in the gut)!</p>\n<p><strong>9. Make it together:</strong> Sometimes inclusion really helps people open up to new foods. If a child or other picky eater is asked to be involved in the process, it might get the juices flowing (in the mouth as well as in the head)! You might find that by including the picky eater in the preparation, that person will feel more interested and proud in the partaking of the meal as well!</p>\n<p>I hope that many of you can use some of the above information and suggestions. In the references below, I am including some sites with great, healthy recipes that might be good to introduce to picky eaters!</p>\n<p>Until next time, have a healthy day!</p>\n<p>Rachel</p>\n<p>References</p>\n<p>Bainbridge, C.

Since there are a ton of questions about it, I have decided to give you all of that information here. Try it out, share it with a friend, and tell your lifestyle-friendly doctor!</p>\n<p>Here is the recipe:</p>\n<p>1 scoop Vegan Proteins + (you don&#8217;t have to use this brand or kind of protein&#8230;go with the protein powder you like)</p>\n<p>1 medium frozen banana (yes, they do have carbs&#8230;about 15 or so)</p>\n<p>1 cup of unsweetened almond milk (use whatever milk you would like&#8230;just not skim or low-fat!)</p>\n<p>Ice as needed (sometimes it might not be thick enough)</p>\n<p>Blend on &#8220;Ice Crush&#8221; settings in blender</p>\n<p>ENJOY!</p>\n<p>Now, for the breakdown:</p>\n<p>The brand of protein powder I use is Non-GMO, has 20g protein and 7g carbs per scoop, and has no sugars or artificial ingredients added. It is double chocolate flavored and does have Stevia in it. This brand includes the following amino acids:</p>\n<p>Alanine 883 mg</p>\n<p>Arginine 1824 mg</p>\n<p>Aspartic Acid 2422 mg</p>\n<p>Cysteine 218 mg</p>\n<p>Glutamic Acid 3655 mg</p>\n<p>Glycine 866 mg</p>\n<p>Histidine 482 mg</p>\n<p>Isoleucine 765 mg</p>\n<p>Leucine 1672 mg</p>\n<p>Lysine 1543 mg</p>\n<p>Methionine 271 mg</p>\n<p>Phenylalaline 1062 mg</p>\n<p>Proline 1307 mg</p>\n<p>Serine 1141 mg</p>\n<p>Threonine 750 mg</p>\n<p>Tryptophan 173 mg</p>\n<p>Tyrosine 784 mg</p>\n<p>Valine 901 mg</p>\n<p>As the name implies, this product is vegan. Like I said earlier, you can choose the protein powder and flavor you wish. Be sure you get one that works for your body and food sensitivities, though! If you are new to it, you could go to your local whole foods type store and ask a professional in that department to help you. I&#8217;m sure they would be glad to&#8230;but make sure it is okay with your system by talking to your doctor about what might be right for you!</p>\n<p><em>Disclaimer:</em></p>\n<p><em>This blog is not intended to give medical advice.

I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_288\" style=\"width: 259px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"http://alternefit.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/nosugar.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-288\" title=\"nosugar\" src=\"https://alternefit.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/nosugar.jpg?w=249&#038;h=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"249\" height=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">It&#039;s not just sucrose you should look out for too!</p></div>\n<p>Sucrose: This sweetener is known as table sugar to most. A molecule made up of glucose and fructose, it is a disaccharide (one of four chemical groupings of carbohydrates. The others are monosaccharide, oligosaccharide, and polysaccharide). There are, in my opinion, many issues with sugar. It does have a relatively high glycemic index of 64. This means it is quick to cause response in blood sugar in the body. When consumed, sucrose processes into glucose in the body. Sucrose is one of the sugars that can cause issues such as tooth decay, diabetes, obesity, and gout. Along with other carbohydrates, sucrose may well be one of the products we should definitely avoid!</p>\n<p>Agave Nectar: Agave is actually more harmful for the health than HFCS. It has a more concentrated level of fructose in it. Agave has 70-90% refined fructose in it. Compare that to the 55% refined fructose in sodas. It is almost all sugar and refined.</p>\n<p>HFCS: Leads to obesity by tricking the body into not releasing fat regulators insulin and leptin. Fructose, and in particular HFCS, increases blood pressure, triglycerides, and small dense LDLs. It also depletes the body of vitamins and minerals. HFCS seems to have been a factor that would lead to cardiovascular disease, cancer, liver disease, arthritis, and gout.</p>\n<p>Xylitol: A sugar alcohol that has been touted as healthy. It kills bacteria in the mouth. It can cause gas and other intestinal upsets.</p>\n<p>Honey: This is high in fructose. It has a glycemic index rating of 62. The positive about it is that if it is local, it could contain some allergy fighting pollens in your area. It does spike blood sugar.</p>\n<p>Maple Syrup: Less fructose in this than in honey. It is safer in small doses.</p>\n<p>Fructose is metabolized in the body differently than glucose. 100% of break-down of fructose relies on the liver. Compare that to 20% break-down for glucose. Fructose is turned into free fatty acids and stored as fat in the body. Compare that to the fact that glucose can be used by the body before storage. Fatty acids accumulate in the liver as fat droplets. This causes non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and insulin resistance. This leads to T2DM and obesity.</p>\n<p>Sugar can cause kidney stone formation. Sugar depletes the body of magnesium and B6, which makes it more likely to form kidney stones.</p>\n<p>Sweet N Low, Nutrasweet, and Equal: These are both Aspartame. 200 times sweeter than sugar. Causes fatigue, headaches, diarrhea, depression, insomnia, and memory problems. Is a neurotoxin. Toxic to the brain. You can kill ants with aspartame. Symptoms of using Aspartame can mimic MS.</p>\n<p>Splenda: Sucralose. 600 times sweeter than sugar. Made by chemically altering it and adding chlorine to sugar to change the structure of the molecule. Side effects: Skin rashes, joint pain, heart palpitations, and sinus problems. Use of Splenda reduces the beneficial bacteria in the intestine and digestive system so the nutrients can\u2019t be broken down for proper digestion.</p>\n<p>95% of people drinking diet soda are at greater risk for metabolic syndrome.</p>\n<p>Stevia: 400 times sweeter than sugar and the best choice. Natural leaf that does not spike blood sugar. Good to go.</p>\n<p>Eurithrotol and Maltitol: Known as sugar alcohols, these are similar to Xylitol. Each sugar alcohol has a different scale of glycemic load and calorie count. They can be intestinally upsetting.</p>\n<p>Help and Resources for sugar addiction:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://howtothinkthin.com/\">http://howtothinkthin.com/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sugarshock.com/\">http://www.sugarshock.com/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.endsugaraddiction.com/\">http://www.endsugaraddiction.com/</a></p>\n<p>I hope these help!</p>\n<p>Have a healthy day!

I am back, though, and I &#8216;m hoping to reach more and more of you everyday!\u00a0</p>\n<p>As many of you know, I recently lost my job. This economy has not bode my former employer well, and his business was struggling. He made the decision to let me go because of this. That was a hard thing for me to handle. I struggled with his decision, but I had to accept it. I also decided it was the push I must have needed in order to concentrate on my health and wellness passion. So, here I am, writing my first blog post in months. Just the start of what is to come!</p>\n<p>But that got me thinking. At my previous job, I was constantly on my feet; constantly moving. I literally worked 8 hours standing and moving. That was important to me. I was very happy about the fact that my job was an active one. I never wanted to sit at a computer all day! I wanted to remain up and about!</p>\n<p>What does that mean for me now? Sitting here, writing this post, working on my book, and searching out mentors, income sources, and other such things, I am worried about my activity. Clearly, I am not up and about all day. There may not be a lot of up and about throughout the weeks, too. I don&#8217;t have a standing desk or a treadmill desk. I&#8217;m not sure that would be an answer for me either. I mean, even with one of those, I would still be in front of a computer more than I have been in years. That&#8217;s not necessarily something I want for myself.</p>\n<p>So what exactly will I do without such an active job? That&#8217;s what this post is really about! I&#8217;m not complaining or saying I don&#8217;t want to write, because I do. I just have to find ways to incorporate activity and breaks away from the computer into my new schedule. I can do that&#8230;and I have a plan for it! Wanna know what that is? I&#8217;ll share!</p>\n<p>1. I plan on waking up early enough to eat a breakfast consisting of bacon and eggs.</p>\n<p>2. I will then sit down and write, either on the blog or on my book.</p>\n<p>3. I will search through all the information and other things I need to do until lunch.</p>\n<p>4. At lunch, I will have a nice meal consisting of meat and veggies.</p>\n<p>5. After lunch, I will go outside and play. I have some roller skates I haven&#8217;t busted out in a long time. I think I&#8217;ll break them out again! Maybe I&#8217;ll dance!</p>\n<p>6. I will take a walk, or go out and pass out my resume and business cards by foot.</p>\n<p>7. Before dinner, I will do a good travel WOD or tabata workout (since I have had to cut back on costs, my CrossFit membership has to be suspended. I sure will miss those people for a bit).</p>\n<p>8. I will come home and make a dinner of meat and veggies&#8230;if I have done a relatively intense workout, I will add in a sweet potato or some other starchy veggie.</p>\n<p>9. After dinner, I will work more on my blog, the book, or whatever work I will be doing.</p>\n<p>10. nearing bedtime, I will relax and prepare for bed.</p>\n<p>11.

These foods are said to work on the sympathetic nervous system (which\u00a0is a big part of the stress response) (Zucker, 2000). These pseudostressors are as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>a.\u00a0 </strong>Caffiene containing products &#8211; these products increase metabolism and alertness, which, in turn, causes a release of hormones such as adrenaline (Zucker, 2000). It can also increase blood pressure and heart rate. Another issue with these foods is that they can cause havoc to happen on the nervous and digestive systems. Like in a stressful situation, the body begins to use that fight or flight response. It might increase its rate of fluid elimination as well (Zucker, 2000).</p>\n<p><strong>b.</strong>\u00a0 Carbohydrates &#8211; The body has an extremely hard time digesting these types of foods (which includes rice, flour, and that <strong>horrid</strong> and <strong>evil</strong>\u00a0high-fructose corn syrup). These foods can also cause malfunctions in the body. The reaction of the pancreas and insulin production can be devastating on the system when lots of carbs are consumed (or a small amount in T2DM or prediabetics). I don&#8217;t want to preach or drag on about this, but it is important to understand that these foods can cause the body to become very stressed and can lead to <strong>hypoglycemia</strong>, <strong>diabetes</strong>, and <strong>more</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>c.</strong>\u00a0 Processed foods &#8211; Yes, in today&#8217;s world a lot of people live on them. I have recently gone to a way of life in which I am cutting out most (if not all) of the processed foods I eat. This is because these foods are like a poison to the body. It is possible that these types of foods could be behind the excitement of the central nervous system in children with ADHD or other hyperactivity disorders (Zucker, 2000). I highly recommend people stay away from these. Even hydrogenated vegetable oils are reportedly not healthy. One might even call them poison.</p>\n<p><strong>d. </strong>\u00a0Alcohol &#8211; It is a depressant, but just as in the carb and sugar situations, alcohol can lend itself to that insulin reaction in the body, putting it under a great deal of stress (Zucker, 2000).</p>\n<p>There is so much to talk about on this topic! The literature is out there to help explain this. You can check out the Undergroundwellness.com website I list in the references to find out more!</p>\n<p>Also, like I said earlier, cortisol plays a major role in the process of stress response&#8230;and some foods (like diets high in carbs or too low in carbs) have a major affect on this. When the cortisol acts, the body reacts.</p>\n<p>Have a healthy day!</p>\n<p>Rachel</p>\n<p>References</p>\n<p>Croxton, S. (2010, Dec. 15). <em>Ponder this: Grains, robots, and zombies</em>.

So, what can we do to prevent this, or, in the case that you may already be coming down with a cold or flu, heal ourselves? Don&#8217;t fret! There are many natural methods to help yourself. No flu shots! Limited to no &#8216;cold and flu medicines&#8217;! You can prevent and heal with food, supplements, and lifestyle in general! Here are some methods I recommend, as do many professionals!</p>\n<p><em><strong>Prevention</strong></em></p>\n<p>Build your immune system with vitamins and minerals found in whole foods.</p>\n<p>-Selenium</p>\n<p>Found in Brazil nuts, this mineral is associated with an anti-oxidant called glutathione peroxidase that is made by our bodies. A deficiency in selenium can decrease this anti-oxidant. Because of this decrease, oxidative stress can make us more vulnerable to virus mutation. Making sure we have enough selenium can help stave off this vulnerability. Try eating 1-2 Brazil nuts per day (Yep, that&#8217;s all you need!). This is my preferred method of selenium retainment. If you are not going to get it via food, make sure your selenium supplement contains Selenomethionine. This is a form of selenium that occurs naturally in foods, and is better absorbed by the body (Julianne Taylor, July 3, 2010).</p>\n<p>-Zinc</p>\n<p>Some studies have found that zinc deficiency can increase susceptibility to infections. In order to have an adequately adapted immune system, and possibly reduce risk of respiratory issues, zinc levels should be maintained. A good source of zinc (for those who are not allergic to shellfish) is oysters. Other sources include seafood and grass fed meat. If you are going to supplement, I recommend a high-quality multi-vitamin (I use <a href=\"http://http://www.amazon.com/Twinlab-Allergy-Multi-Caps-Capsules/dp/B00013Z146\" target=\"_blank\">TwinLabs Allergy Multi-Caps</a>).</p>\n<p>-Vitamins A &amp; D</p>\n<p>In order for the immune system to function normally, the skin and cells that line the digestive tract, urinary tract, and airways need to be a strong first defense against infection (Julianne Taylor, 2003). Vitamin A is the nutrient that can help with this. Sources for Vitamin A include beef liver, cod liver oil, and yellow vegetables and fruits.</p>\n<p>Vitamin D has also been found to be important in immune system health. The mechanisms for Vitamin D&#8217;s role in immunity are complicated; however, it has been found in several studies to have a highly immunoregulatory role. Essentially, it has been shown to up-regulate antimicrobial peptides in immune cells (White, 2008). You can get Vitamin D from being out in the noontime sun for 15 mins &#8211; 1 hour (depending on skin color: the lighter you are, the less time, the darker, the more); however, this may not be enough. This is especially true if there is obesity or inflammation. A good source of Vitamin D (as well as Vit. A) is cod liver oil. There is a fermented cod liver oil/butter oil blend from <a href=\"http://www.greenpasture.org/public/Products/ButterCodLiverBlend/index.cfm\">Green Pastures</a> that I recommend, but just the addition of a bit of fermented cod liver oil and pasture raised butter can help. If you are going to get a Vitamin D supplement, make sure it is high quality and is Vitamin D3. The dosage amount will vary depending on your own levels, but 2000-4000 IU per day may be a starting point. I recommend knowing your levels and going from there, though.</p>\n<p>-Vitamin B6</p>\n<p>The B vitamins are really all important in immunity, but low Vitamin B6 has been associated with impaired immune system in several studies. You can find Vitamin B6 in pastured chicken and turkey, bananas, and spinach. A good multi-vitamin will also help.</p>\n<p>-Probiotics</p>\n<p>Probiotics are very important for gut health, and gut health is important for every single factor of health! Whether we want to believe it or not, our bodies NEED friendly bacteria in order to function properly.The bacteria helps us digest, absorb nutrients, make nutrients, and make vitamins. In order to keep a balance of these friendly bacterias in our guts (as well as keeping the bad bacterias down), we need to make sure we eat probiotic foods like sauerkraut, kombucha, kefir, or other fermented foods. We also need to keep out the foods that cause gut irritation. These include improperly prepared or raised foods like grains, legumes, and dairy. I personally have removed all grains and legumes, and only eat raw, pastured dairy. This helps my gut heal, and gives me a stronger gut; therefore, I have a stronger immune system than ever before.</p>\n<p>-Bone Broth</p>\n<p>There is a reason we all know to eat chicken soup when we&#8217;re sick! Homemade broth is filled with minerals like magnesium, phosphorus, sulfur, and other minerals that are hard for us to get from any other source. All of the vitamins and minerals found in homemade bone broth help boost health and vitality. To learn more about this, I recommend you visit the Weston A. Price Foundation&#8217;s website at: <cite><a title=\"Broth is Beautiful\" href=\"http://www.westonaprice.org/food-features/broth-is-beautiful.\" target=\"_blank\">www.westonaprice.org/food-features/broth-is-beautiful.\u00a0</a><em></em></cite></p>\n<p>I personally make bone broth every week or so. I then freeze it and try to get in at least a cup a day. When I feel a cold coming on, I up my cup to a bowl or two!</p>\n<p>-Sleep, rest, destress</p>\n<p>One of the most tried and true preventatives for colds and the flu is rest. Resting helps the body optimize immunity. The body likes to repair during sleep and rest periods. Getting adequate sleep at the right times of night is important. If you don&#8217;t sleep long enough, you may find you are feeling run-down. This is because the body works to protect itself during sleep. Not getting enough sleep can inflame the body and elevate inflammatory markers (Kresser, 2011). Prevention is simply in resting, sleeping, and engaging in relaxing activities like meditation.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Treatment</strong></em></p>\n<p>When all the preventatives have not helped, and we get a little croupy or ill-feeling, there are ways to treat. These are not medications that mask the symptoms (that&#8217;s really all those OTC medicines do). They are also not the so-called &#8216;preventative&#8217; toxic mixtures such as flu shots that are still not proven. These are natural, immune boosting remedies that will speed up your body&#8217;s own natural defenses and get you healthier faster!</p>\n<p>Help the immune system heal by boosting immune building nutrients</p>\n<p>-Increase your dosage of Fermented Cod Liver Oil.</p>\n<p>As was mentioned earlier, fermented cod liver oil is a good source for Vitamins A &amp; D (incidentally, it is also a really good source of those wonderful Omega 3 fatty acids that our body requires a good balance of). If you have become ill, up your normal dosage of fermented cod liver oil to get more of those immune boosting vitamins into your body!</p>\n<p>-Ginger, honey, and lemon in a tea</p>\n<p>This tried and true cold and flu remedy comes with some good research behind it. Because ginger is an anti-microbial, it can help with things such as nausea to the flu. Lemon, a good source of Vitamin C, combined with the ginger can soothe a sore throat. Add honey, a possible cough suppressant</p>\n<p>-Increase your probiotic intake</p>\n<p>If probiotics are ideal for boosting gut health, and therefore immunity, increasing the probiotic foods you eat during a cold or the flu may help fight it off. Boost the healing your body can do by eating more of the fermented foods listed above.</p>\n<p>-Sweat it out</p>\n<p>Yes, I said it. Sweat your cold or flu away! In fact, according to Chris Kresser (2011), Chinese medicine recommends sweating in the early stages of a cold. There are any number of methods I have seen and experimented with myself on this. The best is a nice, hot herb bath. Run a hot bath and add herbs like eucalyptus and rosemary to it. This will help you sweat and give you the healing benefits of the herbs! Another method I have used and seen promoted is exercise. While you may not feel like doing an intense workout when you&#8217;re sick, some have suggested that light exercise such as light yoga could be beneficial for speeding up the healing process. Finally, in this category, is the good, old-fashioned cover up and snuggle into bed. This does 2 things: 1. It gets you toasty enough to sweat, and 2. It gets you resting (a crucial aspect of healing, as stated above).</p>\n<p>-Sleep</p>\n<p>As previously mentioned, sleep is vital to healing in all aspects of the body. One of the best things you can do for yourself during a cold or the flu is to rest and sleep.</p>\n<p>-Garlic, Cayenne, Cinnamon, and Cloves</p>\n<p>Garlic is a natural antibiotic and antiviral. It can reduce the severity of a cold and possibly lessen the time it takes to heal. It may be hard to handle, but the best way to utilize garlic would be to mince it up and drink it in water. If you can&#8217;t handle that, find some really good, high-quality garlic tablets.</p>\n<p>Cayenne, Cinnamon, and Cloves</p>\n<p>These warming herbs help break up mucous. They have long been touted as natural remedies for coughs and colds. Stir these into an herbal tea and drink up!</p>\n<p>-Coconut oil</p>\n<p>Coconut oil is a miracle! It is anti-viral, anti-fungal, and anti-bacterial! There is literally nothing I can think of that coconut oil is not good for! Contrary to the rumors of the past, coconut oil is not fattening or bad for you. In fact, it is quite the opposite! For more on the miracle of coconut see the book &#8216;<a href=\"http://http://www.amazon.com/Coconut-Miracle-Previously-published-Healing/dp/1583332049/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1358809784&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+coconut+oil+miracle\" target=\"_blank\">The Coconut Oil Miracle&#8217; by Dr. Bruce Fife</a>.</p>\n<p>-Apple Cider Vinegar</p>\n<p>A teaspoon of ACV in warm water can be gargled to help a sore throat. ACV aslo has a reputation for being anti-viral and anti-bacterial.</p>\n<p>-Steam (especially with herbs)</p>\n<p>Steam, and specifically herbal facial steams, can be good for clearing up congestion. Just boil some water, turn off the heat, add some herbs like rosemary, thyme, and eucalyptus, stir, cover for about 5-6 minutes, remove lid, drape a towel over your head, and lean over the pot. Breathe in the steam. It can loosen your congestion and kill bacteria.</p>\n<p>-Use a humidifier</p>\n<p>Often, dry air is a real problem during cold and flu season. Prevent drying out of the respiratory system by using a humidifier. I do have to say, though, make sure you keep the humidifier full, and that it is the right size for your room!</p>\n<p>-Hydration</p>\n<p>Make sure you stay hydrated during a cold or flu. Fluids are important to keep the immune system working well!</p>\n<p>-Use hydrogen peroxide</p>\n<p>For earaches and clogged ears, you can put a few drops in the ear. Lean over and let the peroxide bubble. Then turn over and repeat on the other side. You can also add a capful to your bath. This will permeate the skin and help ward off bacteria.</p>\n<p>-Neti Pot</p>\n<p>Use a neti pot with CLEAN water (distilled or boiled then cooled) and sea salt to clean mucous from the sinuses.</p>\n<p>There are many, many more natural remedies for preventing and healing colds and the flu. I hope this blog has helped you find some that you feel comfortable with! If you do the things on this list, you should help yourself prevent and heal much better and faster than ever! It all comes down to eating well, sleeping well, and caring for yourself! Trust me, this is MUCH better than just masking the underlying cause! Do these things, and you may find you get sick much less than anyone around you! I know I did!!</p>\n<p>References</p>\n<p>Kresser, C. (2011, Dec. 2). How to prevent colds and flus naturally.

It is important to have good health in the mental aspects as well as the physical aspects. Exercise can help aid in creating this wholeness. On that note, I would like to say that I believe that the mind-body connection is one of co-existence. What I mean by that is that, not only does exercise contribute to the well-being of mental and physical aspects, but the process of going through what is right or wrong for one person or another can assist in developing a deeper understanding of where that person is at and connecting that to the person&#8217;s future.</p>\n<p>For example, say Jane wanted to start an exercise routine. First, she would determine why she wants to do this. Say the first goal here is to lose some body fat. Jane wants to initially shed excess pounds, so she hires a personal trainer. This personal trainer does a thorough consultation with Jane, in which Jane discovers that she is not sure how she feels about herself in this moment. This leads Jane and her personal trainer to connect to a deeper level of thought. Now Jane has to figure out how she feels, what she hopes to accomplish in the near and far future, and how her goals might be achieved. This is the beginning of the mind-body connection. Throughout the process, if Jane is open enough to understanding that her mental and physical aspects relate to one another, Jane becomes more aware of herself and begins to lose that fat. In return, Jane not only gets a physical achievement, but a mental one as well. Her mind and body have connected. One feeds off of the other.</p>\n", "post_id": 60, "location": false, "date": "02-25-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["allergies", "treating allergies", "natural remedies", "healing", "mold", "seasonal allergies", "Cold;flu;natural remedies;prevention;health;vitamins;minerals;herbs;homeopathic remedies;food"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://alternefit.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/allergies-copy.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image aligncenter\" id=\"i-979\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://alternefit.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/allergies-copy.jpg?w=387&#038;h=288\" width=\"387\" height=\"288\" /></a>If there&#8217;s anything that I am all to familiar with, it&#8217;s seasonal allergies. I have suffered from both hay fever and winter mold allergies. This constant barrage of problems has led me to seek out all kinds of allergy remedies I could do at home. I must say, I have found some very helpful things. Today, I am going to share some of my remedies (and some that others have sworn by). I recommend you experiment a little to find what works for you, but keep in mind not to use too many things at once. You want to really know what works and what is useless for you. You also don&#8217;t want to take a chance mixing too many things at once because some things may not interact well with others. Keep in mind, I am not a doctor, and none of this should be used in lieu of medical advice. If you do want some DIY remedies, though, the following are my choices.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><strong>First and foremost, remove offending foods</strong></em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>So many people don&#8217;t realize that what they eat can affect every part of their bodies. This includes the immune system (a key system in fighting allergies). Removing foods that contain histamines and trigger the histamine response is a key in alleviating allergies. So, what are these foods. They include grains, alcohol (wine and cider too&#8230;yes, I know&#8230;that sucks, but it&#8217;s a fact. These contain histamines.), pasteurized dairy, high fructose corn syrup (HFCS), hydrogenated oils (vegetable, soy, and other highly processed oils), and chemical preservatives. All of these &#8216;foods&#8217; (and I say that in quotes because I don&#8217;t believe these truly are FOODS) are highly inflammatory, They affect gut health in a negative way, which, in turn, affects your immune system in a negative way. Remove these, and you can begin to heal the gut, which begins the rest of the body&#8217;s healing as well.</p>\n<p>One issue that I do want to briefly mention is that some other foods may need to be eliminated depending on situation. Those suffering from issues with ragweed, for example, may need to eliminate raw pollen-producing plants, such as bananas or cantaloupes (Ebeling, 2011). Other raw plants to avoid for ragweed issues would include melon, banana, cucumber, sunflower seeds, chamomile, and echinacea. For those with grass allergies, one might avoid raw celery, oranges, apples, tomatoes, peaches, sugar, and bananas (St. Pierre, 2012).</p>\n<p>According to Mark Sisson (2010) &#8220;if you know the source of your particular allergy, you can further pinpoint foods that tend to trigger what\u2019s called \u201coral allergy syndrome,\u201d a reaction to allergen-related foods that affects primarily the lips and mouth.&#8221;</p>\n<div>Read more about that here: <a href=\"http://www.chop.edu/service/allergy/allergy-and-asthma-information/oral-allergy-syndrome.html\">http://www.chop.edu/service/allergy/allergy-and-asthma-information/oral-allergy-syndrome.html</a></div>\n<p>Before I go further into the other ways to help eliminate seasonal allergies, let me just side step here for a minute. Since I am talking about healing the gut, I thought I&#8217;d explain a little about what I mean and how this works.</p>\n<p>- Gut dysbiosis, in simple terms, is when &#8216;bad bacteria&#8217; in the gut are more predominant than the &#8216;good bacteria.&#8217; You can contribute to this situation by eating the above offending foods or food-like substances, and not eating healthy, live foods like fermented foods, vegetables, fish, and meat.</p>\n<p>- Another way to create problems in the gut is by ingesting grains containing gluten or foods you may be intolerant to. These can cause damage to the gut lining, and allow for substances to cross the gut barriers that are there to protect you. This can create an immune response that triggers your allergies.</p>\n<p>- Digestion is important in immunity. When the digestive system is not functioning properly (for reasons such as low stomach acid or other such issues), it prevents the body from properly responding. The immune response can be triggered just by having something like low stomach acid (which is the cause of heartburn, by the way&#8230;really&#8230;it is. I&#8217;ll explain this in a future blog).</p>\n<p>- Every system in the body is tied to one another. When one is sick, the other systems are likely to also be sick. One example of this would be your liver. When the gut has problems constantly, the liver has to work overtime. This means the pathogens the liver would be removing are likely escaping into the bloodstream, causing the immune system to function poorly. Thus, allergies persist.</p>\n<p>- If you have mold allergies, know that molds interact with sugar and wheat. Removing these will create an environment less appealing to them. That means the molds are less likely to take over in the body!</p>\n<p>Many times, people have found that removing offending foods and food-like substances from their diets can be the first step to healing their guts. This gut healing improves overall system healing&#8230;and that means less chance of allergies!</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><strong>Add foods that will boost the immune system and fight for you</strong></em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to removing offending foods, adding foods to help you boost your immune system will help you rid yourself of those pesky allergies. There are many, many foods that will help do this. In the following list, I have included some of them, along with their helpful effects:</p>\n<p>- Fermented foods such as kombucha, kvass, grass-fed, raw yogurt and kefir, and sauerkraut (look out for this last one, though&#8230;sometimes sauerkraut can actually create a histamine response). These foods help heal the gut and produce a healthy whole-body system.They do this because these foods are natural probiotics, meaning they increase the numbers of &#8216;good bacteria&#8217; in the gut, thereby surpassing those &#8216;bad&#8217; buggers.</p>\n<p>- People who have low levels of zinc have been found to have more allergy troubles. Increasing your intake in shitakii and cremini mushrooms, spinach, asparagus, green leafy vegetables, and healthy meats such as grass-fed beef and lamb will boost your levels of zinc, thus increasing your ability to fight allergies.</p>\n<p>- Quercetin, a bioflavenoid found in onions, capers, broccoli, leafy greens, cranberries, apples, and\u00a0raspberries, peppers, and other brightly colored fruits and veggies, can stabilize the immune system and strengthen mucous membranes (Ebeling, 2011). Eating these vegetables will help fight the excessive histamines (Carrasco, 2012).</p>\n<p>- If your allergies bring weeziness and trouble breathing, try upping magnesium rich foods such as green leafy vegetables. The magnesium in these can help your breathing.</p>\n<p>- Anti-inflammatory foods are also something you should be consuming. These foods will, as the name implies, help reduce inflammation in the body. They include wild caught fish and grass-fed beef.</p>\n<p>- Green tea, red tea, and white tea all contain a flavenoid that some say helps with allergies. These help by reducing inflammation and support the immune system at the same time.</p>\n<p>- Foods high in Omega 3s, Vitamin A, and Vitamin C will also help during allergy season. Walnuts, grass-fed meats, wild caught fish, broccoli, bell peppers, and eggs are all good choices for these nutrients that are needed to fight allergies and stay healthy. Consume a good amount of these foods, and you should be able to boost immunity!</p>\n<p>- Garlic is a go-to for me. It helps with colds, flus, and allergies. It&#8217;s also been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties, so you can see why it would help!</p>\n<p>- Many people have sworn by local, raw honey as a remedy for their seasonal allergies. The idea behind it is that the pollens within the honey enter your system and act in the way that an allergy shot would. These pollens essentially adapt your system to the local pollens that might otherwise become a problem. During hay fever season, I will often get some raw, local honey from my local honeybee guild or farmers and take a teaspoon of it daily or every other day. I think it does help a bit with hay fever, but it does nothing for mold allergies.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><strong>Reduce stress and relax</strong></em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ever notice your allergies acting up more when you&#8217;re stressed or tired? I know I have! Believe it or not, allergies can be affected by stress and sleep. If you are under stress or don&#8217;t get enough sleep, your immune system is stimulated by the release of cytokines, which are pro-inflammatory (Carrasco, 2012). In order to prevent this from happening, try getting at least 8 hours of sleep and doing a relaxation technique such as meditation.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><strong>Think about products you are using </strong></em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We might often think about the foods we do and don&#8217;t eat, but sometimes we don&#8217;t think about the products we are using. Yes, it is true that household products, make-ups, hair products, and other such products are often filled with allergy producing chemicals and substances. If you begin learning what is in the products you use, you can begin to rid yourself of those chemicals and substances that induce allergies. Try switching to more natural products, but be careful there too. Some natural products, while &#8216;natural&#8217; can still can contain allergens. Know what the products consist of and know how those ingredients affect you.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><strong>Supplements</strong></em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I prefer getting my nutrients from food; however, I have found some supplementation helps fight seasonal allergies. These are mostly in the form of herbs and homeopathic remedies. Some examples and their benefits follow:</p>\n<p>- Vitamin C: A natural antihistamine. Taken in a bit larger doses than is typically common for you, Vitamin C can boost the immune system and block histamine.</p>\n<p>- Ginger: Ginger can reduce swelling in the glands and air passages. That is why it works so well for colds and the flu. It can also work well for mold allergy reduction.</p>\n<p>- Wild Oregano and Olive Leaf Extract: These are anti-fungal herbs. Using them can kill of the mold, but they should also be used with caution. You don&#8217;t want to use too much of a tincture of either, for they can be toxic in larger doses.</p>\n<p>- Echinacea: This calming herb is often used to treat colds and flus. It can boost the immune system and help the bronchial tracts clear for better breathing. This herb is often good for mold allergies as well as hay fever.</p>\n<p>- Nettle: Yes, the stinging nettle plant can be used for allergies. It seems counter-intuitive since nettle is commonly considered a weed, but it&#8217;s true. In fact, this weed has often been considered better than many hay fever medicines! It can relieve itching and sneezing from allergies. To use nettle, you can take freeze dried capsules at 300 mg when symptoms are experienced. This will relieve you for around 4 hours. You can also make a tincture or tea with nettle. To make the tea, just boil the nettle leaves. Add peppermint for a tasty allergy reliever!</p>\n<p>- Goldenseal: This herb has often been used for colds and the flu. It can flush out the passageways and act as an astringent. You can get goldenseal as a capsule, dried herb, or a tincture. Probably the fastest and best way to take it is in tincture form. Just a few drops added to nettle tea will really help the allergies subside!</p>\n<p>- Finally, I have to mention that I have used some homeopathic remedies for seasonal allergies. You can find these at most health food stores such as Whole Foods Market or Central Market. Look for the &#8216;blue tube&#8217; stand in the herbs and minerals section of the store. These are literally blue tubes. They are homeopathic mixtures for a variety of ailments, and they have helped me in the past. Click<a href=\"http://www.boironusa.com/category/symptoms/symptoms-allergy/\"> here</a> to visit the <a href=\"http://www.boironusa.com/\">Boiron Blue Tube website</a> and learn more.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><strong>A Sinus Rinse</strong></em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>As with colds and the flu, a sinus rinse may help clear nasal passages during allergy season. Using a neti-pot with CLEAN (distilled or boiled and cooled) water and sea salt will help clean out mucous.</p>\n<p>Well folks, that&#8217;s it! I think there are plenty of good remedies here to get you started to healing your body and taking charge of your own seasonal allergies! I know each of these remedies has been of help to me!</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>References:</p>\n<p>Carrasco, A. (2012, Oct. 27). 6 ways to relieve allergies naturally.

I was sitting here trying to figure out what I could title this blog so that people might want to take a gander at it&#8230;sooo, I looked up the combination of &#8220;metal songs and nutrition.&#8221; Guess what the first song up was? WALK by PANTERA! How ironically funny is that? Of course, the search engine is probably used to my own general choices so that is the first thing that I got&#8230;but this prompted me to ask&#8230;&#8221;What songs do you think go hand-in-hand with your lifestyle and health or fat-loss?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Hence&#8230;I changed the subject of this blog&#8230;for now!</p>\n<p>Being someone that loves to learn and grow, I often work-out and listen to scientific nutrition and fitness podcasts. I also listen to these while I am at work as well as when I am cooking. I&#8217;ll be honest, I am immersed in this nutrition and fitness research world. Not only do I listen to the podcasts, but I read the blogs, research, and websites that people often reference. I LIVE for the research and knowledge about it. I do it so that YOU do not HAVE to unless you WANT to! I try to portray a balance in what I learn and understand, but I want to stress that you should even question me!</p>\n<p>But, I digress&#8230;this blog&#8230;for now&#8230;is about the music related to the knowledge!</p>\n<p>Since I spend my time listening to experts talk while I research what they say and do, I wonder&#8230;what gets you going? What do all of you listen to when you play, work-out, cook, work, and just have fun? I would love to know if anyone has suggestions about some good songs about food?</p>\n<p>I can say&#8230;there are varying beliefs. I don&#8217;t necessarily subscribe to any one particular for any one individual&#8230;.BUT (yes, there is a but) I think that the song should not push a belief.</p>\n<p>One song I remember I loved during my teenage angsty years of misguided vegetarianism (no offense&#8230;I back my own ideas upon science and research only) is Citizen Fish&#8217;s song, &#8216;Sacred Cows.&#8217; Of course, this appeals to punk rockers, veggies, vegans, and alternative folks. No troubles and a serious message&#8230;BUT (again, that but)&#8230;I don&#8217;t subscribe to that&#8230;for myself or for health, really&#8230;while I used to, I have obviously changed after really understanding the research.</p>\n<p>So, again, I ask&#8230;what songs do you think of when you think of nutrition/fitness? Think Pantera-esque musique! Look, one of those top rated songs was WALK by PANTERA! Another was ACE OF SPADES by MOTORHEAD! This is cool, in my opinion&#8230;I could surely cook a healthy meal and work out to these songs&#8230;let alone the dancing and partying!</p>\n<p>Anyway, I think it is important to combine the two&#8230;and I think many do&#8230;but my job is to get you interested in the idea that the two can be fun and work&#8230;it is my job to get you looking good while simultaneously having fun&#8230;and I do it&#8230;so I know you can too!</p>\n<p>What do you think?</p>\n<p>What is your passion?</p>\n<p>What is your song?</p>\n<p>What is your band?</p>\n<p>What appeals to you?</p>\n<p>Who really ever asks you these questions in consideration to your life?</p>\n<p>I hope to hear from MANY of you!</p>\n<p>Until then, Have a Healthy Day!</p>\n<p>Rachel</p>\n", "post_id": 69, "location": false, "date": "03-11-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["cancer", "primal", "sensitivity", "ADHD", "Tips", "alternative", "paleo", "menu", "poison", "American diet", "low-GI", "low-GL", "toxin", "work-out", "exercise", "Diabetes", "nutrition", "Western diet", "gluten", "fat loss", "diet", "water", "ADD", "low-carb", "vegan", "auto-immune", "lifestyle", "health and wellness", "crohn's disease", "vegetarian", "celiac", "fitness", "Chronic Illness", "Autism"], "text": "<p>Today I am going to discuss several key ideas to help you lose fat and gain health. There are so many sources out there that contradict each other. Sometimes it is hard to decipher what is what and who is really accurate.</p>\n<p>I can tell you I certainly have no problem with people chosing to believe something different. I have no problem with different choices or decisions. I also have no problem with people seeking out resources that back what they choose. I do, however, hope that many of you will take what I have to say into consideration. My own belief is based on science and research as well. I listen to a number of experts discuss issues such as diabetes, obesity, and other nutrtion-related issues. I have read numerous studies by a number of professionals. My own practice is based on this.</p>\n<p>So, without further ado, some of the key facts for your health are as follows:</p>\n<p>1. In order to begin losing fat and gaining a balanced system, eat less carbohydrates, more protein, and even more healthy saturated fats.</p>\n<p>2. Healthy fats include saturated fats in avocados, coconut oil, grass-fed meats, and wild-caught fish.</p>\n<p>3. Eat less foods with Omega-6 fatty acids and more foods with Omega-3 fatty acids. This means eat liver products from things such as fish or grass-fed animals. Stop eating grains and processed foods. They will contain more Omega-6s.</p>\n<p>4. Stop eating fructose. This means High Fructose Corn Syrup AND fruit fructose. Of course, many might say&#8230;&#8221;but we&#8217;ve always been told fruit is a healthy snack.&#8221; Yes, in very limited moderation&#8230;and when you eat the right kinds. LIMIT those containing high amounts of carbohydrates and fructose like bananas and apples. LIMIT those that are high in sweet and citrus such as oranges. DO eat some berries&#8230;these contain many antioxidants and are lower in fructose.</p>\n<p>5. Stop eating processed foods. This one should be obvious. Processed food is not really food at all if you think about it. I mean, why do those frozen dinners have an ingredient list that reads like a chemistry experiment? Because&#8230;essentially, it IS a chemistry experiment. In order to make the food last for transport and shelf-life, they remove fiber. Then, they have to add something to make it taste good. What do they normally add? FRUCTOSE or SOMETHING SIMILAR. So, basically, they remove the healthy\u00a0product out of the food because they want money. Then, they add in the unhealthy product to make the food taste good again&#8230;because food without the fiber agents would just taste like cardboard. Food additives do as the name applies&#8230;ADD in something to mask or mock the flavor.</p>\n<p>7. Remove soy and corn from your diet: These foods are just not good for you. Soy is not a health food. It is actually a toxin. Unless it is fermented (the way our friends suffering in Japan right now usually\u00a0traditionally ate\u00a0their SMALL amounts), it is extremely bad for the body. These two products are also most likely to be GMOs (genetically modified organisms&#8230;aka: foods made by a lab&#8230;usually created from &#8220;Round-Up Ready Seeds&#8221; that Monsanto has forced down people&#8217;s throats (literally). Yes, that is the same Round-Up that you spray on weeds to kill them&#8230;a toxic substance&#8230;a poison!</p>\n<p>8. Cut out gluten. I cannot stress how many people may very well have issues with this product! Many do not even realize it, but they are having reactions to it. Even if you have gotten tested for gluten sensitivity in the past and the test has come back negative, there is still a great risk that you have gluten reactions that don&#8217;t show in most tests. Cutting this out will actually show you how much it is commonly misunderstood. If you cut this out, you might find you have less problems with gut, auto-immune issues, nervous system issues, and more!</p>\n<p>9. Just stop with the toxic substance called ASPARTAME! This means NO artificial sweeteners&#8230;NO DIET drinks&#8230;instead, try STEVIA. If you absolutely MUST have a soda, there is one called ZEVIA that you can find online and at Whole Paycheck (uh, I mean Foods). It is sweetened with Zevia, is 0 kcalories, and has none of that icky bad stuff in it! I have tried it, and it is quite tasty. Even Bob liked it!</p>\n<p>10. Here is a sample of a meal that should be good for everyone, but is most definitely good for lowering risk of diabetes. It may also help you lose fat quickly and effortlessly due to the insulin reaction in the body (a very scientific process that I hope to illustrate for you after my birthday):</p>\n<p>This meal might sound like breakfast, but you can eat it anytime. I just did the other day:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2 Grass-fed pastured eggs cooked however you want in clarified butter or grass-fed butter (don&#8217;t be afraid to use a lot or to use what real butter you need&#8230;even if it is not clarified or grass-fed, it is still better than those nasty hydrogenated products)</li>\n<li>Several Pieces of Nitrite and Nitrate free Bacon (mine was turkey, but you can use whichever kind you want&#8230;and don&#8217;t be afraid to make a lot of it, either. Also, it tastes yummy to cook this with some coconut oil in the pan)</li>\n<li>1/2 a Large Avocado</li>\n<li>Scoop of Grass-fed Goat Cheese (if you have auto-immune issues or problems with dairy, avoid this product)</li>\n<li>1 Leaf of Organic Green-Leaf Lettuce</li>\n<li>1/2 Glass Almond Milk (unsweetened)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That seems like a large list, right? Not really. It might be a long list, but if you break it down, it is not really much&#8230;and it is filling! You can walk away from this meal feeling satiated. It should also last you quite a while&#8230;and it won&#8217;t spike your blood sugar as much as a ton of carbohydrates will.</p>\n<p>Simply, if you eat whole foods that you cook and make sure you do lower carbohydrates (preferably no processed ones and mostly carbs from veggies), moderate protein, and high saturated fat, you should get really great health and fat-loss results. You should have plenty of energy and less chance of insulin reaction as well!</p>\n<p>If you feel like you don&#8217;t have time to always cook, try cooking a lot of stuff at one time then saving the rest. I do this. I will cook an entire package of meat and put most of it in the fridge for a couple of days. This will be my lunch or dinner for those days I just don&#8217;t have time to cook something or don&#8217;t feel like it. If you don&#8217;t like left-over type foods like this, try freezing it after you cook it&#8230;then, it could be sort of like a frozen dinner. Of course, heating it up still might not do it justice like the fresh meal&#8230;but it is a convenient and pretty tasty way to get a better meal.</p>\n<p>Healthy snacks can include things like jerky (nitrite and nitrate free), berries (a small amount), LIMITED dried fruit (I prefer dried mango. Be careful to only get the unsulfered kind&#8230;or dry the fruit yourself&#8230;you don&#8217;t need the added sugar of the store brands&#8230;let alone all the other processed things in that), and a handful of nuts (raw&#8230;not peanuts&#8230;those are legumes not nuts). I like macadamias but I can say from experience that you absolutely CAN overdo it. Just grab a handful.</p>\n<p>Finally, DRINK GOOD WATER. Now, most tap water has some nasty stuff in it and added to it&#8230;so try a water filter to help&#8230;or choose your favorite spring water (many people will warn about the plastic bottles putting out chemicals, but my concern is more on what is in other water rather than the minute things a plastic bottle might cause).</p>\n<p>AND&#8230;</p>\n<p>WALK, LIFT HEAVY THINGS SOMETIMES, and SPRINT OCCASIONALLY.</p>\n<p>Ok, ok, if you don&#8217;t like to sprint, try dancing or something you do like&#8230;but not for long periods of time&#8230;I&#8217;m talking small little bursts&#8230;like 30 seconds followed by walking for 2 minutes&#8230;then 30 seconds again&#8230;and so on for about 20 to 30 minutes!</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s it! If you try some of these suggestions, you should begin to notice results within a few days or so&#8230;it may be just a few or it may be a month&#8230;but it WILL help&#8230;I promise!</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll post more on the insulin reaction after my birthday.

I know, it is main-stream media&#8230;and that means it may usually cater to the &#8220;common knowledge&#8221; approaches&#8230;but have you ever wondered what really happens to these poor people that go through the programs that may cause more harm than good?</p>\n<p>There are a number of these shows on TV now, and I do use my DVR for a lot of them. One in particular is really getting my goat, though. It is a show called &#8220;Too Fat for 15.&#8221; This show focuses on families that have one kid in his or her teens that is obese or morbidly obese. The kid goes to a camp/rehab-type school for part of the year. In this school, the kid gets the standard classes, but also gets a fitness, nutrtition, and counseling aspect. That sounds all fine and dandy, right? Wrong! It would be great if the kid got the proper real-world training in these areas; however, the focus is once again on types of nutrition and fitness that focus on the calories in vs. calories out theory that is just not feasible in most people&#8217;s lives.</p>\n<p>Let me give you an example:</p>\n<p>In one episode, the kids and their families had a family day which consisted of a school outing to a restaurant. This restaurant seemed to be a burger-type joint kinda like Twisted Root. The burgers and salads seemed quality, but there was a lot of temptation for choosing not-so-healthy choices. What do I mean by that? Well, there were fries and buns. There seemed to be some dessert choices. Options for no sugar were available&#8230;they were tea and ASPARTAME laden sweeteners! Uggh! So, what did the facilitators suggest the kids get? Salad with little to no dressing, no OLIVE OIL, a bit of vinegar maybe, no AVOCADO! In fact, my jaw dropped when one person from the facility stated that AVOCADO was a BAD TEMPTATION FOOD for these kids! Uggh! Ok, before I go ANY further with this, I do have to say that AVOCADO is AN EXCELLENT fat source! It is not the fat that makes one FAT! How many scientists, doctors, and researchers have to say this before the main-stream nutrition &#8220;experts&#8221; understand it? What IS bad? Well, let&#8217;s see&#8230;how about the CARBOHYDRATES and PROCESSED FOODS in that burger bun? How about the ASPARTAME in that tea? On that note, guess what was available to these kids at the facility itself?! You got it, ARTIFICIAL SWEETENER&#8230;and I doubt it was STEVIA! The kids were piling it on their already sugar-laden fruits! The facility also had pasta and sandwiches! What?! Really! NOT really beneficial foods, I&#8217;d say.</p>\n<p>Now, before I go off on a gigantic tirade about that, I want to focus on what the kids have to do for fitness! These kids exercise sooooo much during their stay. The show never really says how long they go in their exercise classes, and it only really shows some of the things they do&#8230;some of which I completely agree needs to be done; HOWEVER (there&#8221;s that word again), a mile run is NOT necessary or particularly healthy&#8230;especially if the kid is obese and has not done this! They do allow them to walk when they need to, but they time the kids! I have to give them credit, because they do stick with the kids regardless&#8230;but again, running might do some serious damage to these kids! The cortisol levels would most definitely be way up for many of them&#8230;which becomes an issue with energy metabolism in the body! That could contribute to the kids NOT losing weight!</p>\n<p>One thing they do that I do like is that they have this semi-boot-camp-style day where the kids are doing a lot of natural movement that is beneficial. It is also done mostly outside&#8230;which is nice because it gives the kids that Vitamin D and necessary &#8220;outside in the wild&#8221; air that they should be getting for health and fat-loss (it is in a pretty awesome looking wooded area). I do like that.</p>\n<p>Now, my final point on all of this is that the types of things the facility in this show touts are just not things that one kid could really feasibly stick to in real-life. I mean, do you see these kids and their (usually also unhealthy) families eating dry salads all the time? Do you see them sticking to minute portions of unhealthy foods&#8230;as long as the calories are down? Not likely. They might find themselves in real-life going on to eat the same foods, but with a drawback&#8230;larger portions and processed stuff on or with them! Why do they not teach a whole foods, lower carb, higher fat, moderate protein approach? Why, if not anything else, do they not teach the idea of cutting out FRUCTOSE, SUGAR, ASPARTAME, and JUNK? Why don&#8217;t they teach the kids that simply making choices of good, fresh foods such as wild-caught fish, grass-fed meats, and green veggies can be yummy? Why not avocado, coconut, olive oil, and no fruit? Why? I suppose it is because they are ignorant to the reality of health and wellness. I suppose it has been taught to them and it is the gullible leading the gullible! It makes no sense to me to teach someone to eat poor quality foods and exercise umpteen hours a day so that they regain control of their weight and health. Why not focus on making sure the kids understand how sleep, stress, whole foods, staying away from processed crap, and basic walking and resistance training can slim them down, get them healthy, and prepare them for a way better life? If they touted this, there would be far less obesity to deal with&#8230;hence there would be less worry in families and society about the diseases associated with all of this! And I guess that is why, right? Because drugs and food companies rule this nation&#8230;and why would they care about people getting healthy? It would make them lose money&#8230;hey, do you think that facility would go under if they did it right? Well, if they got wise maybe they would have many others to help for quite a while&#8230;heck, it&#8217;s an epidemic, right? I don&#8217;t see the facility going out of business any time even in the far future if they had great results that people could stick with&#8230;maybe not the same clients&#8230;but there would be new ones for many years to come! So, my guess&#8230;big medicine and big food run the facility and the show!</p>\n<p>What say you?</p>\n<p>Oh, and before I go&#8230;one more issue: They actually said on the show that &#8220;the scale never lies!&#8221; Do they really go by this at that facility?! HOW ABSURD! Any smart trainer and nutrtion expert knows that weighing is just NOT the way to accurately assess fat loss! Weight is a minor aspect&#8230;yes, I think there should be checks here and there&#8230;but honestly, the best way to tell is to pay attention to how the body feels and looks&#8230;maybe using the clothes as a guide&#8230;if you are leaning out, you WILL begin to drop clothing sizes even if you don&#8217;t notice! Yes, I think the scale is good for the kids when they see that they have done well here and there&#8230;but it could lead to major problems&#8230;like obsessively checking weight, not realizing they are gaining lean muscle, or getting down when they don&#8217;t drop what they wanted! And yes, the scale CAN, DOES, and HAS lied! Is that really any healthy motto?! Really!</p>\n<p>Have a healthy day!</p>\n<p>Rachel</p>\n", "post_id": 84, "location": false, "date": "03-17-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["nutrition", "paleo", "T2DM", "primal", "Sisson", "Type II Diabetes", "Research", "low-GI", "low-carb", "health", "Type 2 Diabetes", "wellness", "low-GL", "Diabetes", "studies", "Pubmed"], "text": "<p>not real!</p>\n<p>But seriously, people. Are you interested in how you might &#8220;cure&#8221; or control for your diabetes? Let me help you out! Now, this won&#8217;t be a list, but it may well open you up to the idea that healthy choices do not have to be boring and non-rewarding! Those with Type II Diabetes Mellitus might want to really pay attention to some of the references I have listed. Some might contain difficult language, but that is why I am writing this blog&#8230;to help you understand what they say.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the rub:</p>\n<p>First, a high-carb, low-fat diet will NOT assist you in your quest to be T2DM-free. Carbohydrates essentially turn to sugar in the blood&#8230;that means that they give you exactly what you do not need!</p>\n<p>Second, the body does not work in such a way that it stores fat as fat&#8230;rather, it stores sugar as fat&#8230;this does not mean it is just storing that white powder or corn syrup as fat&#8230;rather, it means that the glucose contained in carbohydrates (along with those previously mentioned&#8230;you know, the corn syrup, the fructose, and the sucrose) is also being contained as FAT! This is a very simple explanation that really can get complicated. In fact, much of the sugars in carbohydrates lack the fibers that should be there to help the body control this complicated process (Sisson, 2010)&#8230;but I&#8217;m getting a bit ahead of the curve here&#8230;let me backtrack a bit first&#8230;</p>\n<p>Ok, so we know that carbohydrates (carbs) turn to glucose, right&#8230;so what?</p>\n<p>Well, glucose\u00a0 is a sugar and, in large amounts,\u00a0a toxin unless it is burned in the cells(Sisson, 2010). Because the body evolved to survive during famine or hunger-type states, the body stores this sugar to use as fuel in those times of need (Sisson, 2010). Instead of releasing it into the bloodstream, the body stores it in cells (Sisson, 2010). This is stored as glycogen by the liver and muscles (Sisson, 2010). Suddenly, after eating, the pancreas senses this large amount of glucose in the blood and sends out the insulin &#8220;guardians&#8221;. These guardians have the job of allowing fats, amino acids, and glucose to enter the gates of the kingdom&#8230;essentially the kindom of muscles and liver cells.</p>\n<p>Now, the thing is&#8230;the kindom of muscles and liver cells in an inactive person has one area that is full&#8230;.so what happens?</p>\n<p>Well, glucose gets converted&#8230;to saturated fat (Sisson, 2010).</p>\n<p>See, those nutrients are stored for famine&#8230;because we have not always had mass access to the food king as we do now.</p>\n<p>Sooo&#8230;what happens when a new glycogen tries to move in to an already crowded kingdom? Yes, the others fight back. What is the first defence? Yes, the insulin guardians! So these guys say, &#8220;Hey, there&#8217;s some new sugar trying to move in here! What now?&#8221; and the kingdom says &#8220;Uh, no way, Jose!&#8221; So, the areas where the glucose can be allowed into the kingdom become limited. Therefore, the glucose stays outside the gates&#8230;in the bloodstream. This causes a problem, though. Now the pancreas is noticing how many glucose are still floating around outside the muscle and liver cell kingdom. It thinks there is a need for more guardians for the kingdom&#8230;so it sends out more insulin guardians. Now, there is a full-on battle going on all due to a miscommunication (isn&#8217;t it always)&#8230;See, the guardians are trying to say &#8220;Hey, we&#8217;re full up. Go somewhere else.&#8221; The kingdom is saying &#8220;Get away now! Why are you fighting! We will not allow you!&#8221; but the pancreas thinks the glucose are just attacking and getting through&#8230;so it sends more guardians, which causes more resistance, which becomes toxic! Finally, the insulin guardians come to a conclusion&#8230;they realize that the glucose can go to a camp just inside the kingdom and be stored there for emergency. This compromise begets the storage of sugar in fat cells&#8230;hence, sugar is stored as fat! Get it?</p>\n<p>Ok&#8230;now if we break this down, it looks like this:<a href=\"http://alternefit.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/insulinbattle.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-94\" title=\"insulinbattle\" src=\"https://alternefit.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/insulinbattle.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a></p>\n<p>Man eats glucose-loaded carbohydrates (a macronutrient of over-consumption).</p>\n<p>Glucose knocks on the kingdom gates.</p>\n<p>Kingdom says &#8220;Uhhh..no, we&#8217;re full&#8221;</p>\n<p>Glucose sits there outside the gates</p>\n<p>Insulin is sent to protect the kingdom.</p>\n<p>Pancreas thinks the insulin is having a hard time so sends back-up.</p>\n<p>Back-up creates more communication mishaps.</p>\n<p>Finally, insulin decides the glucose can be stored in fat cells.</p>\n<p>More carbs are consumed, and cycle is repeated&#8230;causing overcrowding over and over again.</p>\n<p>Insulin resistance occurs.</p>\n<p>Overcrowding in the cells creates more havoc within the kingdom.</p>\n<p>Pollution becomes a problem inside and out of the kingdom and cells.</p>\n<p>Muscle kingdom does not get any\u00a0necessary glycogen\u00a0due to resistance.</p>\n<p>Insulin inhibits lipase (fat-burning enzyme) (Sisson, 2010).</p>\n<p>Since Sir Lipase is not working at full capacity, he cannot help burn fat.</p>\n<p>The cells of fat become resistant to themselves!</p>\n<p>Pancreas thinks more warriors are needed since the other insulin cannot win.</p>\n<p>More insulin is sent&#8230;and the kingdom becomes toxic.</p>\n<p>There is a build-up in the arterie halls of the kingdom.</p>\n<p>Other nutrients cannot enter the kingdom anymore because it is all out war! This means amino acids (the great facilitators of the kingdom) cannot even get in!</p>\n<p>Now, the rest of the kingdom thinks that there is a famine, so they cannibalize (Sisson, 2010&#8230;sort of).</p>\n<p>Since the cannibalization happens, the muscle kingdom goes slowly away.</p>\n<p>Now, there is less energy in the kingdom.</p>\n<p>This makes the inhabitors hungry for more&#8230;so they send signals to get more carbs&#8230;and when the carbs come a knockin&#8230;.</p>\n<p>well&#8230;</p>\n<p>The Ultimate King Liver is affected&#8230;it is now resistant to it all. It is &#8220;fed&#8221; or &#8220;un-fed&#8221; up! It can no longer regulate the T4 magician into the T3 magician&#8230;and now&#8230;thyroid is affected!</p>\n<p>Mr. Thyroid then says, &#8220;Hey, uh, metabolism&#8230;I&#8217;m not seeing T3, you had better slow down!&#8221;</p>\n<p>So&#8230;yes, metabolism slows down.</p>\n<p>Huhhh&#8230;the battle continues&#8230;those darn glucose and other sugars begin to exhaust and destroy the entire kingdom&#8230;from gate to point! The nerve gates get damaged and can&#8217;t feel or experience phantom pains&#8230;the retinol gates hurt and eyesight is dimenished&#8230;and finally&#8230;King Pancreas gives up! He is exhausted. He just stops sending the insulin warriors and can&#8217;t do it anymore&#8230;now, you have to inject new ones to help him&#8230;and that, my friends, is T1DM!</p>\n<p>Thanks to Mark Sisson for his wonderful blog on this process!</p>\n<p>Here are some important links!</p>\n<p>References</p>\n<p>Doug.

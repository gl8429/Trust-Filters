Or a ted dy bear that was once a Valentine&#8217;s Day present? A wedding dress from a marriage gone awry? An axe that smashed through household furniture?<br />\nAll are on display at the Museum of Broken Relationships in the Croatian capital, each with written testimonies telling tales of passion, romance and heartbreak. On Valentine&#8217;s Day, the museum sees its visits almost double.</strong></p>\n<p>\u201cThe objects that are here represent all the stages of a breakup&#8230; and how people go through love,\u201c said Drazen Grubisic, a designer and artist who co-founded the museum in 2010. \u201cWe might say it&#8217;s a love museum, just upside down,\u201c he said.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The mementos -collected from all over the world -are random and varied, ranging from fake rubber breasts to a cast from a broken leg. Each item comes with dates and locations of the relationships, and notes by their anonymous donors.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some are funny. The note next to a garter belt says, \u201cI never put them on. The relationship might have lasted longer if I had.\u201c</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some are bitter. The garden gnome flew over a car driven by a husband who turned \u201carrogant and heartless.\u201c It bounced on the asphalt, shattering its face.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was a long loop, drawing an arc of time&#8230; that defined the end of love,\u201c the note from Slovenia said.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>An axe from Berlin was used by a woman to smash every piece of furniture her girlfriend had left behind. \u201cThe more the room filled with chopped furniture, (the more) I felt better.\u201c</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The text by a blue frisbee reads, \u201cDarling, should you ever get the ridiculous idea to walk into a cultural institution like a museum for the first time in your life, you&#8217;ll remember me.\u201c</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The museum, located just across from Zagreb&#8217;s City Hall where couples get married, currently displays some 100 \u201crelics\u201c out of about 1,000 that have been collected from around the world. Parts of the collection have travelled as far as Manila, London and Singapore to be put on display. In each city, the heartbroken can donate their stuff to the Zagreb museum.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A prosthetic leg currently showcased in England at the National Centre for Craft and Design, was donated by a war veteran who fell in love with his physical therapist. A note says it lasted longer than the relationship because it was made of \u201csturdier material.\u201c</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The museum itself is the brainchild of a breakup. When Grubisic and co-founder Olinka Vistica, a filmmaker, split up, they got stuck when it came to dividing their sentimental memorabilia. They didn&#8217;t want to just get rid of it, so they created a museum.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe sometime in your life you will want to remember some of the good parts of the relationship,\u201c Grubisic said.</p>\n<p><strong>He said that donors of mementos find the giving therapeutic. \u201cThey can move on,\u201c he said. \u201cThey also show there&#8217;s something universal: We all have been brokenhearted at least once.\u201c -AP<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(I couldn&#8217;t post it from its link I am so sorry ,tried a lot <a href=\"http://epaper.thehimalayantimes.com\u00a0\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://epaper.thehimalayantimes.com\u00a0</a> you can check out the news here)</p>\n", "post_id": 120, "location": false, "date": "02-15-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["thought", "culture", "moral", "time"], "text": "<p><img class=\"alignleft\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jimromenesko.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/polls_big_lie_logo_1__2443_41038_poll_xlarge.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"350\" height=\"300\" /></p>\n<p>Lying is wrong in any form, it\u2019s a moral rule we\u2019ve all been taught- a part of moral ethics of the world an underlying force of every religion, of humanity.</p>\n<p>\u201cLie\u201d saying false things to lead a person astray.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s said when a lie has a backing good reason is OK (how smart of you) whereas the same lie when spoken for evil situation/ wrong reason is incorrect (how could you!).</p>\n<p>How do we know this differentiation because I /all of us were told so by our elders or the heart thinks of a reason to determine \u201cour\u201d lie as FOR THE GOOD</p>\n<p>I have met a lot of people who say I don\u2019t lie but none actually don\u2019t.</p>\n<p>I too lie, do you?

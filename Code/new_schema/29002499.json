I am not really a &#8216;foodie&#8217; but I really hate being taken for a ride when I head out for a meal.</p>\n<p>My little list is far from exhaustive, but will give you an idea of what is available in Chamonix, whether you are a budget traveller or looking for a fine dining experience. For more resources (travel, food, shops, etc.), please have a look at our <a href=\"http://www.alpineinterface.com/alpstravellinks.php\">Alps Resource</a> page.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hameaualbert.fr/en/restaurant-chamonix-mont-blanc\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>La Maison Carrier</strong></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpineinterface.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/cremecaramel.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft\" alt=\"cremecaramel\" src=\"https://alpineinterface.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/cremecaramel.jpg?w=300&#038;h=224\" width=\"300\" height=\"224\" /></a></p>\n<p>The Maison Carrier is located opposite of ENSA (The national mountaineering school) and the main roundabout into Chamonix from Geneva, is a step down from the Albert 1er, Michelin stars and all, yet retains all of the charm and quality of one of the high-end eateries without all of the hype and fanfare found in more traditional French restaurants which are more concerned with protocol rather than what\u2019s in the plate.</p>\n<p>The building itself is worth the visit with old timbers, antique furniture and one of the last curing chimneys of the valley where, if you look up, you will see hams curing and smoked sausages, well, smoking. Serges, the Maitre d&#8217; is really the one who runs the show.<br />\nHis French accent is just the right mix of Jacques Cousteau and Jean Reno while still allowing you to understand what&#8217;s on the menu and which wines will go well with the meal.<br />\nI could\u00a0basically just have the dessert platter, which is a 2-tiered round table with roughly 30 different items to choose from.<br />\nSimply decadent but well worth it! They call it &#8220;<em> Vr\u00e9 de toutes les tartes de la Grand-M\u00e8re</em>, which translates to \u2018All of Grannie&#8217;s Goodies\u2019!<br />\nMenus range from the &#8216;plat du jour&#8217; (daily special) for \u20ac 19 to more elaborate feasts coming in at about \u20ac 40.<br />\nSerges is far from pushy when it comes to the wine list and will certainly suggest an excellent bottle for under \u20ac 25. The local <strong>Savoie</strong> wines are excellent, fruity and light and go well with most of the dishes on offer. <em>Bon appetit!</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.munchie.eu/\"><strong>Le Munchie Cuisine et Bar</strong></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpineinterface.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/salmon.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-241\" alt=\"salmon\" src=\"https://alpineinterface.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/salmon.jpg?w=300&#038;h=149\" width=\"300\" height=\"149\" /></a></p>\n<p>If you like fusion food, you will certainly enjoy this Swedish-run gem in the heart of Chamonix night-life, the Rue des Moulins, located just against the River Arve, parallel to the main pedestrian area of Chamonix.<br />\nHeavily into Sushi and Thai dishes with a twist, this is the perfect gig if you have just spent 10 days hiking the Alps eating cheese,<br />\nhard bread and iceberg lettuce.<br />\nSome of my favourites are their spicy beef salad, lobster tom yum and Tempura baby shrimp.<br />\nThey also offer daily specials. In summer, you can squeeze around the few tables they have directly in front of the restaurant but bring a jacket,<br />\neven on a warm summer&#8217;s night as the River Arve is rushing nearby bringing icy cold water from the many glaciers surrounding Chamonix.</p>\n<p>Remember to reserve, they are always busy! Despite no smoking bans in restaurants, terraces are not off limits to those who want a cigarette between courses so keep that in mind<br />\nif you choose to eat outside. Not cheap, so be prepared to spend close to \u20ac50 per person for food and drinks.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.lelapinagile.fr/6.html\"><strong>Le Lapin Agile</strong></a></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignleft\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.lelapinagile.fr/resources/_wsb_195x166_DSC_0013.JPG\" width=\"193\" height=\"165\" border=\"0\" hspace=\"0\" vspace=\"0\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpineinterface.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/lapin.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-269\" alt=\"lapin\" src=\"https://alpineinterface.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/lapin.jpg?w=195&#038;h=166\" width=\"195\" height=\"166\" /></a>Yes, the Agile Bunny is the name of this tiny wine bar just off the main road leading from<br />\nthe Chamonix train station.<br />\nAs it is run by a young Italian couple, who do not really adhere to strict opening and closing times,<br />\nit can at times be hit or miss.</p>\n<p>They are mainly a wine and tapas bar, choosing their wines personally\u00a0on numerous road trips during the off-season.</p>\n<p>The staff is very helpful and they serve the best coffee and hot chocolate in Chamonix, hands down.<br />\nIn the words of my daughter, &#8221;Daddy, this is the best hot chocolate in the world!!&#8221;<br />\nYou can literally put a spoon in it and it will stay up.</p>\n<p>Not much seating with just three or four tables outside, it is a perfect place to indulge in a great glass of wine and some tasty nibbles.</p>\n<p><strong>Aux</strong> <strong>Petits Gourmands</strong></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignleft\" id=\"HERO_PHOTO\" alt=\"Le magasin\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/6f/69/8d/filename-dsc00837-jpg.jpg\" width=\"244\" height=\"184\" /></p>\n<p>Located in the \u2018pedestrian zone\u2019 / main street across the Lafuma store and near Snell\u2019s Sporting goods,<br />\nthis high-end pastry and chocolate shop is one of the best in Chamonix for fast service,<br />\nexcellent food and a sunny terrace in the morning.</p>\n<p>Not cheap, but who\u2019s saving when on holiday?</p>\n<p>Their macaroons are also delicious and they can package almost anything to take away.<br />\nThis is a great place to read the paper, have a coffee and people watch as the caf\u00e9 is located on the main pedestrian street of Chamonix.</p>\n<p>If you need your fix of the Herald Tribune or another English-language paper, you can find it across the street<br />\nat the Maison de la Presse,near the Grand Hotel des Alpes, along with a huge selection of maps,<br />\nguide books and computer supplies downstairs.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hotelgustavia.eu/en/restaurant-chamonix/\"><b>Chambre 9 at the Hotel Gustavia</b></a></p>\n<p>Strategically located directly across the street from the Chamonix train station, the Chambre 9 is where the locals congregate for both lunch and apr\u00e8s-ski in the winter and for late evening meals in the summer. With a large, shaded terrace out front, the mostly Swedish staff are very efficient, courteous and the food is served fresh with a variety of dishes.

A visit to a cardiologist in order to have a stress test done will tell you exactly where you stand.</p>\n<p>If you have never undergone a training regime, I would strongly recommend contacting a personal trainer in order to create a training regime, which will be both productive and also safe. If you begin to work out and injure yourself straight away, your chances of enjoying a hike during the summer are pretty slim.</p>\n<p>Sadly, physical fitness takes a backseat to our other more pressing commitments such as raising children (I know, I have two little ones at home), work and careers and the stress of our modern, fast-paced societies. Many of you see hiking in the mountain ranges of the world as the perfect antidote to the rigours of life in the 21st Century. But we would like you to be prepared for what the trails and mountains have to offer, so you can actually enjoy them!</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_317\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://alpineinterface.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/nutrition.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-317\" alt=\"healthy diet\" src=\"https://alpineinterface.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/nutrition.jpg?w=300&#038;h=219\" width=\"300\" height=\"219\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Delicious and nutritious!</p></div>\n<p>Compromising one\u2019s health is dangerous and we come up with many excuses why we are out of shape. The reality is that we should make personal health our number one priority.</p>\n<p>Good nutrition is essential to staying healthy and fit. Due to our busy lives, we rarely think of eating properly when we are engrossed in work-related activities. But good nutrition is really one of the main elements to staying healthy and strong and for being ready for a multi-day hiking adventure. There is really no point in going into a blow-by-blow account of what healthy eating is, as we all know what to do but rarely do so.</p>\n<p>To conclude, spending thousands of dollars on an adventure holiday and not being able to enjoy it because you could have been much fitter is not the ideal solution. Being well prepared and fit for your hiking tour \u2013 and life in general \u2013 is.</p>\n<p>1: <strong>CARDIO-VASCULAR TRAINING</strong><br />\nGetting out in the fresh air and getting in a moderately difficult run 3 times per week will do wonders for your outlook on life and will increase your endurance for a summer hiking trip.</p>\n<p>It is impossible to replicate 1000 metres of vertical ascent unless you live in the mountains, but running will give you that added boost to your endurance and strengthen your ankles and thigh muscles, helping them to adapt to the rugged trails in the Alps.</p>\n<p>How you run is also important. I try and mix my runs up, meaning that I have a warm up period, followed by a series of sprints, or accelerate up a hill, or even run down a hill. You need to vary your run whenever possible in order to remain interested in the activity but also in order to get your body accustomed to a variety of effort levels. Hiking is not running, but if you can run comfortably, you can certainly go on a hike.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_319\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"http://alpineinterface.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/mp900182524.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-319\" alt=\"Keeping you fit and happy!\" src=\"https://alpineinterface.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/mp900182524.jpg?w=300&#038;h=198\" width=\"300\" height=\"198\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Keeping you fit and happy!</p></div>\n<p>Trekking in the Alps or in any other range with vertical gains of 1000m (3000ft) or more will tax the body. When training, you should try to increase your heart rate and difficulty in order to replicate what it\u2019s like to hike in the mountains.<br />\nIf you only run at a very slow pace and never bump up your heart rate, you will not really build strength over the season. You should also try and run on trails and not only on pavement. Easier said than done if you live in a busy city but running on terrain which forces you to adjust your gait and speed will strengthen muscles we rarely use when walking on flat, paved surfaces.</p>\n<p><strong>2: GETTING READY &#8211; CARRY A BACKPACK: </strong><br />\nAnother good way to get in shape is to carry a light backpack when grocery shopping and walking to the local coffee shop. Keep in mind that most of our trips require only that you carry a small daypack, or oversized daypack of no more than 35 litres.</p>\n<p>Slowly over time, add some weight. You don\u2019t have to carry three climbing ropes and half your garden\u2019s stones, but by carrying more than just your telephone and keys, your joints and muscles will adjust to the increase in weight. Most hikers on their first day complain of shoulder pain and neck pain as their bodies cannot cope with the straps pulling down on shoulder muscles. If you add increments of weight over the entire winter, by summer, your body will be better adjusted to carrying the extra weight.</p>\n<p><strong>3: WEIGHT TRAINING:</strong><br />\nFor many of us, the thought of spending time in a gym is challenging. However, as we get older, we lose muscle mass and weight training has been shown to reduce some of the effects of ageing. By keeping your muscles strong, you are also keeping your skeleton safe, maintaining a strong core, which can help to prevent chronic back pain and other chronic problems, which come from sedentary lives.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpineinterface.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/mp900178555.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-321\" alt=\"MP900178555\" src=\"https://alpineinterface.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/mp900178555.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a></p>\n<p>Injuries during hiking occur primarily when our guests walk downhill, as their large leg muscles cannot cope with the up-hill they have just completed, and now have to brake and slow themselves all the way to the valley floor, sometimes in excess of 1500 metres.</p>\n<p>Going to the gym at least twice per week is most likely not enough for muscle building but enough to maintain strength and prevent injuries.\u00a0 Each workout includes some time to warm up either on the rowing machine or on the stationary bicycle.<br />\nEach work out session includes time for core training, leg and lower back training and some upper body exercises, and some stretching. You can really cover all of this in less than 40-minutes, not really that much time and you really feel better after.<br />\nIf you have never been to a gym, and you can afford a personal trainer for a few sessions, go for it as they will give you a carefully adapted work out regime which you can tweak as you get stronger. The last thing you want to do is actually start working out and then get injured.<br />\nHere are some links that will help you get ready for the summer season:</p>\n<p>A 20 minute killer core-workout<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjFh4J1dnc\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjFh4J1dnc</a></p>\n<p>Simple exercises for everyday, catered to women, but anyone can obviously benefit from those:<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.sheknows.com/health-and-wellness/articles/958067/the-hikers-workout-for-women\">http://www.sheknows.com/health-and-wellness/articles/958067/the-hikers-workout-for-women</a></p>\n<p>Getting ready for a summer of hiking, climbing and mountaineering:<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.bodyresults.com/e2alpinetraining.asp\">http://www.bodyresults.com/e2alpinetraining.asp</a></p>\n<p><a title=\"Hiking in the Dolomites with Alpine Interface\" href=\"http://www.alpineinterface.com/dolo\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-323 alignright\" alt=\"Jay's Photos for Louis 6\" src=\"https://alpineinterface.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/jays-photos-for-louis-6.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=444\"   /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 314, "location": false, "date": "05-01-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["patagonia sustainability", "growth and sustainability", "yvon chouinard sustainability"], "text": "<p>Yvon Chouinard and the conundrum of sustainability <a href=\"http://ow.ly/kPS2R\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://ow.ly/kPS2R</a></p>\n", "post_id": 331, "location": false, "date": "05-08-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["permethrine", "removal of ticks", "regions where ticks live", "Deet to prevent ticks", "how to remove ticks", "preventing tick bites", "where can ticks be found", "lyme disease", "tick inhabitats", "ticks canada", "checking for ticks", "diagnose of lyme", "how to avoid tick bites", "lime resource pages", "how to avoid lyme disease", "lyme symptoms", "ticks usa", "pros and cons of deet and permethrin"], "text": "<p><strong></strong>The topic of tick bites and Lyme disease is a serious one, and several of our close friends have contracted Lyme disease and have suffered terribly from it over the years.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_351\" style=\"width: 210px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://alpineinterface.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/4549028_s.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-351\" alt=\"tick bite prevention during hiking season\" src=\"https://alpineinterface.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/4549028_s.jpg?w=200&#038;h=300\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A tick waiting for a host, \u00a9 Smithore</p></div>\n<p>As a hiking guide, I am exposed to the type of terrain where Lyme disease transmitting ticks exist, if not thrive, and as our <a href=\"http://www.alpineinterface.com\">hiking trips</a> get under way, I thought that it would be appropriate to discuss this matter.<br />\nWe are no experts on Lyme or any other medical condition, most if not all I will post has been gleaned from the internet and sources will be documented, but it is always good to summarize all the information out there in one place.<br />\nFirst we will look at how to prevent tick bites, then we deal with what to do in case you have been bitten, and finally, we will discuss Lyme disease and other diseases transmitted by ticks.</p>\n<p><strong>TICKS</strong></p>\n<p>Ticks are part of the arachnids family, they are external parasites, living mainly off the blood of mammals and birds. They are different varieties of ticks, and they can transmit some serious diseases.<br />\nTicks can be found almost anywhere in the world. However, they need warm, humid places to develop, and obviously the density of potential &#8216;hosts&#8217; must be high enough for them to survive.<br />\nIdeal places for them are woodlands, highly vegetated areas, grasslands, and a solid population of deer inhabiting these areas.</p>\n<p>Tick season is predominantly between April and September, just when everybody else is outdoors as well, of course.</p>\n<p>Ticks have eight legs, just like spiders, and their body is segmented into two parts, one with its head and the mouth parts, and a second part including the digestive tract, legs, and reproductive organs. Initially small, the digestive tract is the one that swells up like a balloon once the tick has started to siphon off your blood.</p>\n<p><strong>HOW TO PREVENT TICK BITES</strong></p>\n<p>First of all, here are the easy answers:</p>\n<p>1: Wear light-coloured long pants, and stick them into your socks. Wear long-sleeved, light-coloured shirts, and tuck them into your pants. Wear a hat! The light colours will help finding ticks on your clothing, as they are predominantly dark.<br />\n2: Stay on trails, walk in the middle of the trails, do not meander through grasslands, and avoid touching branches and brushes with any part of your body, as ticks will let themselves drop onto potential hosts upon contact.<br />\n3: Shower or bathe as soon as possible after being outdoors, if possible within 2 hours, as ticks on your body can\u00a0be found much easier,\u00a0and if they haven&#8217;t latched on yet, they\u00a0simply get washed off.<br />\n4:\u00a0Conduct a full body tick check, especially under arms, in and around the ears, inside\u00a0your belly-button, behind the\u00a0knees, between the legs, around the waist, and especially in the hair. Ticks like moist, warm places!</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_353\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://alpineinterface.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/img_1077.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-353\" alt=\"check animals and kids for ticks\" src=\"https://alpineinterface.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/img_1077.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Check your family and pets for ticks!</p></div>\n<p>5: Check everybody in the family: kids, and especially\u00a0pets who do roam through the brush, upon their arrival at home. Ticks can hitch a ride on a pet, and latch on to a person once they are in your home. Also check\u00a0backpacks or anything else t hat was with you on your outdoor adventures. Some recommend to tumble dry all clothing on high heat for an hour, to kill any leftover ticks that haven&#8217;t been spotted yet.</p>\n<p>Here is a more controversal prevention method: chemical insect repellants:</p>\n<p>1: DEET: Use products with a minimum of 20% DEET, and apply it directly to your skin. Also apply on children except in the face and hands. It is recommended that repellants used on children should not exceed 30% of DEET in the product.<br />\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website has more information, as well as a list of repellants that are registered with EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) and are deemed okay to use.</p>\n<p>2: Permethrin: Permethrin would be sprayed onto your and/or your childrens&#8217; clothing before heading out. It is an insect repellant that kills ticks upon contact.</p>\n<p>The Lyme Net Europe website has a good article about the pros and cons of DEET and Permethrin:<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.lymeneteurope.org/info/deet-versus-permethrin-as-a-tick-repellent\">http://www.lymeneteurope.org/info/deet-versus-permethrin-as-a-tick-repellent</a></p>\n<p><strong>WHAT TO DO WHEN YOU FIND A TICK ATTACHED TO YOUR SKIN<br />\n</strong>Again, Lyme Net Europe has a thorough description on how to remove ticks:<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.lymeneteurope.org/info/tick-removal\">http://www.lymeneteurope.org/info/tick-removal</a></p>\n<p>Remember:<a href=\"http://alpineinterface.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/7716628_s1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-356\" alt=\"tweezers to remove ticks\" src=\"https://alpineinterface.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/7716628_s1.jpg?w=150&#038;h=35\" width=\"150\" height=\"35\" /></a><br />\n1: Use tweezers with thin ends, or fine point tweezers.

As many ticks will not let go super-easily, you will probably feel the pull on your skin, which will\u00a0lift up as well until the tick lets go.<br />\n4: If the head or other pieces of the tick are still in the skin, try to remove them as well. If this doesn&#8217;t work, go to a doctor to get the leftovers removed.<br />\n4: If you want to get the tick tested, put it in a sealed container. If not, also, put it into a sealed bag, container or similar, and throw it in the garbage.<br />\n5: Disinfect the bitten area with 70% Iodine\u00a0or alcohol, AND disinfect your tweezers!<br />\n6: If you don&#8217;t want to remove the tick yourself, or can&#8217;t do it, go to your doctor promptly to have him remove the tick.<br />\n7: Check the bite location regularly for any signs of rashes.<br />\n8: If you do develop symptoms of irritation, fever, rashes, etc, go to your doctor immediately.

Zoonotic means a disease which can be\u00a0 transmitted from animals to humans. This is what the King County Medical Board says about it.</p>\n<p>\u201c<b>Zoonotic diseases (also called zoonoses) are infectious diseases that can be spread from animals to humans. There are many zoonotic diseases, and their threat to human health is growing due to increasing global movement of people and animals and the effects of human populations expanding into previously undeveloped wildlife habitats.\u00a0 Climatic change may also lead to greater zoonotic diseases threats.\u201d</b></p>\n<p>\u201cLyme disease is a bacterial illness caused by a bacterium called a &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5530\">spirochete</a>.&#8221; In the United States, the actual name of the bacterium is <a href=\"http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=31967\"><i>Borrelia burgdorferi</i></a>. In Europe, another bacterium, <i>Borrelia afzelii</i>, also causes Lyme disease. Certain <a href=\"http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=103607\">ticks</a> found on deer harbor the bacterium in their stomachs. Lyme disease is spread by these ticks when they bite the skin, which permits the bacterium to infect the body. Lyme disease is not contagious from an affected person to someone else. Lyme disease can cause abnormalities in the skin, joints, heart, and nervous system.\u201d Medicinenet.com.</p>\n<p><b> </b>Lyme Disease is transmitted by ticks, and requires the tick to latch on and bite the person or animal. Transmission apparently depends on how long the tick stays attached but again, there does not seem to be any conclusive evidence at the moment giving a particular length of time. The most repeated information is that during the first\u00a024 hours, it is unlikely that the tick is transmitting any pathogen.</p>\n<p>Lyme apparently has been around for thousands of years. The \u201cIce Man\u201d or Otzi, found nearly 20 years ago and thought to have lived nearly 5000 years ago was found to be carrying the Lyme disease bacterium. Interesting to say the least!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://contagions.wordpress.com/2012/07/29/metagenomics-lyme-disease-and-the-tyrolean-icemans-tattoos/\">http://contagions.wordpress.com/2012/07/29/metagenomics-lyme-disease-and-the-tyrolean-icemans-tattoos/</a></p>\n<p><strong>MOST AFFECTED REGIONS:<br />\n</strong>Lyme disease most often occurs-in the United States along the Atlantic coast, the Midwest, and parts of Oregon and California. The main affected areas in Canada are parts of southern Manitoba, southern and eastern Ontario, southwestern Quebec, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. British Columbia is also affected,\u00a0mainly Vancouver Island, and the lower mainland and the Fraser Valley.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><b>What are the signs and symptoms of Lyme Disease?</b></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_359\" style=\"width: 160px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://alpineinterface.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/emforweb2.jpg\"><img class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-359\" alt=\"bulls-eye rash, lyme disease\" src=\"https://alpineinterface.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/emforweb2.jpg?w=150&#038;h=150\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lyme bulls-eye rash, courtesy of CDC</p></div>\n<p align=\"LEFT\">For my 3 friends with Lyme disease, there we no clear signs of Lyme disease. They were either diagnosed with Lupus or MS, or some other ailment such as chronic fatigue, but no doctor ever looked into the possibility that it could be Lyme.<br />\nAt times, I would ski with them only to watch them topple over on the flats, unable to figure out why they could not go in a straight line.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\">I must add that the province of Alberta in Canada, where we live, is not considered endemic to the bacteria that causes Lyme, although since last year Alberta Health and Wellness does recognise that Lyme can indeed be transmitted by ticks in Alberta as well:<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.health.alberta.ca/health-info/lyme-disease.html\">http://www.health.alberta.ca/health-info/lyme-disease.html</a></p>\n<p>This situation obviously made it very difficult for my friends, and it\u00a0took them many frustrating sessions to different doctors in Europe and in the US ( not to mention thousands of dollars in lost wages and expenses) before they were diagnosed and treated for Lyme.</p>\n<p><em>&#8220;I contracted Lyme disease sometime during the 21 years that I was guiding for Outward Bound in Colorado.\u00a0\u00a0I had a number of tick bites but never had a bull&#8217;s eye rash.\u00a0\u00a0I do remember getting a horrible flu one summer and in retrospect I&#8217;m sure that was the infection date, about 20 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0Over the past 10 years I have gotten progressively sicker, with fatigue so severe that it ended my career as a professional skier; I went from running a 3:17 marathon to not being able to walk around the block or even twist a jar open.\u00a0\u00a0My symptoms have included joint pain, muscle weakness, brain fog, thyroid and adrenal dysfunction, and most recently memory loss. I&#8217;ve seen about 12 doctors and 3 actually tested me for Lyme, but they used the notoriously unreliable ELISA test and I got false negative results.\u00a0\u00a0I&#8217;ve been misdiagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Fibromyalgia, and tested for Parkinson&#8217;s, MS and Lupus. The worst part of the whole process was being told repeatedly that I was simply depressed, this was &#8220;all in my head&#8221; and I was making mountains out of molehills.\u00a0\u00a0 When I started getting sick I had just won two world championships in extreme skiing, but I was being told this was the normal aging process.</em></p>\n<p><em>\u00a0This Fall I watched my personality start to change, constantly feeling anxious and overwhelmed, then my memory got really bad.\u00a0\u00a0I actually left my skis at the ski area but reported them stolen from my car the next day because I couldn&#8217;t remember going skiing.\u00a0\u00a0I couldn&#8217;t afford to get any sicker or lose any more of my mind, and I knew I had Lyme.\u00a0\u00a0So I found a Doctor in Calgary who was willing to order the &#8216;gold standard&#8217; lab test from IGeneX in California and paid for it out of pocket.\u00a0\u00a0I got my diagnosis and found a Lyme specialist in Seattle, Dr Marty Ross.\u00a0\u00a0I have been on antibiotics for 2 months now and I have some pretty crappy days with vomiting, vertigo and nerve pain but I also know I&#8217;m getting better.\u00a0\u00a0I went for a 15 minute run yesterday and loved it, though I reckon I&#8217;ll wait a while until I let Louis kick my butt on the trails this summer&#8230;\u00a0&#8220;</em>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Maegan Carney</p>\n<p>Here is a pretty good link to what many of the signs and symptoms are. Again, there is a\u00a0myriad of symptoms, and many \u00a0people are treated for the wrong ailment.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://arthritis.webmd.com/tc/lyme-disease-symptoms\">http://arthritis.webmd.com/tc/lyme-disease-symptoms</a></p>\n<p>In France, where I lived for many years, doctors do not hesitate to assume that a tick bite could lead to Lyme and then would prescribe a course of antibiotics. I am\u00a0 not saying that systematic use of antibiotics is good, but the French doctors I have dealt with, always thought that Lyme could be a possibility and therefore, were unwilling to take any chances.</p>\n<p><b><br />\n</b>If you have the time, look at this trailer from the film <em>Under our Skin</em>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxWgS0XLVqw\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxWgS0XLVqw</a></p>\n<p>Links to official websites:</p>\n<p>Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, USA:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/</a></p>\n<p>Public Health Agency of Canada</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/id-mi/lyme-eng.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/id-mi/lyme-eng.php</a></p>\n<p>LymeNet Europe</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.lymeneteurope.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.lymeneteurope.org/</a></p>\n", "post_id": 335, "location": false, "date": "05-14-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["how to choose a guide", "why hire a guide", "importance of guided trips", "a guide for your outdoor adventures"], "text": "<p>An article on @ngadventure on why guides to the outdoor world matter&#8230;.other than taking your holiday photos.<br />\nWe couldn&#8217;t agree more! <a href=\"http://ow.ly/lysvi\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://ow.ly/lysvi</a></p>\n", "post_id": 364, "location": false, "date": "05-30-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["cortina by rail", "corvara tourist office", "how to get to cortina", "corvara dolomites by air", "cortina by air", "cortina tourist office", "how to get to the dolomites", "how to get to corvara"], "text": "<p>We are focusing on two different towns for this post: Cortina d&#8217;Ampezzo, and\u00a0Colfosco, as this is where most of our Dolomites trips\u00a0start.<a href=\"http://alpineinterface.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/cortina2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-419\" alt=\"cortina2\" src=\"https://alpineinterface.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/cortina2.jpg?w=300&#038;h=277\" width=\"300\" height=\"277\" /></a></p>\n<p>BY AIR:</p>\n<p>Corvara and Cortina d&#8217;Ampezzo have plenty of choices when<br />\nit comes to airports, many of which are served with flights from the low-cost airlines from the UK or with travel company charter flights.

If you decide to have the tax back on your credit card, you will have to post the pink slip which will have a stamp placed on it and the address already on it.</p>\n<p><strong>2: ITALY<br />\nRules for Italian VAT refunds:<br />\n</strong>Here is the legal mumbo-jumbo directly from the Italian Government:<strong><br />\n</strong>You can be granted VAT refund or relief provided that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You are a EU non &#8211; resident traveller;</li>\n<li>The goods are intended for personal or familiar use and are personally carried in your baggage;</li>\n<li>The overall value of goods exceeds 154,94 Euro (VAT included);</li>\n<li>The purchase is certified by an invoice containing the description of goods, your personal data as well as the particulars of your passport or of any such\u00a0equivalent document;</li>\n<li>The goods leave the EU territory within three months after the purchase was made;</li>\n<li>The goods go through some special customs formalities;</li>\n<li>The invoice is returned to the Italian seller within four months after the purchase was made.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>CUSTOMS FORMALITIES TO BE CARRIED OUT:<br />\nThe goods purchased and the relevant invoice must be shown at\u00a0 customs when leaving\u00a0 EU territory.</p>\n<p>The Customs office, after having ascertained that all the requirements are met, endorses the invoice. This endorsement is essential to prove that the goods have\u00a0effectively left the Community territory.</p>\n<p>The Customs office where the invoice must be presented in the last country belonging to the EU,\u00a0 before you are returning home.<br />\nIf, for example, you purchase goods in Italy and then you travel to Austria, the Customs office to visit is the Austrian Customs office.</p>\n<p>However, in case you are checking in only once, receiving your boarding pass for your connecting flight right away, and your final destination is outside of the EU, you can go to the Customs office located at your departure airport. (Example: You fly from Milano to Frankfurt, and then to New York. In theory, you would have to process your paper work at Cstoms in Frankfurt, as this is from where you are leaving the EU zone. But as you have already received your boarding pass for your connecting flight from Frankfurt to New York in Milano, and you have checked in your luggage in Milano, which means that Customs in Frankfurt can&#8217;t check that you are really exporting your purchased items, you have to go to Customs in Milano).</p>\n<p>Note that the goods must be shown at the customs office: if you intend to pack the purchased items into your check-in luggage, you must go to Customs BEFORE checking in.</p>\n<p>Customs controls and the certification required to obtain VAT refund may require a long wait, especially at the biggest airports or in concurrence with the departure of\u00a0international flights going to certain third countries; therefore, in order to avoid unpleasant delays, please go to Customs at least two hours before flight departure.</p>\n<p>HOW TO RETURN THE INVOICE TO THE ITALIAN SELLER<br />\nAs for the refund, you will have to send the papers received by Customs to the Italian shop where you pruchased the items, within four months after the papers had been issued.</p>\n<p>If the seller doesn&#8217;t receive your papers within four months, he will have to pay VAT for your purchase to the government.</p>\n<p>This is why\u00a0 Italian salesmen, as a precaution, prefers to charge you VAT, and then refund it later once you have sent back the processed documents. Alternatively, there are some TAX-FREE companies that can grant immediate VAT cash refund when the goods leave the\u00a0Italian or Community territory, i.e. without you having to return the papers to the seller: however you can use this procedure only at the big international airports or main border crossings.</p>\n<p>However, the services supplied by TAX-FREE companies imply the payment of a sum which is directly deducted from the amount of VAT refunded\u00a0to you.</p>\n<p><strong>3: SWITZERLAND</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Swiss VAT refund requirements:</strong><br />\nA Sales tax (VAT) of 7.6% is included in prices. A refund for the VAT can be obtained for receipts of taxable amounts of CHF 300 or more. Visitors should ask shop staff for the refund form, which must be validated by a customs official at the time of departure from Switzerland and mailed by the customer back to the shop. The shop where the items were purchased will obtain the refund on behalf of the purchaser.</p>\n<p>3 easy steps to claiming your refund in Switzerland:</p>\n<p>- In the shop:<br />\nThe total purchases in a shop must amount to CHF 300 (including VAT). Yout must reside outside of Switzerland and the goods must be exported within 30 days.</p>\n<p>- Through customs:<br />\nWhen leaving Switzerland, the Tax-Free Shopping checks have to be stamped by Swiss customs authorities after showing the goods to them.</p>\n<p>- Collecting the refund<br />\nYou have several choices: immediate cash at a Cash Refund Office, direct credit to a chosen credit card or bank account, a bank cheque and even, for certain countries, a cash refund when you return home.</p>\n<p>With the euro zone in dire financial trouble there may be an opportunity this coming summer to make some purchases which will not break the bank. Chamonix still has some of the best deals to be found\u00a0 of any of the Alpine resorts. If you are travelling late in the summer season, you will find many of the shops slashing prices up to %50 on gear. Add a %20 VAT refund and you will come away with some flash gear that you will\u00a0 not be able to find in North America. In Chamonix, look for the Millet shop which sells some very good gear at reasonable prices.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.millet.fr/en/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.millet.fr/en/</a></p>\n<p>Below are the member states of the European Union.</p>\n<div id=\"contenuti_piede_bx\"></div>\n<table summary=\"The following table lists the member states of the European Union\">\n<caption><strong>MEMBER STATE OF THE EU</strong></caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Austria</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Belgium</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Cyprus</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Czech Republic</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Denmark</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>EIRE</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Estonia</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Finland</strong></td>\n<td><strong>France</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Germany</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Greece</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Hungary </strong></td>\n<td><strong>Italy</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Latvia</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Lithuania</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Luxembourg</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Malta</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Poland</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Portugal</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Slovakia</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Slovenia</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Spain</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Sweden</strong></td>\n<td><strong>The Netherlands</strong></td>\n<td><strong>United Kingdom</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>If you have questions, please let us know, we will try and answer any questions you might have.<br />\nHappy Trails, and Happy Shopping,</p>\n<p>Karin and Louis Marino</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>// </p>\n", "post_id": 60, "location": false, "date": "01-20-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["hiking switzerland", "guided hiking tours alps", "hiking france", "mont blanc express", "guided hiking alps", "switzerland tour", "hiking italy", "hiking alps", "hiking swiss alps", "tour du mont blanc", "hiking french alps", "chamonix zermatt", "guided haute route", "guided hiking tours", "travel"], "text": "<p>Hello all hiking enthusiasts!!</p>\n<p>The summer is now just around the corner (well, maybe not quite, but we&#8217;re getting there).<br />\nIt&#8217;s time for a summary of all of our confirmed hiking trips we will be running in the Alps, if any of you are interested in any trip and departure, send us a quick email, here it is:</p>\n<table width=\"130\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" align=\"right\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th scope=\"col\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-68\" title=\"Above Zermatt, the majestic Matterhorn\" alt=\"Matterhorn above Zermatt, Switzerland\" src=\"https://alpineinterface.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/matterhorn-e1334847369424.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></th>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>SWITZERLAND<br />\n<strong>Walker&#8217;s Haute Route, Huts &amp;

If you pick up a pack and it already feels heavy (without having put anything inside) you should probably look at another model. On most of our hiking journeys, you will not need to carry a sleeping bag or tent. Light, small packs with a rain cover if possible, are the best, and a 30 to 35-litre pack would be ideal.</p>\n<p>- Torso length: Find a backpack that fits snugly on your back, and let&#8217;s you adjust\u00a0 the straps. Make sure that your hip belt sits nicely ON your hips. This is especially important for larger backpacks whcih will carry heavier weights.<br /> <strong>80% or more of your backpack&#8217;s weight should be carried on your hips, and NOT on your shoulders.</strong><br /> If your shoulders and neck hurt after a day of hiking, your backpack is either not adjusted correctly, or is carried the wrong way.</p>\n<p>- What goes where?<br /> There is a beautiful graphic and an explanation on Deuter&#8217;s website to help you pack your rucksack. Ideally, the backpack&#8217;s centre of gravity should be as close to your body as possible, at about shoulder height. Have a look here:<br /> <a title=\"Deuter - How to carry a backpack\" href=\"http://www.deuterusa.com/img/systems/carrying.gif\" target=\"_blank\">How to carry a backpack</a></p>\n<p>- Sweaty days&#8230;<br /> Deuter makes backpacks with a light mesh that keeps the backpack away from your back, so it doesn&#8217;t touch, and therefore doesn&#8217;t make you sweat where the pack touches your back. This makes your hike so much more comfortable.</p>\n<p>Our favourite backpacks are made by Deuter and Osprey.<br /> Deuter packs are very comfortable, no-nonsense affairs. They have been in the business of making backpacks for over a 100 years, and still come up with new features that really enhance the performance, instead of unnecessary bells and whistles.<br /> <a title=\"Deuter packpacks\" href=\"http://www.deuter.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.deuter.com</a></p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_90\" style=\"width: 210px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://alpineinterface.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/screws_map.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-90\" alt=\"2.5 hours of surgery later...\" src=\"https://alpineinterface.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/screws_map.jpg?w=200&#038;h=150\" width=\"200\" height=\"150\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">2.5 hours of surgery later&#8230;</p></div>\n<p>In 2003, after a miserable expedition to Everest North side, I finally had my shoulder looked at. Surgery was required and 5 screws and about 70 physiotherapy sessions later, my shoulder functions quite well.</p>\n<p>However, each year I guide roughly 4 months during the summer season without much time off and my pack becomes a pretty heavy burden. Deuter has been my preferred brand of pack so far, but I have now added a second brand to my favourite packs.</p>\n<p>After trying on a guest&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.ospreypacks.com/en/group/superlight/exos_series\">Osprey Exos 46</a>, I had a bit of a gear epiphany and went pain-free the remainder of the summer wearing that pack. I did buy my own though!</p>\n<p>I have added a link to Osprey&#8217;s website. I strongly recommend looking into this particular pack. I would still recommend Deuter gear, but Osprey has really come up with a light-weight, easy to use thru-pack for classic treks such as our <a title=\"Hiking the Classic Haute Route\" href=\"http://alpineinterface.com/haute\">Haute Route</a> and <a title=\"Guided trekking trips in Patagonia\" href=\"http://www.alpineinterface.com/patagonia/\">Patagonia Adventures</a>.

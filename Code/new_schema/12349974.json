Unfortunately, these journals won\u2019t take poems published anywhere else, even on the internet, even just on a blog. And apparently if you take down your poems, the search engines keep archives, so your poems can still show up. So I won\u2019t be posting any more poems online as I write new poems and try to get them published. I\u2019ll be using an interesting online company called Writers Relief that will do submissions for me, targeting magazines most likely to accept my style of poetry, so we\u2019ll see. But first I have to write a dozen or so new poems. </p>\n<p>I\u2019m excited about what will be a new venture for me, but sad because I have so enjoyed getting to know you wonderful poets and writers on WordPress, especially through exchanging comments on our writing. I\u2019ll still be around and will check out your blogs, especially my favorites (you know who you are), time permitting.

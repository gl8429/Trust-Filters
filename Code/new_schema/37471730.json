My wife will tell you that I have become a hoarder of airplane models, but I will tell you that I am a collector.  I have no problem buying two, three, or six of the same kit.  With so many different versions and paint schemes, you have to.  This is the kit that started my obsession with building again.  It is an Accurate Miniatures 1/72 Predator.  I picked this kit up at my local Hobby Lobby on clearance.  I think I paid around $7.00 for it.  Great price.   My dad and I took a trip to the Air Force Museum in Dayton, Ohio, and they have a Predator on display.  I shot some pictures and this was my template.  I used Model Masters gloss white for the fuselage and used generic markings for the decals.  After I completed it, I discovered that they make an update of this model with Hellfire missles.  I guess that I will have to re-buy this one.  Overall, this was a good welcome back to the hobby.  The kit went together quite well and I don&#8217;t remember too many difficulties (I &#8220;misplaced&#8221; a piece or two).  Since I completed this kit, I have built about fifty more kits.  I have found that every kit you build, you get a little bit smarter for the next build.  Currently I am building two kits.  The first one is Italeri&#8217;s 1/72 B-52G.  The second, I just started this morning is Revell&#8217;s 1/72 Su-27 Flanker.  I don&#8217;t build too many foreign planes and thus the reason for this blog.  I told my wife that I should start this to help people like me trying to find the right colors, details, and anything important to make our models look as authentic as we can.  This is my first blog, so here we go&#8230;..</p>\n", "post_id": 1, "location": false, "date": "07-04-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>Successfully, I have kept my pace from the weekend and continued my progress tonight. I was able to get the final color on the Avenger. Also, I airbrushed the Zero&#8217;s yellow waist band and applied the decals. Both Builds should be done in the next couple of days.<br />\nWhile those kits sat idle for dry time, I went ahead and started a new build. I actually could have come close to finishing it tonight. My next two builds are both drones. I began Skunk Models MQ-9 Reaper tonight to get a head start. I never expected to get as far as I did. This is my first attempt with Skunk Models. So far so good. The kit looks well detailed but the plastic is a bit on the soft side. It&#8217;s a minor issue that I can get over. The Reaper should be complete within a few days.<br />\nThe other drone I&#8217;ll be building is Platz&#8217;s X-47B. Upon review, it looks like a simple build. I think (hope) this one will be the same as the Reaper.  </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/20140414-230033.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/20140414-230033.jpg\" alt=\"20140414-230033.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/20140414-230050.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/20140414-230050.jpg\" alt=\"20140414-230050.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 1003, "location": false, "date": "04-15-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>My workbench has been a frenzy with activity lately.

Simple, yet still able to keep my attention, these Zeros were a fun twist to my normal builds. Assembly went well with no hiccups. All around, they were both smooth builds.<br />\nPainting bare metal is not my favorite to do, but I am pleased with the results. I used Model Masters Chrome Silver for the overall color. I also picked a few random panels to contrast the shiny chrome. I used Testors Silver for that effect. I used the pencil weathering method on this one to make all the panel lines stand out more without making the plane look dirty. My spare decals came in handy on this build. Luckily there wern&#8217;t too many decals needed.<br />\nThe Japanese Zero was painted with Model Masters Japanese Army Light Gray. I used my normal pastel weathering for this one to show its use in the war. The decals were a bit tough to work with. Tearing was the main issue. I was glad to have two sets of decals so I could afford a few mistakes. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/20140418-093318.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/20140418-093318.jpg\" alt=\"20140418-093318.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/20140418-093338.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/20140418-093338.jpg\" alt=\"20140418-093338.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/20140418-093346.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/20140418-093346.jpg\" alt=\"20140418-093346.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/20140418-093351.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/20140418-093351.jpg\" alt=\"20140418-093351.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 1010, "location": false, "date": "04-18-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>Motivated by the progress of the Zero builds, I finished my TBM-3 Avenger.

I  was apprehensive at first about the parts being too soft of a plastic but they turned out to be great to work with. The only filler used was on one seam of one bomb.

I&#8217;m interested to see how the two compare with each other.<br />\nThe final choice wasn&#8217;t as dramatic as the other two. It has been on the &#8220;to build&#8221; list for a while, but it doesn&#8217;t have the backstory that the F-16&#8217;s have. I am going to build Fujimi&#8217;s 1/72 A-4E Skyhawk. I have been a fan of the Skyhawk since I was a kid and I am excited to get this one built. Like the other two kits, I am in the opening stages of construction. Everything looks great so far. I am always impressed with Fujimi and i don&#8217;t think this one will disappoint.  </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/20140512-090936.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/20140512-090936.jpg\" alt=\"20140512-090936.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/20140512-090940.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/20140512-090940.jpg\" alt=\"20140512-090940.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/20140512-090947.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/20140512-090947.jpg\" alt=\"20140512-090947.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 1067, "location": false, "date": "05-12-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>I&#8217;m experiencing another lull in the modeling universe.

I&#8217;m not too sure if it was the nose section that was the issue, but that&#8217;s where most of the issues reside. The ill fit of the nose section caused a bad fit of the avionics hump. It was quite the domino effect. Luckily, I have Tamiya filler. It isn&#8217;t a miracle filler, but things look better after I used it.

I sprayed the second coat of white this morning and I will get the gray airbrushed tomorrow.<br />\nThe Hasegawa F-16 is ready for its first coat of paint. This kit needed a lot of sanding at first. The top half of the fuselage seemed to be a bit wider in the nose section than the bottom half. A few rounds of sanding and filling were needed to correct the issue. The electronics spine had a nice fit with the vertical stabilizer. The wings were a nice highlight as they fit very well. I hope to get the final paint job started tomorrow.<br />\nThe outcast Skyhawk turned a corner and came out delightfully decent. It needed some extensive filling and sanding which I spent a lot of time doing. It&#8217;s still not perfect, but I think the defects are minor and unnoticeable. At least I hope they are. I sprayed the second coat of white on the under surfaces this morning. I&#8217;ll try to mask it off tonight or in the morning to move it along to final paint.

The F-16I is used by the IDF (Israeli Defense Force) and I was happy to get my hands on an IDF weapons set from Skunk Models. It was a steep price to pay ($24.99 from Sprue Brothers), but it adds much needed accuracy. The stock weapons would have fallen short.<br />\nThe overall build was good with a few disappointments along the way. I expected more from a detail standpoint as well as good fitting pieces. Most of the parts fit well, but some of the most important parts did not. It wasn&#8217;t major surgery like the Skyhawk, but there were some unwanted challenges.

I guess that is the most important thing. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/20140612-181253-65573627.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/20140612-181253-65573627.jpg\" alt=\"20140612-181253-65573627.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/20140612-181308-65588439.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/20140612-181308-65588439.jpg\" alt=\"20140612-181308-65588439.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/20140612-181322-65602602.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/20140612-181322-65602602.jpg\" alt=\"20140612-181322-65602602.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/20140612-181404-65644582.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/20140612-181404-65644582.jpg\" alt=\"20140612-181404-65644582.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 1120, "location": false, "date": "06-12-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>I thought it would be neat to photograph all three of my F-16 builds together.

I had a great one. I spent the day with my wife and kids relaxing and, of course, doing a little building. I received the best Father&#8217;s Day gift ever. If you ask my wife, I am the most difficult man to buy a gift for. I would agree with her. I&#8217;m just a specific guy. In a bittersweet turn of events, the better of the two hobby shops that I frequent went out of business. That resulted in my gift. I was lucky enough to get my hands on two of their paint racks. Both racks were only $75.00 together. They will make for handy storage of my paints when I get my hobby room at the new house. As far as I am concerned, my wife and kids hit a home run this year. Thank you a million times Elsa, Abby, and Jack!<br />\nThe building aspect of my hobby has been chugging along. I broke open the Mirage and Scorpion. They both look great upon inspection. All the prep work is completed on all three kits. My next step is to build and detail the cockpits. All three look like this set will go well. I&#8217;m leaving for Ludington, MI on Saturday so I suspect this trio will be part of my luggage. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/20140618-113823-41903189.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/20140618-113823-41903189.jpg\" alt=\"20140618-113823-41903189.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/20140618-113825-41905512.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/20140618-113825-41905512.jpg\" alt=\"20140618-113825-41905512.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 1138, "location": false, "date": "06-18-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>Our annual vacation to Ludington, MI has come around with much needed relaxation.

The Mirage turned out to be a fantastic build. I thought I was going to be in for a tough one in the beginning stages, but all leveled out.

When I put the nose weights in, I think I may have put too thick of a layer in the nose causing the fuselage to have a gap in the nose. Another lesson learned. At least I remembered them. I would rather deal with a gap than have a finished model sit on its tail.<br />\nAside from the self-induced gaps, construction went great. Hasegawa did a wonderful job. I would say it is on the lower end of their spectrum but still a fine kit. Good fitting parts led to almost zero filler. I would have liked to see more of a vast ordinance selection but I guess that&#8217;s why Hasegawa makes their own weapon&#8217;s sets separately.<br />\nPainting was a multi-step process with the Tiger Meet scheme. I unfortunately used some bad paint which caused some inconsistency in the top color. Thankfully, I got away without having to repaint the whole plane. The decals were good on this build.

From the looks of the dry-fitting, they&#8217;ll stay pretty close throughout their respective builds.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/20140708-142307-51787172.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/20140708-142307-51787172.jpg\" alt=\"20140708-142307-51787172.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/20140708-142333-51813260.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/20140708-142333-51813260.jpg\" alt=\"20140708-142333-51813260.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/20140708-142418-51858411.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/20140708-142418-51858411.jpg\" alt=\"20140708-142418-51858411.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/20140708-142544-51944509.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/20140708-142544-51944509.jpg\" alt=\"20140708-142544-51944509.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/20140708-142558-51958331.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/20140708-142558-51958331.jpg\" alt=\"20140708-142558-51958331.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 1180, "location": false, "date": "07-08-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>I knew it was too good to be true to have three perfect builds.

With the big move drawing closer, I am grateful these three builds are going well.<br />\n\tThe Airacobra came out of priming with zero hint that there were ever any seams or gaps. The wings were attached last night. The fuselage didn&#8217;t want to fit, resulting in a little sanding at the wing roots. I&#8217;m pretty confident that it won&#8217;t require any filler, but I will prime the wing roots tonight just to be sure. I was also able to work on the canopy and the canopy door. I masked both off and painted them with interior green. The door needs a little detailing, but for the most part they are ready for final paint. There will be a few steps to painting this one. I will start with the white on the tail and leading edges. After I mask those off, all should be a normal paint job with the belly being gray and the top olive drab. I am hoping for a mid week finish.<br />\n\tThe Corsair has been re-masked and is ready for final paint. The canopy and wind screen were masked off and painted with interior green last night. My garage is in disarray right now so I am unsure when I can get to my airbrush to get it painted. Maybe I can clear a path tonight and get it finished. We&#8217;ll see.<br />\n\tThe Banshee is limping along. I filled the gaps in the wing roots and I will sand them tonight. I don&#8217;t think it will require too much more attention to remedy. Maybe a little more filler will do the trick. I put two layers on last night to build up the fuselage. Luckily, it&#8217;s the underside of the airplane so I don&#8217;t have to be quite as picky with the results. After I get this issue addressed, it will be ready for paint. Other than the wing fitting, this has been a great build. All three kits have performed well for what I am thinking will be my last builds in my current home. Who knows, I might be able to squeak one or two more out before then.

I am enjoying working on this one. Anyway, the A-10 is ready for the cockpit to be assembled and detailed. This will be a closed cockpit build so I won&#8217;t get carried away. The wings and engine nacelles are finished and ready to be affixed. Once the cockpit is installed the rest should be pretty easy. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/20140807-054703-20823830.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/20140807-054703-20823830.jpg\" alt=\"20140807-054703-20823830.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/20140807-054719-20839426.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/20140807-054719-20839426.jpg\" alt=\"20140807-054719-20839426.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/20140807-054732-20852991.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/20140807-054732-20852991.jpg\" alt=\"20140807-054732-20852991.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 1284, "location": false, "date": "08-07-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>The workbench has been running in high gear the last twenty-four hours.

The sanding was finalized last night and I dry fit the wind screen to be sure of a good fit. To my surprise, it fit great. I did notice a small gap that I missed during the filling process. I filled it up and I will give it a light sanding today. With all remaining construction completed, I will begin the painting process soon.<br />\nThe Intruder has gone from pieces to a plane. I am thrilled with the progress that has been made. I buckled down last night and put the fuselage halves together along with all the remaining fuselage parts. There will be lots of time sanding this one. The seams have a ridge on them that need to be sanded smooth. I&#8217;m ok with that. This build is progressing and that is all that matters to me.<br />\nThe A-10 is a bit farther. The fuselage halves are together and look pretty bad. No matter how much fiddling that I did, the halves would not match up throughout the entire fuselage. I bit the bullet and let it be. As you can see, the whole plane needed to be filled. There weren&#8217;t any gaps, just one side being higher than the other. I will sand and prime it today.

The wings are on and filler was added at the wing roots. The filling and sanding has become the norm on this kit. I touched up some spots on the nose and spine today.

The Tigers paint job was straight forward with flat gull gray. The YA-10 took a little longer to paint with the pre-shading. I airbrushed a thin layer over the entire airplane to start with. Next, I filled in the panels and built up the layers of paint on the panel lines so just enough of the black would show through.

I have to leave for work in a few hours and I would hate to get into a project that I can&#8217;t finish.<br />\nThe Intruder is ready for its final color. The canopy was the holdup until this morning. For some reason, Intruder and Prowler kits have two piece canopies. I wouldn&#8217;t care if it were not a clear part. The two pieces have to be joined together causing a seam. I am not a huge fan of sanding clear parts, but that is what had to be done. First, I glued the halves together. After they dried, I glued a piece of flat sprue on the underside of the canopy to add some strength. I then sanded the seam and filled some low spots. I finished sanding last night and sprayed it with flat black this morning.

The YA-10 also had zero issues. My home made decals worked great. The only downside is that you have to cut them out precisely. They are all one big decal until you cut them out.

This post will inform you on how I make my decals when a need arises. In my opinion, I would take stock decals over homemade. Unless you have a high quality printer (I do not), the results won&#8217;t be the best. However, even a basic printer will get you by.<br />\nSo to start off, what decals are you wanting to make/design. For the YA-10, I scanned the entire stock decal sheet to my computer. I made it into a PDF file and printed straight from that. There was no sizing to do whatsoever. If you have a design program, your options increase on your capabilities. You can make  your chosen design and scale it down to size. I use the basic Paint program that came with my computer. If I make my own designs, it&#8217;s usually limited to some nose art or a bureau number. I haven&#8217;t delved too far into this process. You can also find an image or logo online that you want to use and save it as an image to your computer. Open it up in your design program and size it down.<br />\nWhen it comes to sizing, I make multiple images that are different sizes. Print that out on a plain white sheet of paper and decide which size fits best. Hold it up to your kit and compare the various size options. Once you have chosen the right size, it&#8217;s time to print on decal paper.<br />\nWhen it comes time to print, there are two decal paper options. Clear paper is just like a stock sheet of decals. When you cut them out, the film is clear. White decal paper is as you would guess&#8230;.white. Most computers do not print the color white so this would be the option to go with if you have that need. The downside to this selection is that you have to be 100% accurate when cutting your decals out. Any overhang of a missed cut and you will have a white border. So trim well when using this option. I have always gone with clear. Testors makes both options and quite honestly, that is all I have ever seen being sold. I am sure there are other makers out there that work just the same if not better. The Testors paper is smaller than a standard size sheet of paper so you will need to adjust your printer to accept the smaller sheets. Once you have that corrected, go ahead and print your decals out.<br />\nThis is by far the easiest part of the process. Click print. Or print preview if you want to check out how they will lay out. After I print them out, I let them sit for a day to completely dry. After they are completely dry, I spray them with Testors decal bonder. It is available in a rattle can and also comes in a decal maker kit. Don&#8217;t waste your money on the kit unless it&#8217;s your only option. The provided cd is useless. I have also heard of clear gloss being used to seal them in but I have not tried it. Use it at your own risk. Once you give it a good spray with the bonder, let them sit another day to dry. After that, you are ready to start using your creation.<br />\nThat is the gist of what I do for my decals. I am quite positive that there is a better way to do it and I am open to your suggestions. I hope this will help you out or give you the courage to try it. Any questions?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/p1020684.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/p1020684.jpg\" alt=\"P1020684.JPG\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 1330, "location": false, "date": "08-23-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>I couldn&#8217;t build an Intruder without referencing the great 80&#8217;s film &#8220;Flight of the Intruder&#8221;.

There are great cockpit shots that give you a look at all the bits and pieces inside.<br />\nWell, I finally painted the A-6 yesterday afternoon.

I am new to this company so we will see how they go. They sure look good on the sheet.<br />\nEverything else to this build is finished up except for the canopy.

Instead of risking any damage to the fuselage, I sawed the canopy in half to make it in the open position.

To solve the dilemma, I figured why not build both? So the MiG-15 is my fourth build. I know that I am anti-Airfix but I have built this kit before and I don&#8217;t recall it being bad. The cockpit parts are painted and are just waiting to be assembled. My hope is to get that done this evening. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/p1020677.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/p1020677.jpg\" alt=\"P1020677.JPG\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/p1020678.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/p1020678.jpg\" alt=\"P1020678.JPG\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 1337, "location": false, "date": "08-26-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Barry T.

I can foresee starting more kits before this one gets completed.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/p1020724.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/p1020724.jpg\" alt=\"P1020724.JPG\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/p1020725.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/p1020725.jpg\" alt=\"P1020725.JPG\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/p1020728.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/p1020728.jpg\" alt=\"P1020728.JPG\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 1397, "location": false, "date": "09-09-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["1/72 hasegawa", "airplane model", "s2f tracker", "valiant air command warbird museum", "florida museum", "airplanes", "titusville", "super scale international", "model"], "text": "<p>How do we choose our hobbies? How does a hobby like building models start? I can&#8217;t remember how old I was when I began to enjoy putting together model airplanes, but I do remember an F-14 that my dad built for me. That poor kit didn&#8217;t have a chance with me. Things do have a way of coming full circle. I now have a son and I have built a model for him.<br />\nMy family and I recently took a trip to Disney World. During a little free time, my son and I took a trip to the Valiant Air Command Warbird Museum in Titusville. While it is on the smaller side of museums, it is well worth visiting. Another nice aspect is that the planes are not segregated from you. You are able to reach out and touch history. To my son, this was very important. He was able to grab onto missiles and wheels, all the cool stuff a two year old boy could handle. At one point, I tried to sit him in the intake of an A-7 for a neat photo op. He wasn&#8217;t having any part of that. We entered the Vietnam hangar and browsed the ten or so aircraft in the hangar. Then along came the S2F Tracker. Not a spectacular airplane, but the access door was open. I quickly picked him up and let him fly. Never had I given any thought of building a Tracker until that day. I immediately went on eBay and purchased Hasegawa&#8217;s 1/72 Japanese version. I added a set of Super Scale International decals to make it as accurate as possible. Aside from the wings fighting me, there were no major issues. It&#8217;s thrilling to build, but it&#8217;s better to build the one&#8217;s you&#8217;ve seen up close.<br />\nAirplanes have always fascinated me, thanks to my Dad. I can already see the amazement in my son.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/20120712-225343.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full\" alt=\"20120712-225343.jpg\" src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/20120712-225343.jpg\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/20120712-225428.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full\" alt=\"20120712-225428.jpg\" src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/20120712-225428.jpg\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 140, "location": false, "date": "07-13-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>Last night was productive on all three builds.

Among the accomplishments from today are the cockpit, landing gear, landing gear doors, air intakes, arresting hook assembly, and exhaust cans. It was quite a checklist. I worked on one area at a time and kept pushing forward. I have to make some ejection handles because I stole the ones from this kit to use on my Intruder build. The rest of the kit will still be complicated, but I have set myself up perfectly to proceed.<br />\nThe Bf-110 remains a great kit as well. The wings and vertical stabilizers were attached last night and primed this morning. There are a few small gaps to be filled. Certainly nothing huge to worry about. My goal is to start painting this one tomorrow night.<br />\nThe P-47 hit a little snag when I adhered the fuselage halves. There was a good size gap right behind the cockpit. I filled it last night and added some more this morning. I will sand and prime it tonight and hopefully move on to the wing attachment.

That challenge is to double my productivity from 2013. The goal is fifty builds in 2014. I am very pleased to continually be on pace. With the conclusion of the F-14, my total built this year is thirty-nine. As of now, I am building at a pace of about 4.33 kits per month. At the birth of the challenge, I was producing exactly four builds per month. The 1/3 increase in production is quite encouraging. If I can keep pace, I will end the year with fifty-two builds. The current trio of builds are moving along quite well and if I can finish them in the next week, I think I can increase my average. Maybe I will go for fifty-five or sixty? In the mean time, all the focus is on moving forward rotating from kit to kit. Ninety-three days to finish eleven more builds.<br />\nSo with my goal in mind, I am chipping away at each of my three current builds. The PV-1 has pulled away and is leading in production. The seams have been sanded, filled and primed. The wings were attached late last night and depending on how the seams appear, I will move on to the tail section this evening.<br />\nThe Buffalo also saw it&#8217;s seams get sanded last night. I sprayed a coat of primer on and I will address any missed spots tonight. My ultimate goal for tonight is to get the wings attached. There won&#8217;t be too much left to go after that.<br />\nThe MiG is being slightly neglected with the production from the other two. I wasn&#8217;t able to get the seams tackled yesterday so that is my agenda tonight. If I&#8217;m lucky, I will even get it primed.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/p1020794.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/p1020794.jpg\" alt=\"P1020794.JPG\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/p1020791.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/p1020791.jpg\" alt=\"P1020791.JPG\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 1456, "location": false, "date": "09-29-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["1/72 hasegawa", "scalehobbyist.com", "1/72 airfix", "1/72 academy", "kingfisher", "airplane model", "ea-18 growler", "Spruebrothers.com", "airplane", "helldiver", "f-15e"], "text": "<p>Extra money is a great commodity.

Although $60.00 isn&#8217;t a lot to work with, I can definitely make some magic. Since the day of the hobby shop is gone, I went online. First, I needed a starting point. Of all the kits on my want list, which one could I finally check off? My first choice was Hasegawa&#8217;s 1/72 EA-18 Growler. The search began on eBay. As everybody knows, eBay is hit or miss. You either get a good deal or you don&#8217;t. Not too much in between. With the outrageous shipping costs on eBay, I went to SprueBrothers.com. They have a good selection with reasonable prices. I was able to find the Growler for $27.99. The only problem was that I couldn&#8217;t find another $30.00 worth to go with it. My next step was Scalehobbyist.com. This is by far my favorite place to shop. They had my Growler for $26.79. Not a huge difference, but their model selection is fantastic. I was able to add an Airfix 1/72 Kingfisher, Airfix 1/72 Helldiver, and an Academy 1/72 F-15E Eagle. My total with shipping was only $63.99. With such a vast selection and good prices, ScaleHobbyist makes it tough to keep your order within budget.

I worked on the trio and made little strides that offered vast progress. The MiG was the biggest success. The seams sanded well and it did not stop there. After I sanded them, I figured why not put the wings on? So I went ahead and attached them. There was a little shaping required for a good fit. After they were done, I figured why not build up the air intakes? So I went ahead and built and attached them. To make a long story short, all the little projects added up to the MiG being very close to being ready for paint. It is primed and looks pretty good. There are a few areas that can improve, but for the most part I have the green light to wrap up construction and move to painting this beast.<br />\nThe Buffalo saw minor production with its wings getting affixed. There were slight gaps at the wing roots that I filled last night. I will get those sanded today and be ready for paint soon. I guess it is time to make a decision on what scheme to do.<br />\nThe Ventura continues to move along. The tail section was addressed last night and the wind screen was installed.

My normal schedule is four twelves and then I am off for four days. It&#8217;s an unbeatable schedule. With the open spot, I have to work six twelves with two days off in between. To make matters worse, I caught a cold for my last two days off and now I am back at work to start a long week of ninety-six hours in six days.

For the countless hours of filling and sanding to the scratch building of the bombay, it was a healthy task to accept.<br />\nBack in February, on our trip to Florida, my father-in-law and I took a flight on a Stearman. When we got back, I grabbed one in my inventory and built it for him. Long story short, his boss&#8217;s husband liked the models that I had built for my father- in-law(B-17G, Ford Tri Motor, USS Oriskany, and now the Stearman). Wonderfully enough, he was in the Air Force and flew in a B-52G. I offered to build a model for him and needless to say I was a little overwhelmed. The biggest kit I had built was a C-130. A challenge is a great thing for a modeler. It makes us work harder to succeed. It makes us look closer at the details.<br />\nTo make things easier, I started on all of the ground equipment and figures first. It took me about eighty hours to complete them all. Next, I chose to piece the B-52 together. I built the engines and then moved to the landing gear. I built a total of eighteen 500lb. bombs and twelve JDAM&#8217;s.  I tried to keep it as simple as I could.<br />\nThe time came to start on the plane itself. Before I could do anything, I had to cut out the bombay doors. Almost immediately after I cut them out, I realized that they were double hinged. I had to cut one in half and put it back on the plane. More customization later. The fuselage was a bad fit entirely. I had to saw the halves apart near the wing to force it flush. Even then it wasn&#8217;t 100%. Out came my Craftsman hand sander. I used 400 grit sandpaper to get the problem areas down and then switched to 600 grit. I know it sounds like a gruesome method, but it worked. After the torture, I filled all the gaps with Testors putty. A few more rounds of this and I was ready for final sanding. I used 1000 grit for this.<br />\nNext came the assembly of the huge wings. Right from the start there were issues to address. In certain areas, plastic was missing. Luckily most of it was on the bottom of the wings. After corrections, normal filling and sanding did the trick. After attaching the wings to the fuselage, all that was left was the final prep work. I had to cut new panel lines on the top of the fuselage from the heavy sanding.<br />\nPainting this monster was the easiest part. My paint of choice for this kit was all Model Masters paints. I started by painting the entire plane in SAC Bomber Green(FS34159). When that cured, I used Dark Green(FS34079) to start the camouflage. Next came SAC Bomber Tan to finish off the camouflage scheme. I shot the nose with Euro I Gray(FS36081) to complete the paint job.<br />\nFinal assembly is one of my favorite steps in the building process. The fruits of your labor are finally showing. For the most part, assembly went smooth. I ended up using spare parts from an F-22 Raptor and an Oriskany kit to scratch build the bombay. The landing gear gave me a few headaches fitting, but I was able to make do. For the decals, I ended up using the ones provided with the kit. Coincidentally it turns out that he actually flew on this tail number. For the base, I used masonite spray painted gray. I used a sharpie to grid the concrete and added oil spots for more realism. Arrange, super glue, and finished. This was definitely my most challenging build. I put many hours into this kit and looking back, I enjoyed every bit of it. Then I had to give it away. It ended up being a birthday present and I couldn&#8217;t have asked for a better recipient. Although it was hard to let go, I know that it will be appreciated. Ultimately, the challenge of the build exceeds the end result for me.

The MiG has been covered in Future Floor Polish and is ready for decals. The use of Future has been a popular topic as of late and I decided to experiment with it. Normally, I would use my airbrush to apply it. The question was asked if you HAD to use an airbrush. The decision was to apply the Future using a paintbrush. I tested an area on the underside first using a one inch brush. After it dried and all looked well, I proceeded to go over the entire plane carefully. Treat it as you would paint. It will run and collect in certain areas like paint does. You will notice brush strokes as you go but do not worry as they level out to a smooth shiny surface. Now I will say this about this method. It is still being applied with a brush and it doesn&#8217;t compare to using an airbrush. It will work on the MiG because it will get a matte finish after the decals have been applied. In a pinch it will do.<br />\nWith the MiG close to being complete, my focus is now on getting some paint on the Ventura and Buffalo. The Ventura is masked and ready to go. I just need to steal some time at the airbrush to get both planes painted. I&#8217;ll get to it at the first opportunity.

It&#8217;s a smaller aircraft compared to it&#8217;s brethren, but I am thrilled with the outcome. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/img_0988.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/img_0988.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_0988.JPG\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/img_0989.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/img_0989.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_0989.JPG\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/img_0990.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/img_0990.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_0990.JPG\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/img_0991.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/img_0991.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_0991.JPG\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 1511, "location": false, "date": "10-13-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>Last weekend was one of the most productive weekends that I have had in a while.

I played with the thought of a British version but decided not to forego it. Maybe next time. For the decals, I went with a set from Starfighter Decals.

This is a great looking kit. Like the other two, the parts are clipped from the sprues and awaiting some paint. I&#8217;m undecided on a final paint scheme on this one.

Yesterday was spent kind of related to my hobby. My kids were on fall break so we headed north to the Air Zoo in Kalamazoo, MI. It&#8217;s the perfect selfish destination for aviation enthusiasts. Not only do they have planes and plane related items to peruse, they have carnival rides for the kids! The perfect disguise for a day getaway. I needed reference photographs of the XP-55 Ascender and Kalamazoo has the only surviving example. Great deal all around. We had a wonderful time. After virtually being absent from my wife and kids lives for the past month, it was fantastic to reconnect. And see some planes at the same time.<br />\nThe road to completion has slowly taken form for all three builds. At my last post, they were ready for paint. I am thrilled to report that all three are painted and two of them are ready for weathering.<br />\nThe Hurricane and the Me-262 are ready to be weathered tonight. I put a coat of flat clear on this morning and I will let that dry throughout the day. As for the Fw-190, I airbrushed the last color on this morning. This one took a little longer due to a more complex paint scheme. By complex, I mean more colors. The tail rudder and the bottom of the engine cowl are RLM Yellow so that had to be airbrushed before anything else. The rest was a mix of mottling and masking three different colors. I will do a little touching up after I remove the masks but for the most part the painting is complete.

I cut out the panels with my Craftsman dremel tool.  I wanted to get all the cutting done first in case I ruined the kit.  I cut just below the panel lines and then sanded the rest to give it a good fit. Aside from the update set, I used cardboard and foil for the intake covers.  I also used Femo dough for the end caps on the sidewinders. All the normal building followed from there.  The engines gave me a few problems during sanding, but that about did it for frustration.

If you haven&#8217;t voted, get your picks in soon.<br />\nSo now it&#8217;s time to report my progress. I really haven&#8217;t done a whole lot. I took two days away from my workbench to get away with my wife to Holland, MI. It was a much needed mini vacation. I even found a rare hobby shop in the area. I picked up Revell&#8217;s 1/72 Dornier Do 17 Z-2. There wasn&#8217;t too much else in my scale so I just got that and a few bottles of paint.<br />\nMy other two days off were focused on the Bearcat. It was going together with a great flow so I kept with it. The overall construction of the plane is unorthodox. The wing goes through the fuselage instead of into it. The same goes for the horizontal stabilizers. This method leaves unsightly gaps to fill. The wing roots were filled all the way around the wing to close it all up. There was an opening for an external fuel tank that was filled in as well. The ordinance stores were removed and sanded along with the machine guns. I&#8217;ll give it a good sanding and prime it. Surely I will have to go another round or two. For the most part, this one is almost ready to paint.<br />\nThe Ju-88 is becoming &#8220;that kit&#8221;. The problems are arising in small areas like the engine nacelles. They didn&#8217;t want to fit correctly so I did the best I could. I am hopeful that it won&#8217;t be too bad to correct. I might try to get started tonight to get them out of the way. I haven&#8217;t delved too much further into the kit yet. I kind of want to take one issue on at a time.<br />\nThe Mohawk is moving along decently. I hope I added enough weight to the nose. My fingers are crossed. There are weights in the nose, behind the cockpit, and in the front of the SLAR pod. The basics are finished and I just need the time to sand the seams down so I can move forward. There will be a few small gaps to fill but so far so good. I am excited to get farther into this one.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/img_1569.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/img_1569.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_1569.JPG\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/img_1570.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/img_1570.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_1570.JPG\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/img_1571.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/img_1571.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_1571.JPG\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 1580, "location": false, "date": "11-08-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>The Ju-88 and the Mohawk are quickly reminding me of the Matchbox A-10 build a few months back.

The canopy had a severe fitting issue. There was a major gap behind the canopy that I really cannot believe that it was intended to fit like that. I sanded the canopy down as much as I could and filled the rest with glue. After the glue dries, I will add some filler wherever needed to finish the gaps off. The nose canopy had a terrible fit as well. I was able to make it fit with some strategic sanding. I&#8217;m hoping the &#8220;issues&#8221; are over with since all major construction is completed.

I used Camouflage Gray for the base color with Flanker Blue/Gray and Flanker Pale Blue. I used a set of Authentic Decals to finish it off. This was an unusually frustrating build for me.

Connect the dots and you have a 1&#8243; X 1&#8243; grid. For the holes, I used a 1/4&#8243; drill bit. Before drilling, I used duct tape to mark the drill bit to provide equal depth while not drilling completely through. I alternated drilling every other cross section to provide adequate space. After the drilling was complete, it was ready for the trial run. The first one was used on my B-57 build. The one pictured is helping my Emhar F3H-2 Demon come to fruition. They provide generous room to be able to work on multiple facets of my builds at the same time. Also, by building two, I can now comfortably build two kits simultaneously without mixing up parts. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/20130227-141955.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/20130227-141955.jpg\" alt=\"20130227-141955.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 358, "location": false, "date": "02-27-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["1/72 Emhar F3H-2N/2M Demon", "models", "airplane model", "airplanes", "emhar demon", "Emhar", "airplane", "model", "1/72"], "text": "<p>Sometimes it is difficult to find the motivation to continue through a build.

With a singular build, you accumulate a lot of down time waiting for paint to dry, filler to set, or glue to bond. While building two kits at once, you can count on quality building without the standstills.<br />\nFor my two kits, I have chosen Italeri&#8217;s 1/72 Sukhoi SU-34/32 Strike Flanker and Emhar&#8217;s 1/72 F-94C Starfire. So far, all that I have accomplished is some prep work on both kits. I&#8217;ve cut cockpit details, ordinance, and landing gear from the trees. I assembled and sanded the seams on the ordinance and they are ready for a base coat. I am quite unfamiliar with colors of Russian missiles so I will need to do some extensive research. I plan on giving the Flanker a digital camouflage paint scheme, in which I am a little apprehensive to try.<br />\nItaleri put some good detail in this Flanker. The landing gear looks fabulous and it comes with a full array of weapons. Emhar put out a basic kit. Not to much for details with this Starfire. I plan on searching for some after market details to liven it up.<br />\nI most definitely will be busy with these two kits.

While I am working towards completing these builds, I wanted to feature an earlier work of mine.<br />\nA good number of my builds start with me reading a book about a pilot that flew the particular aircraft. This was no exception. The idea of this build came from reading &#8220;Hero Found: The Greatest POW Escape of the Vietnam War&#8221;. It was a great read about Lt. Dieter Dengler. As a boy in war torn Germany, Dengler witnessed American fighters in flight over his hometown and forever changed his dreams. He came to the United States and proceeded to gain his citizenship. He ultimately became a pilot for the U.S. Navy. On his first mission over Laos, he was shot down and became a POW. The rest of the book details his life in a prison camp and his eventual escape and rescue.<br />\nHere we have two 1/72 Airfix A-1 Skyraiders. I wanted to give this diorama a feeling of movement so I added spinning propellers and built the wings of one Skyraider coming down from the folded position. I used a Fujimi Flight Deck Crew set for the figures and fire truck. This build was my introduction to weathering with pastels. You just can&#8217;t build a Skyraider without the unmistakeable exhaust stains. Luckily the decals were already the squadron of Lt. Dengler&#8217;s. I just had to make a few decals on my computer so they wouldn&#8217;t have the same numbers. I had fun with this build. I am a huge fan of the Skyraider and I am positive that if you were to ask a downed airman during the Vietnam War, he would feel the same.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/20130421-142314.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/20130421-142314.jpg\" alt=\"20130421-142314.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 408, "location": false, "date": "04-20-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["1/72 Emhar F-94C Starfire (Early)", "models", "airplane model", "airplanes", "Emhar", "1/72 italeri su-34/32 strike flanker", "airplane", "F-94", "model", "1/72"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/p1010856.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/p1010856.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=767\" alt=\"P1010856\"   class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-414\" /></a>Progress on my F-94 and Su-34 have been nothing short of satisfactory.

With most of the minor work finished (ordinance, landing gear, exhaust cans), I directed my focus on the planes themselves. The fuselage halves went together quite nicely on both kits with little need for filler. One round of sanding the seams and some filler has been completed. Tonight, I will  do more sanding and shoot a coat of primer on them. I&#8217;m betting on a little more filling and sanding on the Starfire, but the Flanker should be good to proceed.

My selection process is quite primitive. To choose my next kit, all I do is look through my stock and when a model intrigues me, I build it. I am lucky, or unlucky, enough to have a hobby shop&#8217;s selection of kits to choose from. I&#8217;m sure as my wife is reading this, alarm bells are going off and she is nodding her head in agreement. Anyway, this process seemed difficult this time around. There were an abundance of kits that I wanted to build. Among the candidates were (all in 1/72 scale) Hobby Craft&#8217;s CF-100 Canuck, Hasegawa&#8217;s EF-111A Raven, Fujimi&#8217;s MiG-21, Airfix&#8217;s A-4 Skyhawk, and about five others.<br />\nWhen this situation comes about, my next deciding factor is to look at the instructions and decals to see if one kit excites me more than the others. In this case, the EF-111A Raven caught my eye. Hasegawa made a great effort to put out a quality kit. The landing gear alone is enough incentive to take a spin with this one. The only downfall, in my opinion, is the cockpit. Not a whole lot going on in there. They provide decals for the instrument panels. A little scratch building will take care of that, though. The canopy is another problem in that you can&#8217;t build it in the open position. Careful cutting can resolve this issue as well. Other than that, this kit is a winner.<br />\nI haven&#8217;t gotten too far into the build yet, but so far it is going smooth. I have completed the exhaust cans and landing gear and now I will focus on the cockpit. This will be a good challenge to accomplish.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/20130619-110247.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/20130619-110247.jpg\" alt=\"20130619-110247.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 452, "location": false, "date": "06-19-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["1/72 hasegawa", "Chicago Blackhawks", "models", "airplane model", "airplanes", "hasegawa", "airplane", "Hasegawa EF-111A", "model", "1/72"], "text": "<p>While on vacation in Michigan, I didn&#8217;t devote much time to the construction of my EF-111A.

I wish that I could say that the effort involved was fruitful, but I don&#8217;t have a lot to show for myself. I took some extra time on the cockpit to add some details that were lacking and assembled the fuselage halves. This is where the problem lies. The fuselage is two pieces and the back half is the hassle for me. It seems that the bottom half is wider than the top half. I am going to have to add some shims to give the top half something to sit on. Lots of filling and sanding are on schedule for me in the days to come.<br />\nUnfortunately, the canopy only comes in the closed position. To remedy this, I carefully cut the two canopy doors off with a razor saw. I have a bit more scratch-building to do but that will come later.

I took some time over the weekend to tackle the issue and it turned out well. A lot of filling was still required, but not as much effort to correct the problem. If all goes well, I should be able to move closer to completion tonight. Aside from that issue, I was able to get the canopy finished. I carefully cut the canopy doors off with a razor saw, did some sanding, and completed the painting. As it sits, I have a few more solid hours to put into the Raven.

Aside from the dust and clutter, the most unappeasable matter was lack of real estate. Even building on the smaller scale of model kits has its boundaries. Solving this issue was not the easiest task at hand. I needed something to store my old kits in without the inevitable damage that was to be the result of my inadequate thinking process. Gratefully this wasn&#8217;t so. I recalled reading a &#8220;how to&#8221; article in Fine Scale Modeler on this topic. Shelving paper was used to line the bottom of a container and I delicately arranged my old kits to maximum capacity. Problem rectified. The liner prevents the kits from sliding free while the container protects them from the elements. I used the thin containers and slid them underneath my bed.

With the exception of my overreaction to the fuselage assembly, all else went well. There were a few minuscule fitting issues with the air intakes and the front landing gear strut. Nothing major but worth noting. The rest of construction was what I hoped for. I was able to add some detail in the cockpit as well as modifying the canopy to add some extra elements to view. I also gave extra attention to the exhaust cans to try and make them stand out a little more. I decided to add a photo-etched crew boarding ladder from P.P. Aeroparts. I have a love hate relationship with photo-etch parts but this experience was a good one. Assembly went smooth. Build time was about  twenty minutes. I used Model Master&#8217;s Dark Green for the final coat. I also sprayed Testor&#8217;s Flat White on a strip of masking tape and cut thin strips for the reflective tape.

Not that Tamiya put a bad kit on the market, but I think I&#8217;ll try a different company for my next Phantom build.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/20130910-221854.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/20130910-221854.jpg\" alt=\"20130910-221854.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/20130910-221904.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/20130910-221904.jpg\" alt=\"20130910-221904.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/20130910-221918.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/20130910-221918.jpg\" alt=\"20130910-221918.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 509, "location": false, "date": "09-11-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["1/72 academy super etenard", "1/72 academy", "models", "airplane model", "airplanes", "model airplane", "1/72 super etenard", "airplane", "model", "1/72"], "text": "<p>Talk about a pleasurable build.

The J.A.W.S. scheme was an intimidating paint scheme to attempt. There are a couple different schemes within the scheme. I chose to go with Light Ghost Gray as the base color with Military Brown, Olive Drab, and Dark Green for the spotted camouflage. As I did my research, I noticed the sloppiness of the application. In that regard, I decided to put my airbrush aside and paint all the camouflage by brush. It was a little difficult to let go and not have a smooth looking paint job. I think the end result came out great, though.<br />\nI used Hasegawa&#8217;s &#8220;Osan&#8221; kit for this build and it went together like a Hasegawa kit should.

After the base coat dried, I used Model Masters Metalizer Burnt Iron to highlight the ribbing on the fuselage. The final detail was the blue-ish over annealed look. Luckily for me, I work in a steel mill and know first hand what this looks like. I mixed two parts Testor&#8217;s Silver with one part Testor&#8217;s Dark Blue. For this detail, I lightly went over the burnt iron. Not too much, but just enough to see a difference. This was my first time using the metalizers so I hope I did it correctly. It was fairly simple to use. I didn&#8217;t need to thin down anything. The only downside is that you have to use a special kind of thinner.

My apprehensions on the blue paint were admonished quickly and I learned a few things from it.  </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/20131026-095257.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/20131026-095257.jpg\" alt=\"20131026-095257.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/20131026-095310.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/20131026-095310.jpg\" alt=\"20131026-095310.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/20131026-095322.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/20131026-095322.jpg\" alt=\"20131026-095322.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 567, "location": false, "date": "10-26-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["1/72 airfix", "!/72 Fujimi", "1/72 F-51D", "models", "airplane model", "airplanes", "model airplane", "Fujimi MiG-21", "airplane", "1/72", "Fujimi", "model", "Airfix F-51D", "1/72 MiG-21"], "text": "<p>As I entered into the decision making process for my next two builds, I noticed an extremely lopsided fact to my last twenty or so builds. In all of those kits, only three have been of the WWII era. It&#8217;s not that I do not care for that age of planes. It&#8217;s actually quite the opposite. There is nothing like seeing a warbird at a museum let alone hear their raw engines roaring. I very much appreciate and enjoy WWII era planes. Thus leading to my criteria for my next two builds. Criteria number one is that one has to be from WWII. The second criteria is not really a big deal. The kit just has to be from my &#8220;to build&#8221; list. Both kits were easy choices.<br />\nFor my WWII pick, I went with Airfix&#8217;s 1/72 F-51D Mustang. That isn&#8217;t a typo. The &#8220;P&#8221; designation was changed to &#8220;F&#8221; after the war. The Mustang will forever be from that era so I&#8217;ll let the history lesson slide.<br />\nI&#8217;m definitely not the biggest admirer of Airfix. I was skeptical in choosing this kit, but let&#8217;s hope looks aren&#8217;t deceiving. Upon opening the box, you&#8217;ll find a great looking kit staring back at you. The moulds are pristine with zero flashing. The weighted wheels are a surprising addition to any kit. Now I don&#8217;t have to dip into my True Details resin stash. I haven&#8217;t gotten far enough into this build to report any information. It looks like this kit might change my opinion on Airfix.<br />\nThe second build is Fujimi&#8217;s 1/72 scale MiG-21 MF Jayfighter. This aircraft has been on my radar for awhile and I&#8217;m pleased to finally get the chance to build it.<br />\nOpen the box and I&#8217;m guessing it&#8217;s like the many versions Fujimi offers. I have the &#8220;Humpback&#8221; kit and it&#8217;s the same as this one, part for part. The kit looks favorable with nice detail. The decals give you three options to build. I will be building the Iraqi version. The desert camouflage scheme is too hard to pass up. With Halloween tomorrow, I have my parental duties to take my children trick or treating leaving my hopes for some progress for the weekend. A worthy trade off in its own right. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/20131030-205406.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/20131030-205406.jpg\" alt=\"20131030-205406.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/20131030-205424.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/20131030-205424.jpg\" alt=\"20131030-205424.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 571, "location": false, "date": "10-31-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["1/72 hasegawa", "airplane model", "revell", "accurate miniatures", "1/72 academy", "models", "Fujimi", "1/72 heller", "1/72 airfix", "airplanes", "model airplane", "model", "1/72 Fujimi", "hasegawa", "Emhar", "1/72 trumpeter", "airplane", "1/72", "1/72 DML", "1/72 hobbyboss", "1/72 italeri"], "text": "<p>In an effort to give myself some new choices in what I build, I rotated my inventory.

When I joined the two fuselage halves together, it wasn&#8217;t so good. It seems as though the cockpit is too wide. I tried sanding a little off to no avail. After deciding to bite the bullet and take on my date with filling and sanding, I angrily bonded them together. I took some quality time yesterday to correct all the gap issues. Thanks to Tamiya&#8217;s wonderful filler, it wasn&#8217;t as awful as I thought. One round of the process and I should be ok. On a positive note, the wing halves went together beautifully.

I was able to get the underside painted last night and I should be able to get the first color of the camouflage on tonight.

It took a great deal of disappointment to find that Airfix did do well on some accounts. The Mustang made it through it&#8217;s turmoil and is ready for paint.<br />\nAfter the gap issues in the fuselage, it was a domino effect in the fitting of the wings. After some sanding and trimming, I was able to get a snug fit. I filled the gaps, sprayed and masked the anti-glare shield on the nose, and here we sit ready for the airbrush.

Cockpit detail was as expected. I added my usual details, of course. I included ejection handles and the canopy actuator, along with some tagging along the fuselage wall. The fuselage seamed together nicely. As a bonus, there was no need to fill and sand the spine due to the electronic hump. The wings couldn&#8217;t have had a better fit. There was no need for any filler whatsoever. All the other prep work went normal.<br />\nThe painting process proved to be the hardest part of the build. I sprayed the underside with Model Masters Duck Egg Blue. Unfortunately I thinned it a bit too much resulting in a few runs. I was able to correct it without having to reshoot the plane. I used 600 grit sand paper to knock the runs down followed by 1000 grit. For the other two colors I used Model Masters Dark Tan and Dark Earth. Overall a great build. Fujimi continues to set the standard in quality model kits. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/20131112-062401.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/20131112-062401.jpg\" alt=\"20131112-062401.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/20131112-075551.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/20131112-075551.jpg\" alt=\"20131112-075551.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/20131112-075642.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/20131112-075642.jpg\" alt=\"20131112-075642.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 591, "location": false, "date": "11-12-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>My hissy fit aside, this was a reminder that building models doesn&#8217;t get easy.

Now, I plan to steer clear as much as possible. I will admit I have been tempted recently to purchase a new one. Luckily, once I thought of the needless struggles, I moved on with relief.<br />\nSo here it is&#8230;..whew! I can start off by saying that this kit does have potential. The tooling is great with excellent recessed panel lines. The decals were another highlight of this build. It was the fit (or lack thereof) that upset the balance. If you&#8217;re looking for a challenge, this one might be for you.<br />\nOverall, I think I came out of this ok. I had originally planned to use Model Masters Metalizer for the paint, but I just wanted to put this one behind me. I opted to go with Chrome Silver. Decal application went great. I always dread using decals that follow form. The shark mouth went on well with little adjusting. Weathering this kit was a battle of my mind. I wanted to make it dirty without taking away the luster of a shiny airplane. I took it a little easy with the pastels.<br />\nSo it&#8217;s up on the shelf now.

Thanks to my WWII era initiative, they have drastically moved up in the pecking order.<br />\nUpon opening the box, you&#8217;ll find both kits in separate bags. Each kit is moulded in typical hasegawa fashion. There was some minor flashing on the Bf109. Nothing major, just a little unexpected. Everything else looks great. Cockpit detail is bare. The canopies come in the closed position making cockpit detail unnecessary. I added seat belts anyway. So far, these kits have been a pleasure to build. In a twenty-four hour period, the Bf-109E&#8217;s fuselage was complete and the wings were adhered with one round of filler into the roots.  Somehow I managed to brake the tail wheel off leading me to add some protection to the wing cannons. I cut thin strips of cardboard and taped them over the guns to keep my clumsy hands from causing any more damage.<br />\nIn that same time frame, I was able to get the fuselage together on the Spitfire. This build is most definitely going to be a quick one. I&#8217;ve taken two days away from the build and I am eager to get going again.

For any WWII plane, propellers have been a limitation. Stock propellers just don&#8217;t give the right look when you want a movement or flying effect. So what do we do when faced with adversity? We make our own. After some research, I could not find any tutorials on how to make your own spinning propellers. My next step was to try some trial and error. I looked at a few pictures to get the general idea. My dad gave me some clear plastic sheeting that he bought from Hobby Lobby and away I went. I took the stock propeller and layed it out on the plastic sheeting. Mark the center and all the tips of the propeller. Next you will need a compass. After you make your circle, you will need to drill a hole in the center. Once you&#8217;ve drilled your hole, you are ready to create your propeller. For props that have nose cones, you will want to mark where the propellers will come through the notches for a proper fit. Depending on the propeller, evenly space the proper amount of triangles onto the plastic. Scissors or an xacto knife will suffice to cut out your prop. After you cut the propeller out, give it a light sand, clean up any leftover marking and you are ready to paint. In this picture, I used flat black. I think for a better result, I will use clear matte next time. When you look at pictures, the propeller is somewhat transparent and I think the clear matte would give a more realistic look. Paint the tips of the propellers and assemble like normal. So that is my learning experience on an overlooked detail. Let&#8217;s keep making our planes fly.</p>\n", "post_id": 72, "location": false, "date": "07-07-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>At thirty-three years old, society considers me to be an adult.

Aside from all that, the rest of the build has gone surprisingly well. The fuselage went together nicely with one gap to fill and that was made by my own doing. Both fuselage halves came with a drop tank already attached to them. To make a cleaner and sleeker look, I sawed the halves away from the fuselage causing a slight gap.  A little Tamiya filler will do the trick.<br />\nAttaching the wings went just as well as the fuselage.  I think I will get by without needing any filler.

This kit was a breeze to put together. The few parts make for a quick assembly.<br />\nThis is most definitely a weekend build. I don&#8217;t recall having any problems from building to painting.  The decals were from 1994 so I decided to raid my spares and not get frustrated with old decals. unfortunately the Tigercat is a tail sitter and I did not add enough nose weight. I jammed as much in as I could from the nose of the plane back to the cockpit but it wasn&#8217;t enough. To rectify this problem, I cut a piece of clear sprue to size and attached it to the bottom of the tail section.<br />\nAll in all, I think on appearance alone, the Tigercat turned out as well as I had hoped for.

I&#8217;m sure that twenty years from now, my children will hold those same memories of me building away while they are running through the house playing.<br />\nIn honor of my 100th post, I have decided to build a few airplanes from the Century Series. I have already built an F-100 and an F-105. If you consider the F-111 to be included, then I have that taken care of as well. For my next builds, I have chosen to go with Hasegawa&#8217;s F-104 Starfighter and Meng&#8217;s F-102A Delta Dagger. I have been itching to get at theses kits for awhile and can&#8217;t think of a more convenient time to fit them in.<br />\nMy only progress has been to cut the pieces from the sprues and prepping them for paint. From the looks of the kits I should be able to excel at these. I have been wrong before, though.<br />\nTo add a completely unrelated kit to this set of builds, I have decided to throw in PM Models Lippisch P.13a. The Lippisch is another odd but revolutionary design from Germany. As my readers know, I have a soft spot for these types of aircraft. This kit isn&#8217;t the finest quality but I only paid $2.99 for it.  I can definitely make do.  The whole model consists of ten parts. Four of those parts make up the towing trolley leaving the other six for the airplane. The moulds aren&#8217;t the greatest, but certainly not awful. With a little elbow grease, this kit will be done quickly.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/20140210-165908.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/20140210-165908.jpg\" alt=\"20140210-165908.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 798, "location": false, "date": "02-10-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>Looking at my workbench, you would think that I have way too much going on. You might be right about that assessment.  Working on three kits at the same time can get a little crazy when it all ends up in the same place when I&#8217;m not working on them. I usually try to pick different types of aircraft to build so it won&#8217;t get confusing. This particular build is leaving me double checking where I place certain parts.  The Lippisch is no issue. It&#8217;s the F-104 and F-102 that get a little confusing at times. As the builds get more involved and the planes get built up, things should run a little smoother.<br />\nI made a great deal of progress on all three kits today. The F-104 and F-102 got all pre-painting finished. I can now proceed with cockpits, landing gear, and ordinance. The Lippisch made it through filling and sanding the main fuselage. I also was able to get the cart close to complete. I should be able to attach the cockpit/vertical stabilizer tomorrow and then comes the bulk of the &#8220;custom&#8221; work.  I dry fitted the canopy and noticed that it isn&#8217;t even close to a good fit. I&#8217;ll need to build up the perimeter to make it work. I also plan on making a bulkhead and adding a head rest behind the seat instead of having an empty space back there. I have a lot of tedious work ahead of me but I&#8217;m staying positive that it will work.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/20140211-173011.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/20140211-173011.jpg\" alt=\"20140211-173011.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 801, "location": false, "date": "02-11-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>Progress has been so so lately with the exception of today. The Lippisch has revealed it&#8217;s flaws while the scratch-building has been successful. The bulkhead and headrest have been installed while the rest of the cockpit has been put on hold. I put the vertical stabilizer/cockpit on the wing and the left side is oddly bloated. I keep reminding myself that this kit was only a couple of dollars. The first layer of filler was sanded and primed today shining light on the remaining gaps to be filled. Hopefully, I put the final round of filler on tonight so I can get back to the cockpit. My fingers are crossed.<br />\nThe success story of the day is the scratch-building of the in-flight refueling probe for the F-104. The kit I chose to build is Hasegawa&#8217;s &#8220;Red Baron&#8221; special edition kit. My intentions were always to build a different version of the Starfighter from this kit. I found it a while ago for $12.00 and figured I could scrounge my spares box or find after market sets to build a wartime F-104. Luckily, the kit came with everything that I needed except for decals, which I already had.<br />\n\tLeading up to the build, I decided that I wanted to build the &#8220;C&#8221; version. The F-104C was used during the Vietnam conflict and was painted in the SEA camouflage scheme. The obvious detail lacking from my kit is the in-flight refueling probe. While I was looking through my spares box for added detail to the Lippisch, I came across a spare probe from an F-100. Bingo! The hardest part had been solved. Next to build was the blister that the probe would fit into.<br />\n\tTo start, I researched the shape of the blister. It is a pretty basic design with clean angles. I cut three .8mm flat styrene strip pieces all the same length. I chose to give myself some insurance and cut the pieces longer than I needed. Next, I glued two of the pieces together in an off set then adding the third on top to form a triangle. After the glue set up, I used a razor saw to cut the excess of the hangover off. Using the razor saw again, I cut the front of the blister at an angle to resemble the real thing. I used sanding sticks to bring all the edges together and then used a 1/16&#8243; drill bit to drill out a hole to insert the probe into. The original probe was straight leading to a little shaping. The back of the blister will need to be cut at a taper as well but it will have to wait until I get a little farther into the build. Overall I think it will pass as acceptable. The whole process only took about twenty minutes to complete. It was an easy means to a big detail. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/20140214-230058.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/20140214-230058.jpg\" alt=\"20140214-230058.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 804, "location": false, "date": "02-15-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>In a perfect world, I would be typing positive words about the status of the Lippisch build.

With the build coming to a screeching halt, I was forced to order another kit. Two kits to be exact. I ordered a back up for my back up. Squadron had them on sale for $4.00 each which was a change of fortune. At least it wasn&#8217;t a pricey kit.<br />\n\tWhile I wait for my order to be delivered, I can now devote more energy into the F-104 and F-102. I started the cockpits tonight and was able to get the seat belts on the ejection seats as well as paint the headrests. I was also able to get the air intakes installed on the F-104 so I can finalize the refueling probe. Baby steps for now. The delay with the Lippisch should help me make some advantageous strides this week with the other two builds.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/20140217-215130.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/20140217-215130.jpg\" alt=\"20140217-215130.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/20140217-215139.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/20140217-215139.jpg\" alt=\"20140217-215139.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 808, "location": false, "date": "02-18-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>They say the waiting is the hardest part.

In other words, I get to regret having lost it in the first place.<br />\nI was able to steal a little time before work to get some build time in today. The F-104 and F-102 would require more time devoted to them than I had available, so I chose to work on the Lippisch some more. Even with the lost canopy, I still needed to build up the cockpit for it to fit correctly. With that still an issue, I started with the scrap styrene strip from the F-104&#8217;s refueling probe. First, I measured the length needed and cut it with my hobby knife. Next, I proceeded to dry fit the pieces to assure they were the correct length. With the length being satisfactory, I dry fit both pieces again and marked the width with a pencil. I adhered both pieces and let the glue dry.  I did some minimal sanding on both sides to even up the edges. I&#8217;ll need to add some filler after I get the new canopy. I think I am as far as I can go with it.

I don&#8217;t have as much progress to report, but I am still pretty far along.  I was able to sand out the filler and install the wings yesterday. Today, I touched up some more gaps and re-scribed the panel lines along the spine. I was also able to mask off the cockpit and get the anti-glare panels painted Flat Black.

I was able to recover from my poor performance last week and make some solid strides in both builds.<br />\nHasegawa&#8217;s Lightning is a mediocre kit with little detail. The kit has almost zero cockpit detail and boasts raised panel lines. However, it has been a pleasure to put together. My only mishap was when I had a little problem installing the right wing. The cutout on the fuselage was far to narrow to fit the wing root. The root itself was too long to properly fit. It kept hitting the opposite wing leaving a 1/8&#8243; gap. Some heavy sanding did the trick and I was able to move forward. As it sits, all major construction is complete. The underside made it to paint this afternoon with a coat of Testor&#8217;s Silver. I&#8217;ll try to mask it off tomorrow and get the second of three colors airbrushed.<br />\nFujimi&#8217;s MiG-29 has been a solid build so far. My only complaint is that the wings are to weak. I have had this problem before when I built my Su-27. The joint where the wings meet the fuselage is to weak and the slightest bend of the wing causes the filler to crack. Other than that, the rest has been great. I just finished the final sanding this morning and I hope to get the base coat of Model Master&#8217;s Fulcrum Gray on tonight or tomorrow. This paint job will take me a little while to complete. I am finally going to try the digital scheme on this kit. I&#8217;m a little apprehensive about the attempt, but I guess I can always paint over it.<br />\nThis weekend also brought a third build into the mix. No, I haven&#8217;t learned my lesson from the Lippisch build. I&#8217;ll just keep pushing the limits. Thanks to Rich at themodelgallery for the inspiration. He has built a 1/48 scale and a 1/72 scale Stuka. Who doesn&#8217;t love the Stuka? I have dug out Italeri&#8217;s 1/72 scale Ju-87 D-5 version. That&#8217;s about as far as I am on this one.

Luckily the snow didn&#8217;t bring polar temperatures with it and I was able to get the Lightning completely airbrushed with two sessions. This morning, I sprayed Model Masters RAF Dark Sea Gray and let it dry for a few hours. My second session at the airbrush, I used Model Masters RAF Dark Green to finish out the camouflage. I let that dry and then I pulled all the masking off. I&#8217;ll hit it with a gloss coat tonight and hopefully decal it tomorrow.<br />\nMy MiG-29 is coming along just as well. I finished the main construction and airbrushed the base color of Model Masters Fulcrum Gray this morning. I let it dry till this afternoon and masked off the nose and tips of the vertical stabilizers so I could paint them. I left the vertical stabilizers off the kit to make it easier when I am painting the digital scheme. I used a rattle can to spray the parts instead of using my airbrush. I got a little lazy and did&#8217;t want to clean it out for a fourth time today. Nothing against spray cans, I just usually don&#8217;t care for the results as opposed to using an airbrush.

This kit, unfortunately, lacked in the cockpit as well as obvious details. There was zero effort to open up the air intake or provide any engines. Both the bow and aft ends of the fuselage are closed off. I painted them flat black to hopefully hide the disappointment. Other than those issues, assembly went wonderfully.

The Germans used a white wash in the winter over the summer camouflage, leading to inconsistencies and some thinner spots that show the &#8220;old&#8221; camouflage through the white.

I wanted, so badly, not to forego the winter scheme and safely finish the kit. The risk was great, but the reward was greater. I took my time at the airbrush spraying the white on in thin layers. I slowly built up the paint in different areas to show the inconsistency of the field application. The end result s a great looking paint job.

The first pick is Revell&#8217;s Stearman Kaydet. A few months ago, I came across a picture of a Stearman painted in a zebra-ish paint scheme. These planes were called recall planes. They were essentially used to bring in all the training pilots that were in the air. When you saw the very definitive paint scheme, you knew it was time to head back to the field.

It looks like a typical Academy kit so I kind of know what to expect.<br />\nThe final plane is actually yielding two kits. Also from Academy, I am building two A6M5c Zero&#8217;s.

During WWII, Japanese pilot, Tadayoshi Koga, crashed his Zero on Akutan Island in Alaska. As luck would have it, a PBY pilot noticed the wreck and recorded the position of the aircraft. To make a long story short, we recovered the Zero and restored it to exploit the aircrafts weaknesses. So I decided to build the restored version with American markings. Then I got to thinking that I should do a before and after build. That&#8217;s where the second Zero comes into play. The plan is to build Petty Officer Koga&#8217;s Zero as it would have looked before the crash. The second plane will be the after version in a bare metal paint job. I&#8217;ll have to do some more research before I get too involved, though. Some custom decals are probably on the docket as well. I&#8217;m looking forward to getting these two added to the shelf.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/20140402-214157.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/20140402-214157.jpg\" alt=\"20140402-214157.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 966, "location": false, "date": "04-03-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>It&#8217;s officially the weekend and now is the time where I make my progress on all of my awaiting builds. The four kits sitting on my workbench are no exception. I have been crawling throughout the week spending a few mini-sessions prepping for this weekends push.<br />\nThe Stearman is leading the way with all major construction finished. I need to do a little masking before it&#8217;s ready for an overall coat of flat white. After the white, I&#8217;ll mask off all the striping and spray it with a dark blue. This one should tentatively be done soon.<br />\nMy progress on the twin Zeros is better than expected. As you can see in the picture, I have the fuselage halves together along with the wings. They both look like minimal sanding will be required with little or no filler needed as well. The plan is to have these ready for paint by Monday.<br />\nThe Avenger doesn&#8217;t look like I have done much, but I really have. All the cockpit work is complete and installed. I would have the fuselage halves together if it weren&#8217;t for the rear machine gunners turret. I was hoping to mask the hole and get the plane painted before I installed the turret. It turns out that I can&#8217;t take that route. Now I will paint the turret first, then install it and just mask it when I mask the cockpit off. Not a favorite option, but problem solved. I also installed the windows in the fuselage.<br />\nClear parts are a bit of a downer on WWII planes. It&#8217;s mainly in bombers, but the Avenger sports interior windows that need to be masked off. I have found a way to do this with ease. First, I glue the window in as usual. Second, I take a piece of packing tape (cut to size) and place it over the interior side of the window.  After the glue dries, the tape secures the window enough to easily mask it off. No more windows falling out during paint prep.<br />\nIt seems that the Avenger will be the last to complete. Although I have been wrong many times before. Regardless, this is a great kit so far.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/20140405-155726.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/20140405-155726.jpg\" alt=\"20140405-155726.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/20140405-155733.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/20140405-155733.jpg\" alt=\"20140405-155733.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/20140405-155738.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/20140405-155738.jpg\" alt=\"20140405-155738.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 974, "location": false, "date": "04-05-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>My progress has been sluggish this week.

I couldn&#8217;t find the exact color in my research, so I used Tamiya Sea Blue. It&#8217;ll be close enough. I&#8217;ll pull the mask off later today and do some slight detail work before I apply the decals.<br />\nThe Avenger is my success story of the week. The fuselage halves were put together Thursday night. Last night saw the seams get sanded and primed. This turkey will get its wings on this afternoon and any gaps that need to be filled will get taken care of as well.<br />\nPainting on the Zeros is at an in-between stage. The Japanese Zero will get painted this afternoon. The American Zero will get a little more detail to its finish. I sprayed the entire plane with Testors Silver this morning for two reasons. One, it acts as a good primer for bare metal finishes. The silver shows all the imperfections in the plastic, such as scratches from sanding, that could ruin your final appearance. Second, I want to break up the finish with some different variations of silver. I&#8217;ll mask off a few random panels before I airbrush the final coat of paint, giving the Zero a little contrast.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/20140412-131204.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/20140412-131204.jpg\" alt=\"20140412-131204.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/20140412-131218.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/20140412-131218.jpg\" alt=\"20140412-131218.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/20140412-131227.jpg\"><img src=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/20140412-131227.jpg\" alt=\"20140412-131227.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 985, "location": false, "date": "04-12-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>This weekend sprouted many sessions at the workbench. I was able to finish two builds and get close to finishing the other two kits. The first to be cleared for takeoff is the Stearman.<br />\nMy timeline for this build was pathetic. Given the small amount of pieces along with the total size of the kit, this should have been done last week. Regardless, here I am with the Stearman complete.<br />\nThe build itself went quite well. Very little sanding was needed along with zero filler. The painting actually took longer to complete than the build itself.<br />\nThe recall paint scheme came out better than I expected. I was a little worried the blue would bleed through the mask and make a huge mess. Thankfully, pulling the mask off revealed crisp blue stripes.<br />\nI went in a different direction with the weathering on this one. A recall plane would stay relatively clean so I wanted to show cleanliness with a little bit of weathering. Instead of using pastels, I used a #2 pencil on the panel lines to give a minor amount of wear.<br />\nAnother new technique for me was the rigging. I&#8217;ve tried to pull this off before with horrid results. This time I approached the preparation in a different way. In the past, when I gave it a shot, I tried to use black thread for rigging. It has always ended up with me getting frustrated because the thread wouldn&#8217;t be tight enough without pulling the opposite end loose. This time, I stretched a foot long thread, taped at both ends to a pair of spray cans. I coated it with super glue and let it dry. When it&#8217;s ready, you&#8217;ll have plenty of stiff rigging to use. This time was much easier using this method. Also, it adds a great detail to the kit.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amateurairplanes.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/20140413-221838.jpg\"><img

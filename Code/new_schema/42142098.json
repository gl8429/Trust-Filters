I thought this would make a good gift for my sister, we used to play it during the Seventies and the box was identical to the one we used to have.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/alisonsye11.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1005\" alt=\"alisonsye1\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/alisonsye11.jpg?w=300&#038;h=233\" width=\"300\" height=\"233\" /></a></p>\n<p>It was sealed with a ridiculous amount of sellotape, but the lady assured me that it had been checked and that all of the pieces were inside. However, when I got home and opened it &#8211; not a mouse in sight. Instead, some old Monopoly parts.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/alisonsye21.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1006\" alt=\"alisonsye2\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/alisonsye21.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<p>I thought they were 1960s, at first, but after some research I discovered that they are nearer 1950s. Exciting, but I didn&#8217;t quite take that in until this morning, when it suddenly dawned on me that the cards I have been sewing all week are sixty years old. Turns out, the metal counters were made after the war and represent the power and rebuilding of Britain. The piece I thought was a tractor, is a bulldozer. I am going to add the counters to our family set, which is ultra-modern, each player actually uses a credit card. The children love it. From now on, though, I shall be moving this Mallard around our board.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/alisonsye.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1007\" alt=\"alisonsye\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/alisonsye.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\n<p>Anyway, an unplanned week of frenzied sewing ensued. A bonus unexpected day off work, on Thursday, helped. My accounts were not completed (and many pans boiled dry), but the cards were. I have never had such a quick turnaround from acquiring the goods, to transforming them into the finished piece. Sometimes I sit on things for years before turning them into something new.</p>\n<p>The peak of the week was when I had the idea to include a Community Chest or Chance Card, and some money, with each card. Hello!</p>\n<p>They are not made from my usual food packaging, but instead from some WH Smith&#8217;s index cards. The index cards were bought new by a friend. She never used them and gave them to me last Sunday, rather than throw them away. So they were still in my bag when I bought Mousie-Mousie, seemed only right to use them here. The envelopes, I bought some years ago from a charity shop, I have just adapted them for purpose.</p>\n<p>I am now going to put a few in my <a href=\"http://folksy.com/shops/alisonsye\" target=\"_blank\">shop</a> (not Northumberland Avenue, though &#8211; more on that later).</p>\n<p>Hope you like them,</p>\n<p>Alison</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1008\" style=\"width: 310px\"

206</strong></p>\n<p>Ages ago, I&#8217;m thinking about five years, I made a hundred of these reindeer postcards.</p>\n<p>Months and months I spent making them, our tiny house in Hither Green was covered in little orange shreds of card. Then I posted them, all but two, to people who I thought might be interested in my work. I had one reply by email, from a true gent in Gateshead. He wanted to let me know how much he liked it. His words were very much appreciated, and I still think of them sometimes. Anyway, so is life.</p>\n<p>I \u00a0rediscovered little Rudolf recently, and thought to myself I might make some more, only this time using my <a href=\"http://alisonsye.wordpress.com/2013/03/27/1-red-shirts/\" target=\"_blank\">red shirts</a> for the noses. I called myself The Upcyclist in those days, so I&#8217;ve updated the card by adding my name and remounting it. I can&#8217;t remember anything about the map I used, but this section is the English Channel.</p>\n<p>You can find this card in my <a href=\"http://folksy.com/shops/alisonsye\" target=\"_blank\">shop</a>.</p>\n<p>All I need to do now, is find the last remaining card. I put it somewhere &#8216;safe&#8217; so I could give it to a friend. The reindeer was standing on Margate, which is particularly fitting for this friend. If you&#8217;re reading C, you&#8217;ll get it one day.</p>\n<p>I have not mentioned the &#8216;C&#8217; word once (well, apart from my friend), but apologies anyway.</p>\n<p>Have a great weekend,</p>\n<p>Alison x</p>\n", "post_id": 1042, "location": false, "date": "09-20-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Art", "Collage", "art gallery", "eco", "Uniform", "buttons", "VSA", "upcycle", "alisonsye", "Embroidery", "London", "red shirts", "original"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/alisonsye4.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1054\" alt=\"alisonsye\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/alisonsye4.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=821\"   /></a></p>\n<p><strong>261</strong></p>\n<p>A very windy Friday, here in London.</p>\n<p>Some of you know that I like to have a little lunch time sewing on the go, at all times. I finished this little button piece \u00a0about three weeks ago now, but just haven&#8217;t managed to write a post about it. \u00a0It has been made using the buttons from my colleagues&#8217; shirts, mainly during my lunch breaks in the gallery. There is really good light in the kitchen, despite it being further underground than the Northern Line.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s funny, but when I look at all of my work there is always something I am reminded of, something that was happening at the time of its making. A conversation, something on television, something I was cooking.\u00a0Below is what I will think about whenever I look at these particular buttons.</p>\n<p>The red fabric, onto which the buttons are sewn, is my very own actual shirt, by the way. I won&#8217;t bore you with the name of the person who once wore each individual button, but I know, and they are all noted.</p>\n<p>Have a great weekend,</p>\n<p>Alison</p>\n<p><strong>Sunday 22nd September</strong></p>\n<p>Today, I was sitting in the kitchen at work sewing my buttons, whilst listening to the conversation going on around me.</p>\n<p><em>If you don&#8217;t know, &#8216;VSA&#8217; is Visitor Services Assistant, which is one of my jobs.

In the meantime, I apologise if you see an unwanted/unagreed-to advert.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1059\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/alisonsyes225b.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1059\" alt=\"225\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/alisonsyes225b.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=740\"   /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">225</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_1060\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/alisonsyes226b.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1060\" alt=\"226\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/alisonsyes226b.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=733\"   /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">226</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_1061\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/alisonsyes227b.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1061\" alt=\"227\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/alisonsyes227b.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=850\"   /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">227</p></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1062\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/alisonsyes228b.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1062\" alt=\"228\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/alisonsyes228b.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=903\"   /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">228</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_1063\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/alisonsyes229b.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1063\" alt=\"229\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/alisonsyes229b.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=711\"   /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">229</p></div>\n<p><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/alisonsyepgroupinside.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1064\" alt=\"alisonsyePgroupinside\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/alisonsyepgroupinside.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=705\"   /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/alisonsyepmedicinebottle.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1065\" alt=\"alisonsyePmedicinebottle\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/alisonsyepmedicinebottle.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=495\"   /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 1057, "location": false, "date": "09-27-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Collage", "Art", "patchwork", "Pat Hutchins", "eco", "1972", "postcard", "Duck", "alisonsye", "Embroidery", "Mrs Yates", "cereal box", "original", "upcycle"], "text": "<div id=\"attachment_1084\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/alisonsyes207.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1084\" alt=\"207\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/alisonsyes207.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=821\"   /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">207</p></div>\n<p><strong>Numbers: 207 &#8211; 216</strong></p>\n<p>To recap, I am clearing out my &#8216;stock&#8217; whilst searching for something from 1973. I keep finding stuff and getting sidetracked.</p>\n<p>One of the things I unearthed, was the remains of The Surprise Party by the wonderful Pat Hutchins. It was first published in 1970, but this edition is from 1972 (so close).</p>\n<p>Pat Hutchins won a scholarship to Darlington School of Art (a few miles from my home town) in 1958. She has written and illustrated about 50 books, and given countless children lots of pleasure over the years. One of these children was me. I can remember the lovely Mrs. Yates reading this to my class when I was sixish. Mrs. Yates was a hippy, and I loved her. I was totally beguiled by the illustrations. Here was a person who had outlined her images in dark green, not black. Was that allowed? I think I can trace my colourful sewing outlines right back to Pat Hutchins, now I come to think about it.</p>\n<p>A few years back, I made a few little cards with this book. It was before I discovered the internet and blogging, so I have no record of these. Some sold and some didn&#8217;t. When I acquired the book, it was damp and moldy. I usually accommodate scribbles and sellotape, and incorporate these into my work, but I figure nobody wants mold and I always amputate \u00a0it. The pages that I recently found did not have mold on them and were too good to cut into little squares. I remember thinking that I would put them somewhere safe and eventually use them for postcards, that way the illustrations wouldn&#8217;t need to be cut. I was so excited when I rediscovered these pages, that I stopped my &#8216;sorting&#8217; and immediately started making.</p>\n<p>The result is ten pretty large postcards, which have been made with used food packaging.</p>\n<p>I will put a few into my<a href=\"http://folksy.com/shops/alisonsye\" target=\"_blank\"> shop</a>. If the one you like isn&#8217;t there, please give me a shout.</p>\n<p>If you prefer my folded cards, there are five left from my original make a few years ago. My intention is to remount them over the weekend, and post some pictures on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>The images below are quite small, but I think if you click on them you will see a larger version.</p>\n<p>Have a lovely weekend,</p>\n<p>Alison x</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1087\" style=\"width: 253px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/alisonsyes208.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1087\" alt=\"208\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/alisonsyes208.jpg?w=243&#038;h=300\" width=\"243\" height=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">208</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_1088\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/alisonsyes209.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1088\" alt=\"209\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/alisonsyes209.jpg?w=300&#038;h=230\" width=\"300\" height=\"230\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">209</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_1089\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/alisonsyes210.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1089\" alt=\"210\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/alisonsyes210.jpg?w=300&#038;h=226\" width=\"300\" height=\"226\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">210</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_1090\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/alisonsyes211.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1090\" alt=\"211\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/alisonsyes211.jpg?w=300&#038;h=212\" width=\"300\" height=\"212\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">211</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_1091\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/alisonsyes212.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1091\" alt=\"212\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/alisonsyes212.jpg?w=300&#038;h=208\" width=\"300\" height=\"208\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">212</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_1092\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/alisonsyes213.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1092\" alt=\"213\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/alisonsyes213.jpg?w=300&#038;h=214\" width=\"300\" height=\"214\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">213</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_1093\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/alisonsyes214.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1093\" alt=\"214\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/alisonsyes214.jpg?w=300&#038;h=229\" width=\"300\" height=\"229\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">214</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_1094\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/alisonsyes215.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1094\" alt=\"215\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/alisonsyes215.jpg?w=300&#038;h=223\" width=\"300\" height=\"223\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">215</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_1095\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/alisonsyes216.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1095\" alt=\"216\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/alisonsyes216.jpg?w=300&#038;h=230\" width=\"300\" height=\"230\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">216</p></div>\n<p><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/alisonsyes212b.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1096\" alt=\"alisonsyeS212b\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/alisonsyes212b.jpg?w=300&#038;h=211\" width=\"300\" height=\"211\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 1073, "location": false, "date": "10-04-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Penguin", "Collage", "1995", "eco", "postcard", "alisonsye", "Portobello Road", "Art", "books", "London", "Sarah McMenemy", "Embroidery", "cereal box", "Muriel Spark", "Notting Hill", "original", "market", "upcycle"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/alisonsyes243.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1079\" alt=\"alisonsyeS243\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/alisonsyes243.jpg?w=830&#038;h=1024\"   /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Number: 243</strong></p>\n<p>Louise, one of my lovely customers, has asked me if I have anything from 1973, with which to make her boyfriend a card.</p>\n<p>Using this as an excuse, I have been slowly sorting through my &#8216;stock&#8217;. The trouble is, I keep finding exciting things I had forgotten about, which leads \u00a0promptly to making something.</p>\n<p>On Saturday I found myself with the house to myself, and the cover from &#8216;The Portobello Road&#8217; by Muriel Spark in my hand. I love Muriel Spark, The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie is one of my favourite books, although I have never read this story.</p>\n<p>I came about the cover from this book in a sad fashion.</p>\n<p>About eight years ago, I was unexpectedly ill. There was a point when I though I was dying. It is not apparent to the casual observer, but I am still not over it, nowhere near over it. To cut a very long story short, my illness was due to some botched-up dental work done some fifteen years earlier. A dental job had gone wrong, this resulted in a skin graft in hospital. The skin graft was done incorrectly, sealing in an infection. An infection which secretly grew and grew, until eight years ago my body had a massive allergic reaction. Every joint was swollen and I could not move. Every month or so I went to hospital and had the joints &#8216;drained&#8217;, upon which they immediately refilled. I was in a wheelchair at first, and then crutches. I couldn&#8217;t even move my jaw, much to the relief of some.</p>\n<p>The trouble was, we had no idea what was wrong with me. I had test after test. Nothing. Until two years ago I was lucky enough to see a new dentist, Mark. Mark had me to the hospital within a week. I had had every part of my body x-rayed loads of times, but nobody had thought to do my head. It was filled with &#8216;matter&#8217;. Problem solved. Almost.</p>\n<p>It sounds \u00a0stupid saying this, but the hardest part was finding out who genuinely cared about me and who didn&#8217;t. My heart was broken during that period, and it is proving a lot harder to fix than my joints.</p>\n<p>Here is just one little story.</p>\n<p>A lot of people didn&#8217;t know I was ill until about three months into my illness, when my absence was suddenly noted. My friend T came round to see me. As it turned out she didn&#8217;t actually come to see me, as always she came to ask something of me. We have been friends since the age of sixteen. When you can&#8217;t move and you are in pain, there is pretty much nothing to do other than think.Thinking. Too much thinking can be a bad thing. I thought about all the things I had done for T over the years, not just me, the rest of this particular friendship group had done a lot for her as well. Between us, we had pretty much spoonfed this woman. I tried to think of a favour I had ever asked of her, I couldn&#8217;t think of a single one. Despite the fact that she was one of my few friends who had a car at the time, she never, ever brought me any food packaging. I thought about my friends who never visited me without making deep red marks in their hands from carrying one to many cereal boxes on the bus. Some people just take and never give. I had never noticed.</p>\n<p>Anyway, back to the day of her visit (did I say it was my birthday, by the way? I had honestly not been bothered that I always sent her a card, and that we always went out for a drink for her birthday, yet she still didn&#8217;t know my birth date. \u00a0Suddenly, after 23 years, it mattered). She asked me how I was doing. I told her that it was very difficult and painful \u00a0to move my hands to sew, and I was really missing it. Ignoring this, she produced a load of stuff from her bag and asked me if I could make a collage for her mum&#8217;s birthday (did I mention that she had been to art college too?). And I thought my joints were painful. This pain was worse, still is worse.</p>\n<p>One of the things she gave me was this Muriel Spark book. She had bought the book especially for the job &#8220;It was only 60p, one of the Mini Penguin Classics&#8221;, and she proceeded to tear off the cover, right before my eyes. Did she know me at all?</p>\n<p>Of course, I spent my birthday weekend making the collage. I could not bring myself to use the book cover, though. Many tears fell on that work. I will not be making anything else for T.</p>\n<p>So, I found the cover in my clearout and made this little postcard. Maybe, by way of a little therapy.</p>\n<p>The cover illustration is beautiful and was done by Sarah McMenemy. This edition was printed in 1995.</p>\n<p>I am putting it in my <a href=\"http://folksy.com/shops/alisonsye\" target=\"_blank\">shop</a>, although I can&#8217;t think who would want to buy it after that hard sell! It is lovely, though. I feel better for having made it, and looking at it now is making me smile. \u00a0I don&#8217;t know what the market is like nowadays, as I haven&#8217;t been for years, but it used to be great. And then there is that fantastic scene from &#8216;Notting Hill&#8217;, where Hugh Grant walks through the market and the seasons change. Is that Portobello Road or have I just fantasized it?</p>\n<p>Alison.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/alisonsyes243b.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1080\" alt=\"alisonsyeS243b\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/alisonsyes243b.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=842\"   /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 1076, "location": false, "date": "09-29-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["1967", "Wildsmith", "1969", "birds"], "text": "<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>Numbers: 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47 and 48</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Enjoyed every minute of making these postcards, I&#8217;ve just put a couple in <a href=\"http://folksy.com/shops/alisonsye\" target=\"_blank\">my shop</a>.

remember, but only selling them for about ten years. Until I became internet-friendly, I always managed to make my customers a few christmas cards to say &#8216;Thank you&#8217;.</p>\n<p>I was determined to reintroduce this tradition this year.</p>\n<p>I had a book in mind for the job, but then I stumbled upon a stash of used wrapping paper. I&#8217;m pretty certain that the paper was originally from Paperchase, although I could be wrong.</p>\n<p>I have used two designs, and made postcards using my usual cereal boxes. I am not going to show all the cards, they are very similar and it would be tedious.</p>\n<p>I am experimenting with packaging, and although the lady in the post office said there would be no problem with sewn envelopes (made from old copies of Completely London), I am a little worried they won&#8217;t get to you. If you have the time, could you please let me know when they arrive? If all of the envelopes arrive safely, and in one piece, then I may continue to package my stuff in this way. Be honest, let me know if you have any problems, I would appreciate the feedback. It also bothers me that I have used new, unused tissue paper to wrap the cards. I need to come up with an alternative.</p>\n<p>Anyway, if you have bought a card (or cards) from me this year, a few of these are on their way to you (C, I will give you yours when I see you). It has been lovely getting to know you all, thank you and I hope you like the cards.</p>\n<p>See you on Friday,</p>\n<p>Alison</p>\n<p>P.S.

No surprise to me, though, that I manged to do loads of making without the seductions of the internet.</p>\n<p>First up, ten little new home cards. I&#8217;m really pleased with these. Made, as usual, from used food packaging and clothes which have seen better days.</p>\n<p>Mostly, I tend to use fabrics which happen to be in front of me, rather than hunting for stuff. So if you recognise anything here, that is because I used it to make my recent Picasso piece (it&#8217;s his birthday today, by the way, 1881). All of the houses are made from those <a href=\"http://alisonsye.wordpress.com/2013/03/27/1-red-shirts/\" target=\"_blank\">red shirts</a> (will I ever get to the end of the pile?), the doors and windows are made from Del&#8217;s shirt and my daughter&#8217; skirt, the yellow roofs are Jade&#8217;s dress. You can read more about these clothes <a href=\"http://alisonsye.wordpress.com/2013/09/16/1-picassos-meal/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Some of the roofs are made from a map, it was a page from a magazine. I have no idea about the magazine or the page. Maybe some of you might recognise it?</p>\n<p>There are two new clothes items:</p>\n<p>Purple gingham dress. Very special. I bought this in Scope, Lewisham, 2005. My daughter was three at the time, and was with me and a buggy-load of the usual fruit and veg we had just bought at the market. It must&#8217;ve been a Friday. It was a beautiful little shift dress that someone had hand-made for a small girl. It was perfect. There was a small red felt-tip mark at the hem, which I did not try to remove. My daughter wore it for years, first as a dress and then as a top over leggings. There are too many happy memories to mention in which this dress was present.</p>\n<p>Green blouse with yellow floral print. My mam&#8217;s. She likes to wear synthetic clothing, which I don&#8217;t normally use in my work. However, she wore this to my sister&#8217;s graduation. It was perfect for the little hill on which every house stands.</p>\n<p>I have made ten of these houses, each one is different. They will not be repeated, these will be the only ten. A couple can be found in my <a href=\"http://folksy.com/shops/alisonsye\" target=\"_blank\">shop</a>.</p>\n<p>Have a great weekend,</p>\n<p>Alison</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1134\" style=\"width: 280px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/alisonsyes230.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1134\" alt=\"230\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/alisonsyes230.jpg?w=270&#038;h=300\" width=\"270\" height=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">230</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_1135\" style=\"width: 221px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/alisonsyes231envelope.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1135\" alt=\"231\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/alisonsyes231envelope.jpg?w=211&#038;h=300\" width=\"211\" height=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">231</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_1136\" style=\"width: 306px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/alisonsyes232.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1136\" alt=\"232\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/alisonsyes232.jpg?w=296&#038;h=300\" width=\"296\" height=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">232</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_1137\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/alisonsyes233b.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1137\" alt=\"233\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/alisonsyes233b.jpg?w=300&#038;h=156\" width=\"300\" height=\"156\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">233</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_1138\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/alisonsyes234.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1138\" alt=\"234\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/alisonsyes234.jpg?w=290&#038;h=300\" width=\"290\" height=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">234</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_1139\" style=\"width: 266px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/alisonsyes235.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1139\" alt=\"235\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/alisonsyes235.jpg?w=256&#038;h=300\" width=\"256\" height=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">235</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_1140\" style=\"width: 299px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/alisonsyes236.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1140\" alt=\"236\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/alisonsyes236.jpg?w=289&#038;h=300\" width=\"289\" height=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">236</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_1141\" style=\"width: 284px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/alisonsyes237.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1141\" alt=\"237\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/alisonsyes237.jpg?w=274&#038;h=300\" width=\"274\" height=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">237</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_1142\" style=\"width: 274px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/alisonsyes238.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1142\" alt=\"238\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/alisonsyes238.jpg?w=264&#038;h=300\" width=\"264\" height=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">238</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_1143\" style=\"width: 304px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/alisonsyes239.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1143\" alt=\"239\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/alisonsyes239.jpg?w=294&#038;h=300\" width=\"294\" height=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">239</p></div>\n<p><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/alisonsyephouseinside.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1144\" alt=\"alisonsyePhouseinside\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/alisonsyephouseinside.jpg?w=300&#038;h=206\" width=\"300\" height=\"206\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 1132, "location": false, "date": "10-25-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Art", "Collage", "Ladybird Book", "original", "Children", "christmas card", "eco", "christmas tree", "upcycle", "alisonsye", "Embroidery", "Martin Aitchison", "recycle", "cereal box", "Christmas"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/alisonsye486up.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1167\" alt=\"alisonsye486up\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/alisonsye486up.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=768\"   /></a></p>\n<p><strong>3a Things We Like by W. Murray, illustrated by Martin Aitchison. Ladybird.</strong></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s about a year since I first started to interfere with social media. Those of you who have known me since the start will know that I used to be called Upcyclist. Sounds a bit pompous now. I had been making stuff under this name for quite few years before joining Twitter (my first venture into modern life), which I loved. I then joined Facebook, which I hated.</p>\n<p>After a while, I realised that I really should use my name, it seemed like I was hiding. So I started again, using Alison Sye.</p>\n<p>The trouble is, I have spent years making cards, which now display old website information. They are all individually numbered, I got well into the 600s before starting again at number 1 as Alison Sye. None of the Upcyclist numbers are recorded, so you won&#8217;t find any details on this blog. To be honest, I can&#8217;t remember most of the details about the books and materials I used. Actually, this was my sole reason for starting a blog. I used to try and fit as much information about the book&#8217;s history onto the back of the card. It was ridiculous, my cards are pretty small. I wanted the buyer to know all the stuff involved in the making, but it was taking ages to record, one at a time.</p>\n<p>And so this blog began. The idea being that you look up the number of your piece, and find the story. I do feel bad, though, that I am excluding non-internet-friendly folk. Some of my best friends are non-internet-friendly folk. Niffs!</p>\n<p>Recently I found some christmas tree cards, made from an old Ladybird book. Like I said, I didn&#8217;t think to write down too many details at the time, so I don&#8217;t know the date or how I acquired the book. Most of the stuff I used then was given to me by local schools and libraries when they were having a clear out. I had &#8216;inside-men&#8217;, as it were. I do know, though, that this book is at least thirty-five years old.

This edition was published in 1977 by The Windmill Press.</strong></p>\n<p>Last week I talked about the fact that I used to be called <a href=\"alisonsye.wordpress.com/2013/11/1/upcyclist/\" target=\"_blank\">Upcyclist</a>, and that I am going to be selling off my old cards at a reduced rate.</p>\n<p>Well, here are said cards, although there are more in my <a href=\"http://folksy.com/shops/alisonsye\" target=\"_blank\">shop</a>.</p>\n<p>The illustrations are by the wonderful Aliki. At the time of making these cards I had never heard of her, and had written her name on the card info&#8217; without giving it much thought. I remember thinking it was strange the illustrator only had a single name, and shamefully thought it was a man. Aliki has since become one of my heros (I have a small collection), so I was amazed when I opened the shoe box (all of my cards are kept in shoe boxes) to discover who had done the illustrations. It wasn&#8217;t that I had forgotten the book, I remembered it vividly, I just hadn&#8217;t taken on board the name of the illustrator.</p>\n<p>Very sorry for the short post, it is my daughter&#8217;s birthday, hence the cake at the top, which she made herself, and don&#8217;t think I don&#8217;t feel bad about it!</p>\n<p>Have a great weekend,</p>\n<p>Alison x</p>\n<p>PS.

I used to carry it to school every Tuesday, \u00a0between 1979 and 1980.

When I say &#8216;music lessons&#8217;, understand that I am not talking about private lessons where you eventually come away being able to play an instrument. I don&#8217;t come from the kind of family who do that sort of thing. I mean a &#8216;music lesson&#8217; in a rough-as-hell comprehensive school in the North- East of England, where the teacher split the class in half and we sang London&#8217;s Burning in a &#8217;round&#8217; for an hour.</p>\n<p>I love the first one.

Gagg, with drawings by Drake Brookshaw. Published by Evans Brothers Limited, London 1953. This edition published in 1963.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Numbers: 246 &#8211; 248 and 302 &#8211; 338</strong></p>\n<p>One day last week I had a day of uninterrupted bliss, in the house on my own. When I say &#8216;day&#8217;, what I mean is &#8216;between school drop-off and pick-up&#8217;, but it was bliss, nevertheless. You take what you can get.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I made these three first birthday postcards.</p>\n<p>As usual, they are made from cereal boxes.</p>\n<p>The blue card around the numbers, literally came from a bin. I actually took it from the bin (and not the &#8216;recycle&#8217; one, either) myself. It was left over from something someone had been making at work, not sure what.</p>\n<p>The blue fabric with the small floral print, from which I cut the numbers, was a dress belonging to my daughter. She&#8217;d be four or five, I guess. I&#8217;m smiling as I look at it. She was so cute in it. I can&#8217;t remember buying it, but the chances are it came from a charity shop, since most of our clothes do.</p>\n<p>Now the book I used. I&#8217;m not certain about this, because the pages were not attached to the cover. When I acquire something now, I document it straight away, or that is my aim. However, when the children were younger, I just threw stuff in a pile, perhaps making a note on a scrap of paper. So although I am 99.9% certain that the postcards are made from the above mentioned book, I&#8217;m not 100% certain (see P.S. below). I found the cover of \u00a0said book with the details attached by paperclip, written buy me in messy haste. The pages certainly look like they once belonged to the cover.</p>\n<p>Plus, the illustrations certainly look like they are the work of the great Percy Drake Brookshaw. Very little is known about Drake Brookshaw, but his style is very recognisable, and I know that he did illustrate a lot of academic children&#8217;s books. He was born in Southwark, London in 1907 (the year our old house in Hither Green was built, I like thinking about that kind of thing), and died in 1993. If you think you don&#8217;t know him, you do. He designed a lot of those iconic posters for London Transport between 1928-1958. He also taught at Goldsmiths&#8217; (my old stomping ground) for quite a while. I found him in the prospectus for 1947/48.

I remembered about them as I was walking to work on Sunday, so I have put what is left in my <a href=\"http://folksy.com/shops/alisonsye\" target=\"_blank\">shop</a>.

She has it set to a radio station that her dad and I look down our noses at. When she came downstairs she had already heard the news.</p>\n<p>&#8220;First Polly, then Fin, then Grace&#8217;s rabbit, and now Nelson Mandela is dead,&#8221; were the first words she said to me this morning.</p>\n<p>Polly was my sister&#8217;s cat. She was 24 actual proper years old. She died exactly a week ago, my sister is devastated.</p>\n<p>Fin was my daughter&#8217;s fish. He had been on his last legs for a couple of weeks. There were once two fish, Fin and Snowy, but Snowy died not long after adoption. They are pictured above, modelled with that DIY dough you make with flour and loads of salt, and bake for about a week. On Sunday, when I arrived at work I checked my emails. One from my daughter, &#8220;fin is dying but his not dead yet&#8221;. When I got home from work, he was gone. She cried and cried, and could she please have a pet that she can actually cuddle and play with?</p>\n<p>Her friend Grace had the cutest rabbit you have ever seen. He was called Bob, and was a house rabbit. I&#8217;m laughing when I say this because I made the mistake of using the term &#8216;house rabbit&#8217; in the presence of my dad, once. I will not make the same mistake again. He has many things in life which he could get angry about, but he picks this. Apparently, there is NO SUCH THING AS A HOUSE RABBIT. On and on and on. Bob died yesterday whilst Grace was at school. He was only about 6 months old, so don&#8217;t know what happened as this story came down the schoolgirl grapevine.</p>\n<p>&#8230;..and now Nelson Mandela is dead. Such a great man, put into the same category as a fish, a rabbit, and a cat. I don&#8217;t think he would mind.</p>\n<p>I was a student in London in the eighties, and was involved in anti-apartheid protests. There was another group of students on the other side wearing disgusting badges. I can&#8217;t even bring myself to type what they said. And now those students are on television, \u00a0showing sympathy. Mr. Manela was a great man, but I am not so great. I cannot forget or forgive.</p>\n<p>Rest in peace, Polly, Fin, Bob and Mr. Mandela, you all did great stuff. Some, more so.</p>\n<p>Have a great weekend,</p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\">Alison x</span></p>\n", "post_id": 1278, "location": false, "date": "12-06-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["charity shop", "Collage", "cereal box", "upcycle", "Embroidery", "Children", "eco", "postcard", "Evans Brothers", "Kingsway English", "1963", "John and Jane", "alisonsye", "J.C.

And buy the cards <a href=\"http://folksy.com/shops/alisonsye\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, if you so wish.</p>\n<p>Those eagle-eyed amongst you may recognise the green fabric as Del&#8217;s shirt, which I used for the mother&#8217;s clothes in my <a href=\"http://alisonsye.wordpress.com/2013/09/16/1-picassos-meal/\" target=\"_blank\">Picasso</a> piece.</p>\n<p>The dark pink fabric is a pillow case I made for my daughter when she was two-ish. I made Reggie, her teddy, one too.</p>\n<p>The pale pink fabric is also used <a href=\"http://alisonsye.wordpress.com/2013/12/13/2-percy-drake-brookshaw-1963-birthday-postcards/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>The red, green and purple card, I quite literally removed from the bin at work. By the way, my daughter was scavenging for titbits in people&#8217;s recycling bins on the way to school this week. What have I done?</p>\n<p>Drake Brookshaw&#8217;s illustrations on this batch are particularly beautiful. Love the party where the children are playing &#8216;Blind Man&#8217;s Bluff&#8217; (313). Well that&#8217;s what we used to call it, anyway. What on earth does it mean? Apart from tripping over the carpet and knocking yourself senseless, because your eyes are covered with Uncle Derek&#8217;s football scarf. On 314 Jane is playing with a doll, whilst John is playing with cars (of course), although it&#8217;s nice to see Jane with a fishing net a bit later on. The snowman illustration (318) is a delight, too. Jane playing in the snow wearing her beautifully tailored coat, and John in his shorts. I like 317, as well, where John discovers he is the wrong way round in the mirror.</p>\n<p>See you on Friday, when I&#8217;ll be having a little giveaway for anyone who has liked my <a href=\"http://facebook.com/alisonsye1\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> Page,</p>\n<p>Alison x</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1306\" style=\"width: 232px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/alisonsye313pc.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1306\" alt=\"313\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/alisonsye313pc.jpg?w=222&#038;h=300\" width=\"222\" height=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">313</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_1307\" style=\"width: 222px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/alisonsye314pc.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1307\" alt=\"314\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/alisonsye314pc.jpg?w=212&#038;h=300\" width=\"212\" height=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">314</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_1308\" style=\"width: 236px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/alisonsye315pc.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1308\" alt=\"315\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/alisonsye315pc.jpg?w=226&#038;h=300\" width=\"226\" height=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">315</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_1309\" style=\"width: 225px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/alisonsye316pc.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1309\" alt=\"316\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/alisonsye316pc.jpg?w=215&#038;h=300\" width=\"215\" height=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">316</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_1310\" style=\"width: 229px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/alisonsye317pc.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1310\" alt=\"317\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/alisonsye317pc.jpg?w=219&#038;h=300\" width=\"219\" height=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">317</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_1311\" style=\"width: 218px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/alisonsye319pc.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1311\" alt=\"319\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/alisonsye319pc.jpg?w=208&#038;h=300\" width=\"208\" height=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">319</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_1312\" style=\"width: 228px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/alisonsye320pc.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1312\" alt=\"320\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/alisonsye320pc.jpg?w=218&#038;h=300\" width=\"218\" height=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">320</p></div>\n", "post_id": 1304, "location": false, "date": "12-18-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Owl", "1967", "Wildsmith", "1969", "birds"], "text": "<p><strong>Numbers: 59, 60, 61 and 62</strong></p>\n<p>In my frenzy to use every part of the book, I made these postcard from the cover.

It takes me away from my making.</p>\n<p>From today until Friday 3rd January I will not be interfering with the internet, except for the odd tweet and blog visit.</p>\n<p>In honour of this, I am giving away a pack of 15 <a href=\"http://alisonsye.wordpress.com/2013/11/1/upcyclist/\" target=\"_blank\">Upcyclist</a> cards.\u00a0I haven&#8217;t sorted them out yet, but one from the image below will be included. It is made from a book which is 122 years old!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://facebook.com/alisonsye1\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> friends will know that a few days ago I bought the above book in a charity shop (I have now become a tad obsessed with Penguin Handbooks). It is very entertaining. I never knew, for example, that you can smoke whilst playing golf but you can&#8217;t move your head, or that there is such a thing as plus-twos.</p>\n<p>Anyway, in order to enter, please answer the highlighted question, which I found in the book. As I know nowt about golf, I&#8217;m not sure whether the answer is commonly known, or whether the author made it up in 1963 and nobody \u00a0has heard of it since.</p>\n<p>Please write your answer below as a comment, and the winner will be the first correct one, in the event of lots of correct ones. I will not comment on your answers until the end of the Giveaway.</p>\n<p>In the event of no correct ones, I will pick the one which I consider to be the most amusing.</p>\n<p>In the event of nobody entering, I will select a name from my Facebook likers.</p>\n<p>Lines will close at High Noon on Thursday 2nd January 2014. I will announce the winner here, and on Twitter (not on Facebook), on Friday 3rd January. If nobody comes forward \u00a0with contact details, I will pick another winner the following Friday.</p>\n<p><strong>To enter, answer the following question:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>According to Bill Cox, what are the 5 deadly sins of golf? (they all end in &#8216;ing&#8217; &#8211; no obscene ones, please)</strong></p>\n<p>Thank you all for your overwhelming support and kindness, I am always amazed when somebody takes the time to comment. May your days be merry and bright, and may 2014 bring you whatever you need.</p>\n<p>Keep on swimming&#8230;.</p>\n<p>Love,</p>\n<p>Alison x</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/100_1219.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1350\" alt=\"100_1219\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/100_1219.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=419\"   /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 1349, "location": false, "date": "12-20-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Father's Day", "greetings card", "Golf", "Improve Your Golf", "socketing", "David Shrigley", "1963", "upcycle", "Penguin Handbook PH94", "Bruce Robertson", "recycle", "cereal box", "Penguin Handbooks", "Penguin", "fluffing", "eco", "slicing", "Bill Cox", "hooking", "Art", "Collage", "alisonsye", "tipping", "original", "Golfing"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/alisonsye1.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1354\" alt=\"alisonsye1\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/alisonsye1.jpg?w=618&#038;h=1024\" width=\"618\" height=\"1024\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Improve Your Golf by Bill Cox.

And by clear-out, I actually mean to throw some stuff away, stuff that normal people would&#8217;ve disposed of years ago.</p>\n<p>I honed in on a large pile of magazines, given to me by a friend and never opened. \u00a0And that was as far as it went. Yes, by the end of the day, nothing had been dumped except the remains of a single, ruthlessly butchered, Vogue. There is something wrong with me&#8230;</p>\n<p>Rewind to\u00a0the last Sunday of 2013. I was on my way to work, when I decided to buy a newspaper to read on the train. Every December, I spend weeks reading, and watching on television, reviews of the year. If I looked hard enough, I could find newspaper reviews going back thirty years, obituaries too. \u00a0I did some large \u00a0pieces to record the events of 1985, 1986 and 1987 (I think), but I sold those at my degree show, and didn&#8217;t have the foresight to take the buyers&#8217; details.</p>\n<p>So, I&#8217;m on the train, and an article (by Gethin Chamberlain, I unsuccessfully tried to add the link) about Katy Perry&#8217;s eyelashes leapt out at me. The conditions of the young women in Indonesia, who skillfully make this stuff, is outrageous. I will save that for another post.</p>\n<p>Back to Vogue. The next few hours were spent cutting false eyelashes from virtually every face in the magazine.</p>\n<p>The next few-ish hours after that were spent cutting out every single letter of the alphabet, and placing them in my twenty-six, carefully arranged, margarine tubs. I am thinking, these letters will come in handy to make some more of those <a href=\"http://alisonsye.wordpress.com/2013/02/04/old-postcard-punkish-love-you-cards/\" target=\"_blank\">Punkish &#8216;Love You&#8217;</a> cards\u00a0(see above, and guess the background anyone?). I am thinking, I could start making those right now. \u00a0Oh, and I really want to do a piece commemorating people who died/die in January, why don&#8217;t I have a bit of a mess around with the names of the recently deceased?&#8230; Hello, it&#8217;s time to pick up my daughter&#8230;</p>\n<p>The new-style Punkish &#8216;Love You&#8217; cards won&#8217;t be finished for a while (you can see my progress below). I need to find some new old postcards, or come up with an alternative method. There are some <a href=\"http://folksy.com/shops/alisonsye\" target=\"_blank\">Jane Eyre</a> hearts \u00a0in my shop at a reduced price, though, if you are interested.</p>\n<p>Other things of note this week:</p>\n<p>1.My blog had its first birthday.</p>\n<p>2.We (husband and I) have finished watching Breaking Bad. We watched the lot in about six weeks, and have been totally consumed by it. Me more so, of course. Can&#8217;t get it out of my system. We have been greeting each other with &#8216;Yo Bitch&#8217; for some time, but I fear it may spill over into conversations with innocent bystanders, if I&#8217;m not careful.</p>\n<p>Have a great weekend, and respect the chemistry,</p>\n<p>Alison x</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/alisonsye.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1374\" alt=\"alisonsye\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/alisonsye.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=856\"   /></a><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/alisonsye2.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1375\" alt=\"alisonsye2\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/alisonsye2.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=768\"   /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 1373, "location": false, "date": "01-10-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Embroidery", "greetings card", "Golf", "Improve Your Golf", "upcycle", "1963", "Penguin Handbook PH94", "Bruce Robertson", "recycle", "Bill Cox", "Penguin Handbooks", "Penguin", "eco", "Love", "charity shop", "Art", "Collage", "Valentine", "alisonsye", "Breaking Bad", "original", "Golfing"], "text": "<div id=\"attachment_1394\" style=\"width: 911px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/alisonsye3401.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1394\" alt=\"340\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/alisonsye3401.jpg?w=901&#038;h=1024\"   /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">340</p></div>\n<p><strong>Improve Your Golf by Bill Cox. Penguin, 1963, First Edition. Penguin Handbook PH94. Cover Design by Bruce Robertson.</strong></p>\n<p>My quest to find some 1970s postcards, so that I can make some more <a href=\"http://alisonsye.wordpress.com/2013/02/04/old-postcard-punkish-love-you-cards/\" target=\"_blank\">Punkish Love You Cards</a>, has failed. \u00a0I am still hopeful.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, back at the Bat-Cave, \u00a0I have made two new cards with the cover from Penguin Handbook 94, \u00a0subject of my recent <a href=\"http://alisonsye.wordpress.com/2014/01/03/the-five-deadly-sins-of-golf-giveaway-winners/\" target=\"_blank\">giveaway</a>. As usual, each card is a one-off. I just couldn&#8217;t resist using that yellow as a background. The book was dropping to bits, not surprising, what with it being fifty years old. Heck, I&#8217;m falling to bits. I have become a bit obsessed with Penguin Handbooks, and with Bruce Robertson covers in particular. I am going to start a <a href=\"http://pinterest.com/alisonsye/\" target=\"_blank\">Pinterest</a> Board.</p>\n<p>You will be able to find them in my <a href=\"http://folksy.com/shops/alisonsye\" target=\"_blank\">Folksy shop</a>\u00a0at some point over the weekend. I am not very happy with the envelopes I have made, my needle was a little blunt, so will list them when Mr. Del Monte (me) has said &#8216;Yes&#8217;.</p>\n<p>Work continues on my Breaking Bad cards. *SPOILER ALERT*</p>\n<p>So far I have two quotes.</p>\n<p>&#8216;Just Basic Chemistry&#8217; which is said twice in the first series. Walt says it to Jesse, and Jesse says it to Badger. I will probably end up with eight of these, all being well.</p>\n<p>Another quote I&#8217;m using is &#8216;Wanna Cook?&#8217;, said to Jesse by Walt. Unfortunately, question marks are difficult to come by.</p>\n<p>The quote I really want to use is, &#8216;There&#8217;s more than just chemistry here&#8217;. Walt says this to Gretchen in a flashback. I think it contains too many letters, but intend to try anyway. I have gone completely against the grain, and ordered some 1970s New Mexico postcards on Ebay. Impulse buy. They haven&#8217;t arrived yet, but I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing how well they sew.</p>\n<p>Have a great weekend,</p>\n<p>Alison</p>\n<p>PS. As you can see, I did not get a new camera for Christmas. Believe it or not it took me three hours to take these photos., which are the best of a very bad bunch!</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1395\" style=\"width: 307px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/alisonsye340b1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1395\" alt=\"340\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/alisonsye340b1.jpg?w=297&#038;h=300\" width=\"297\" height=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">340</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_1396\" style=\"width: 275px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/alisonsye339.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1396\" alt=\"339\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/alisonsye339.jpg?w=265&#038;h=300\" width=\"265\" height=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">339</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_1397\" style=\"width: 270px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/alisonsye339b.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1397\" alt=\"339\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/alisonsye339b.jpg?w=260&#038;h=300\" width=\"260\" height=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">339</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_1390\" style=\"width: 243px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/alisonsye1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1390\" alt=\"Just Basic Chemistry\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/alisonsye1.jpg?w=233&#038;h=300\" width=\"233\" height=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Just Basic Chemistry</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_1391\" style=\"width: 231px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/alisonsye21.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1391\" alt=\"Wanna Cook?\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/alisonsye21.jpg?w=221&#038;h=300\" width=\"221\" height=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Wanna Cook?</p></div>\n<p><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/alisonsye1.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1354\" alt=\"alisonsye1\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/alisonsye1.jpg?w=181&#038;h=300\" width=\"181\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 1386, "location": false, "date": "01-17-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Vintage", "1960s", "Love You", "upcycle", "1940", "recycle", "beach", "eco", "Punk", "Punkish Love You Cards", "boats", "Newquay", "Art", "Vogue", "Love", "postcard", "seaside", "Anglesey", "Valentine", "Collage", "alisonsye", "Ordnance Survey", "Children", "original"], "text": "<div id=\"attachment_1404\" style=\"width: 897px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/alisonsye341.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1404\" alt=\"341\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/alisonsye341.jpg?w=887&#038;h=1024\"   /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">341</p></div>\n<p><strong>Newquay PT867.

very welcome guests in our home. They entertained us every evening. They were great company. But now they have gone, they are still here.</p>\n<p>I am attempting an exorcism by making some Breaking Bad Valentine&#8217;s (or whatever) cards.</p>\n<p>I wanted to make some in the style of my <a href=\"http://alisonsye.wordpress.com/2013/02/04/old-postcard-punkish-love-you-cards/\" target=\"_blank\">Punkish</a> ones, as they seem to &#8216;fit&#8217;. If you have seen them, you will know they are made from vintage British \u00a0postcards. I obviously needed the American equivalent, for this new version.</p>\n<p>In an excited frenzy, I did the unthinkable. I turned to Ebay. Nothing wrong with that, I hear you say. And indeed, there isn&#8217;t. But it goes completely against the grain, for me. It is absolutely not what I do. I use stuff up, I don&#8217;t acquire more stuff and ship it half way across the world. So this purchase, of a 1970s Albuquerque postcard book, was doomed from the start. Plus, it was expensive. Not to mention the hours I spent searching, in the first place.</p>\n<p>And so, I started cutting out letters and assembling quotes, &#8216;Wanna Cook?&#8217;, &#8216;Just Basic Chemistry&#8217;, &#8216;Buy the Rv, we start tomorrow&#8217; and so on. All the time, I&#8217;m thinking that these letters will be too big for the postcards.</p>\n<p>My package arrived yesterday, beautifully wrapped and in a lovely envelope covered in stamps. I will use this envelope. The postcard book is in immaculate condition, still in the cellophane, and certainly 1970s. The thirteen postcards I was expecting turned out to be six, as they are double-sided, and the card is quite thin.</p>\n<p>Of course, now that I have it I must use it. Otherwise that carbon footprint will be for nothing.</p>\n<p>I was up very late last night cutting out my quotes, only to discover the obvious, they are too big. I stayed up even later cutting out smaller letters. This morning I was woken at five by a car alarm, so here I am. The children are having their breakfast now, at the same table which thirty minutes ago was covered in quotes.</p>\n<p>Alison x</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/alisonsye36.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1426\" alt=\"alisonsye36\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/alisonsye36.jpg?w=580&#038;h=1024\" width=\"580\" height=\"1024\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/alisonse35.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1427\" alt=\"alisonse35\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/alisonse35.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=649\"   /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 1424, "location": false, "date": "01-22-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Valentine Cards", "Vintage", "Vintage Postcard", "New Mexico", "Embroidery", "greetings card", "upcycle", "Albuquerque", "recycle", "eco", "Ebay", "Love", "Art", "postcard", "Valentine", "Collage", "Valentine Card", "alisonsye", "Breaking Bad", "Jesse Pinkmam", "Walter White", "original"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/alisonsye8.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1434\" alt=\"alisonsye8\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/alisonsye8.jpg?w=763&#038;h=1024\"   /></a></p>\n<p>If you have been following the making of these cards, you will notice that the above quotes are now mounted onto yellow \u00a0instead of red.

It was published by<strong> Petley Studios\u00a0</strong><strong>Inc., \u00a0</strong><strong style=\"line-height:1.5em;\">Albuquerque, C1975</strong><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\">. I searched Ebay for hours, before finally ordering, and then immediately regretted it. You see, I do not go looking for stuff, stuff finds me. These postcards came all the way from America, an unnecessary addition to my carbon footprint, and were pretty expensive. When they arrived, the card wasn&#8217;t as thick as I had hoped. And instead of the thirteen postcards advertised, there were actually only seven, \u00a0printed back-to-back. On the plus side, the condition was excellent, it was still in the cellophane wrapper, and it was very 1970s. It was packaged beautifully, with a lovely thick white envelope covered in apple stamps, which I used to make the eighth card.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\">&#8216;Just Basic Chemistry\u2019 \u00a0is said twice in the first series.

Walt says it to Jesse, and Jesse says it to Badger.</p>\n<p>They are mounted onto recycled card, not my usual style of used food packaging. I have made cards for as long as I can remember, but only started selling them when my son was born, thirteen years ago. Although I have always used cereal boxes, and the like, to make cards for my friends and family, in the early days I didn&#8217;t think anyone else would buy them. So I bought a thousand (yes!) pieces of ready-cut recycled card. This card now sits under my sink. When the quotes I had mounted turned out to be too big for my usual card, \u00a0I decided to try and use the under-sink card. It works, I think.</p>\n<p>As you can see, I have sailed a bit close to the wind on 413, so won&#8217;t be putting this in my shop. It&#8217;s such a bummer when this happens. Hours of work had already gone into this card and then I mess it up at the very end, and there is nothing to be done. Not like sewing with fabric, where (although very annoying) it can be unpicked and sewn again. When you are sewing with paper and card, if you make a mistake it can&#8217;t be redone because the needle holes are still there.</p>\n<p>I now have thirteen Breaking Bad cards left to record, then I will put them in my <a href=\"http://folksy.com/shops/alisonsye\" target=\"_blank\">shop</a>,</p>\n<p>More coming soon,</p>\n<p>Alison x</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1514\" style=\"width: 225px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/alisonsye408.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1514\" alt=\"408\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/alisonsye408.jpg?w=215&#038;h=300\" width=\"215\" height=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">408</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_1515\" style=\"width: 223px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/alisonsye409.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1515\" alt=\"409\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/alisonsye409.jpg?w=213&#038;h=300\" width=\"213\" height=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">409</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_1516\" style=\"width: 224px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/alisonsye410.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1516\" alt=\"410\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/alisonsye410.jpg?w=214&#038;h=300\" width=\"214\" height=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">410</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_1517\" style=\"width: 224px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/alisonsye411.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1517\" alt=\"411\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/alisonsye411.jpg?w=214&#038;h=300\" width=\"214\" height=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">411</p>\n<div class=\"mceTemp mceIEcenter\">\n<dl class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_1518\" style=\"width:221px;\">\n<dt class=\"wp-caption-dt\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/alisonsye412.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1518\" alt=\"412\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/alisonsye412.jpg?w=211&#038;h=300\" width=\"211\" height=\"300\" /></a></dt>\n<dd class=\"wp-caption-dd\">412</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_1519\" style=\"width: 227px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/alisonsye413.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1519\" alt=\"413\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/alisonsye413.jpg?w=217&#038;h=300\" width=\"217\" height=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">413</p></div>\n<p><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/alisonsye8.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1434\" alt=\"alisonsye8\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/alisonsye8.jpg?w=223&#038;h=300\" width=\"223\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n</div>\n", "post_id": 1512, "location": false, "date": "01-28-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Collage", "upcycle", "Breaking Bad", "eco", "Valentine Cards", "Albuquerque", "Valentine", "Art", "Valentine Card", "alisonsye", "New Mexico", "Embroidery", "recycle", "greetings card", "Love", "Walter White", "Jesse Pinkman", "original"], "text": "<div id=\"attachment_1525\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/alisonsye416.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1525\" alt=\"416\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/alisonsye416.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=930\"   /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">416</p></div>\n<p><strong>Numbers 414, 415 and 416</strong></p>\n<p>This is pretty much the same as the last post, just with three different cards, all unique.</p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\">\u2018Just Basic Chemistry\u2019 is said twice in the first series.

I have made cards for as long as I can remember, but only started selling them when my son was born, thirteen years ago. Although I have always used cereal boxes to make cards for my friends and family, in the early days I didn\u2019t think anyone else would buy them. So I bought a thousand (yes!) pieces of ready-cut recycled card. This card now sits under my sink. When the quotes I had mounted turned out to be too big for my usual card, \u00a0I decided to try \u00a0the under-sink card. It works, I think.

Everything was destined for the bin, so super eco-friendly, and as usual each one is totally unique.</p>\n<p>&#8216;Wanna Cook?&#8217; is a quote from the first series. Walt says it to Jesse. I spent ages looking for those question marks.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t know how much you know about the Brontes, but I sometimes give a talk about the painting, in the gallery where I work. You know, that famous-ish one, their brother painted? Truth is, I don&#8217;t talk about the painting much, it&#8217;s not very good. I talk about their grandfather and father.</p>\n<p>The grandfather lived in Ireland and was a renowned storyteller. This was in days when not many people could read. Folks would come from miles around, just to sit around the fire listening to his stories. They would hold onto his every word, and not want to leave.</p>\n<p>This is how I feel about Breaking Bad. We may be living in modern times, but there is not much difference. I would look forward to the storyteller visiting us each evening and telling \u00a0one hell of a yarn. I did not want each installment to end. I was consumed by it. I have not felt this way since reading The Life Of Pi. It is not the same, by the way, if you know what happens. You must be innocently led to the slaughter, lamb-style.</p>\n<p>My husband, who made a brief appearance on my <a href=\"http://facebook.com/alisonsye1/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook Page</a> today (and got more likes and comments than I ever get &#8211; although, \u00a0someone unliked me &#8211; no doubt an Everton fan), tells me I should not compare everything to The Life of Pi (book, not film). Breaking Bad is my benchmark now, although some episodes weren&#8217;t as top notch as others.</p>\n<p>So here are the final six,</p>\n<p>Alison x</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1535\" style=\"width: 293px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/alisonsye418.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1535\" alt=\"418\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/alisonsye418.jpg?w=283&#038;h=300\" width=\"283\" height=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">418</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_1536\" style=\"width: 305px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/alisonsye419.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1536\" alt=\"419\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/alisonsye419.jpg?w=295&#038;h=300\" width=\"295\" height=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">419</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_1537\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/alisonsye420.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1537\" alt=\"420\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/alisonsye420.jpg?w=300&#038;h=298\" width=\"300\" height=\"298\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">420</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_1538\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/alisonsye421.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1538\" alt=\"421\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/alisonsye421.jpg?w=300&#038;h=292\" width=\"300\" height=\"292\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">421</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_1539\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/alisonsye422.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1539\" alt=\"422\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/alisonsye422.jpg?w=300&#038;h=270\" width=\"300\" height=\"270\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">422</p></div>\n", "post_id": 1533, "location": false, "date": "01-29-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Valentine Card", "Love", "Sevenoaks", "Valentine Cards", "Lyme Regis", "Charing Cross Station", "Punkish Love You Cards", "Bournemouth", "Love You", "Walmer", "London", "Whitstable", "Weymouth", "Folkstone", "Wick", "Valentine"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/alisonsye1011.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1544\" alt=\"alisonsye101\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/alisonsye1011.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=540\"   /></a></p>\n<p>Happy Friday.</p>\n<p>Just a quick post to give you a brief glimpse of some new cards.</p>\n<p>They are all made from vintage postcards, some of which still have writing on the back.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m dashing off to make some envelopes.

J. Salmon Limited, Sevenoaks.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Number 351</strong></p>\n<p>I love this card. The young boy pushing the boat out and his friend watching on the bank, at the end of the sixties, when they start selling hippy wigs in Woolworth&#8217;s. Oh, and Jesus sandals with socks, very 1969.</p>\n<p>At one point (9th \u00a0September, 1969) in the life of this postcard, \u00a0Marjorie sat down in Milford-on-Sea and wrote the following to Mrs E. Parks in Solihull:</p>\n<p><em>Thank you so much for your letter. I hope the lovely monsters arrived home safely. I&#8217;m having a very happy and relaxing time, only wish it was longer. The weather has been, and still is, lovely &#8211; almost too hot at times.\u00a0<span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\">Much love, Marjorie.</span></em></p>\n<p>Can&#8217;t help but wonder what those lovely monsters are doing now.</p>\n<p>Forty-five years later, I gave the postcard another life. I cut out some letters from old magazines and mounted the words &#8216;Love You&#8217; onto an exhibition advert&#8217; from work. I work in a London gallery, and when an exhibition comes to an end any leftover paraphernalia is put into the recycling bin. Unless I get to it first. If you look carefully beneath the letters, you will see a leaflet for an exhibition about Elizabeth 1. Queen Bess moved over a few weeks ago to make way for David Bailey.</p>\n<p>The envelope is made from a 1940 Ordnance Survey map of Anglesey. Actually, it&#8217;s more of a wallet than an envelope. I wouldn&#8217;t recommend putting it in the post, what with it being 74 years old. The card and envelope have a combined age of 139 years! As usual, I have made no attempt to erase the blemishes left by life.</p>\n<p>Hopefully, it will be in my <a href=\"http://folksy.com/shops/alisonsye/\" target=\"_blank\">shop</a> soon.</p>\n<p>Have a great weekend,</p>\n<p>Alison x</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/dsc_0319.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1551\" alt=\"DSC_0319\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/dsc_0319.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=768\"   /><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/alisonsye351b.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1552\" alt=\"alisonsye351b\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/alisonsye351b.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=658\"   /></a><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/alisonsye351pb.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1553\" alt=\"alisonsye351pb\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/alisonsye351pb.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=642\"   /></a><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/alisonsye351e.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1554\" alt=\"alisonsye351e\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/alisonsye351e.jpg?w=773&#038;h=1024\"   /></a><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/alisonsye351eb.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1555\" alt=\"alisonsye351eb\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/alisonsye351eb.jpg?w=806&#038;h=1024\"   /></a></a></p>\n", "post_id": 1549, "location": false, "date": "01-31-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Collage", "1984", "seaside", "Love", "eco", "postcard", "E.Nagele", "Valentine Card", "Valentine", "John Hinde Studios", "Valentine Cards", "Lyme Regis", "upcycle", "Embroidery", "recycle", "greetings card", "Art", "Dorset", "beach", "original"], "text": "<div id=\"attachment_1565\" style=\"width: 778px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/alisonsye348.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1565\" alt=\"348\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/alisonsye348.jpg?w=768&#038;h=1024\"   /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">348</p></div>\n<p><strong>John Hinde Original. 3BM83. 9 Rupert Street, London W1.

Today we have been languishing nicely in the heat on the quieter end of Lyme beach. Returning Sunday if it stays fine.

E2J.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Number: 349</strong></p>\n<p>My family love Bournemouth, we have had some good times there. The little boy, with his head down in the foreground, reminds me of my son.</p>\n<p>In 1973 Bertha and George sent this postcard to Mrs F. Reavley. The address on the card is not far from where my parents live, and indeed where I grew up. We used to have a lovely shop in our town, called &#8216;Reavley&#8217;s&#8217;, selling toys and stuff, can&#8217;t help but wonder if there is a connection. This is what Bertha and George wrote:</p>\n<p><em>Dovedale Hotel, Bournemouth. Dear G C F, we are spending a holiday here. This is our second week. The weather was lovely last week, not so good this week, but we are enjoying the break. Have been to Salisbury today. Hope you&#8217;re both ok. Bertha and George.</em></p>\n<p>People from foreign climes laugh at our weather obsession, they can&#8217;t understand it. The thing is our weather is so damn temperamental, that of course it is a constant talking point. It is the main topic of conversation on a postcard, because it can make or break a holiday in the UK. The person you are sending it to needs to know that it wasn&#8217;t raining solidly for a fortnight. There are a huge amount of people suffering from seven weeks worth of flooding, as I write. My heart goes out to them.</p>\n<p>Forty years later the postcard found its way to me. I have given it a new life. I hope Bertha and George would approve. The letters have been cut from old magazines and leaflets and then sewn onto the card.</p>\n<p>The envelope is made from a 1940 Ordnance Survey map of Anglesey. Actually, it\u2019s more of a wallet than an envelope. I wouldn\u2019t recommend putting it in the post, what with it being 74 years old. The card and envelope have a combined age of 110 years! As usual, I have made no attempt to erase the blemishes left by life.</p>\n<p>The card is totally unique and super eco-friendly.</p>\n<p>Hopefully, it will be in my\u00a0<a href=\"http://folksy.com/shops/alisonsye/\" target=\"_blank\">shop</a>\u00a0soon.</p>\n<p>Have a great week,</p>\n<p>Alison x</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/alisonsye349i.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1580\" alt=\"alisonsye349i\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/alisonsye349i.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=782\"   /><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/alisonsye349b.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1581\" alt=\"alisonsye349b\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/alisonsye349b.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=647\"   /></a><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/alisonsye349pb.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1582\" alt=\"alisonsye349pb\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/alisonsye349pb.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=652\"   /></a><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/alisonsye349e.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1583\" alt=\"alisonsye349e\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/alisonsye349e.jpg?w=810&#038;h=1024\"   /></a><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/alisonsye349eb.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1584\" alt=\"alisonsye349eb\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/alisonsye349eb.jpg?w=819&#038;h=1024\"   /></a></a></p>\n", "post_id": 1576, "location": false, "date": "02-03-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Mothers' Day", "Valentine Cards", "Father's Day", "Charing Cross Station", "E.

When I look at the deck-chair couple, I smile.</p>\n<p>The picture shows The Battery Gardens, Sandown, Isle of White. Showing the bay with Culver cliffs.</p>\n<p>I have never been to The Isle of White, but when I think of it, two people come to mind. Billy Connolly and Aine&#8217;s John.</p>\n<p>Billy Connolly was in that film where he had a thing for Queen Victoria (aka Dame Judy,) with Isle of White connections. Mr. Brown. He was good in it. We saw him in the street once, on Skye.</p>\n<p>My friend Aine has travelled the world with her husband, John. Wherever they go, it is never as good as The Isle of White, according to John.</p>\n<p>Anyway, the postcard was posted to Sue in Southend in 1968, by Linda and Janet. This is what they said:</p>\n<p><em>Dear Sue, The weather here in Sandown is rather chilly </em>(?)<em> but went on the beach yesterday. Today we went to Carisbrooke Castle and saw the donkey at the well house. Yesterday we took a bus to Shanklin and walked back along the cliff. My poor feet. Love, Linda and Janet.</em></p>\n<p>Forty-five years later, the postcard found its way to me. I have added the words &#8216;Love You&#8217;, which were cut from old magazines and leaflets.</p>\n<p>As usual, it is totally unique and super eco-friendly.</p>\n<p>I have used a 1941 Ordnance Survey map of Hexham for the envelope. Someone, has violated it with a pink marker pen. The envelope is more like a wallet, though, as I have no intention of making it seal with glue or stickers. It\u2019s 73 years old. No stickers.</p>\n<p>The envelope and card have a combined age of 118 years!</p>\n<p>It is a recent addition to my <a href=\"http://folksy.com/shops/alisonsye/\" target=\"_blank\">shop</a>.</p>\n<p>Have a great weekend,</p>\n<p>Alison x</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/alisonsye378i.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1641\" alt=\"alisonsye378i\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/alisonsye378i.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=744\"   /><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/alisonsye378b.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1642\" alt=\"alisonsye378b\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/alisonsye378b.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=642\"   /></a><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/alisonsye378p.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1643\" alt=\"alisonsye378p\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/alisonsye378p.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=642\"   /></a><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/alisonsye378e.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1644\" alt=\"alisonsye378e\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/alisonsye378e.jpg?w=865&#038;h=1024\"   /></a><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/alisonsye378eb.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1645\" alt=\"alisonsye378eb\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/alisonsye378eb.jpg?w=851&#038;h=1024\"   /></a><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/alisonsye378pb.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1646\" alt=\"alisonsye378pb\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/alisonsye378pb.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=613\"   /></a></a></p>\n", "post_id": 1638, "location": false, "date": "02-07-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["1967", "Wildsmith", "1969", "birds"], "text": "<p>Gone through seven scalpel blades scoring and cutting this card.

The last time I saw her she produced a cheese grater, remembering that I have been using a broken one for years. Sally is the kindest person ever, when she visits it is like Christmas. Her children are older than mine so we have had years of wonderful cast-offs.</span></p>\n<p>So one day Sally turns up with a treasured pile of Animal Actions, once owned by her two daughters, and before this, her niece. They were an immediate hit, and this was observed by Grandpa. Birthday present problem solved.</p>\n<p>When the magazine drops on the mat, excitement fills the air. My daughter always enters the competitions and sends in artwork, once proudly having a picture of a horse published.</p>\n<p>A few days ago a parcel arrived. I thought it must be from my mam, she is always sending parcels to the children. She lives three hundred miles away. Later, my daughter opened the package to find out that she had won a prize, a board game called Mask &#8216;n&#8217; Ask. She was more than happy.</p>\n<p>The best thing is this, however, she wrote a letter to thank Georgia (the Animal Action lady) and tell her how much she liked the prize. Totally unprompted. She does waffle on a bit, telling Georgia about Sally&#8217;s girls, and her giraffe exhibition (if you follow me on <a href=\"http://facebook.com/alisonsye1/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> you will know about this), but it is pretty endearing.</p>\n<p>If you have children, you will know that they never cease to amaze you. Sometimes in a good way, and sometimes in a bad way. I regularly feel that I am not a very good parent, but when she showed me this letter I felt that maybe we have done something right.</p>\n<p>Have a great weekend,</p>\n<p>Alison x</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/alisonsye15.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1688\" alt=\"alisonsye15\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/alisonsye15.jpg?w=698&#038;h=1024\"   /><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/alisonsye141.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1698\" alt=\"alisonsye14\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/alisonsye141.jpg?w=1019&#038;h=1024\"   /></a></a></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1692\" style=\"width: 954px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/alisonsye11.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1692\" alt=\"The 'Giraffe Exhibition' which has been happening in our house for about six weeks!\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/alisonsye11.jpg?w=944&#038;h=1024\"   /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The &#8216;Giraffe Exhibition&#8217; which has been happening in our house for about six weeks!</p></div>\n<p><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/alisonsye2.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1693\" alt=\"alisonsye2\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/alisonsye2.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=680\"   /></a></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1685\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/1alisonsye.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1685\" alt=\"The prize.\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/1alisonsye.jpg?w=300&#038;h=278\" width=\"300\" height=\"278\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The prize.</p></div>\n<p><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/alisonsye13.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1686\" alt=\"alisonsye13\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/alisonsye13.jpg?w=199&#038;h=300\" width=\"199\" height=\"300\" /></a><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/alisonsye16.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1687\" alt=\"alisonsye16\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/alisonsye16.jpg?w=300&#038;h=229\" width=\"300\" height=\"229\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 1683, "location": false, "date": "02-21-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Vintage", "Children's Literature", "Blackberry Farm", "Brixton", "1980s", "greetings card", "Mr and Mrs Smiles", "1949", "upcycle", "Illustration", "recycle", "cereal box", "Emily The Goat", "eco", "F.

She can&#8217;t remember any details. What she can remember, however, is me cutting a huge hole from the middle of it when I was about 17 (1984 &#8211; my Dad was on strike at the time, I&#8217;m using this as an excuse) to make myself a scarf-cum-bandanna\u00a0to tie around my head. There was no print in the middle of the tablecloth, \u00a0just plain red &#8211; I was going for a kind of New Romantic look. After 1984 it was never used again, obviously. Mam was furious.</p>\n<p>When I opened the gift I couldn&#8217;t believe it, because annoyingly Mam never keeps anything. She found it in my cupboard at home and\u00a0thought\u00a0it would give me a laugh. There it was, complete with hole and gravy stain (she makes the BEST gravy) on one of the candles.</p>\n<p>I have thought about using it a number of times since, but nothing came to mind, and then it became lost on Fabric Mountain.

He was telling me that a load of people I know are on their way down to Wembley to watch Sunderland play (football), and it reminded me of another football related story he told me years ago. It was about his first visit to London, again to watch a match at Wembley, when he saw Buckingham Palace for the first time and stood gazing through the gaps between the big black railings. He pointed out to me the exact spot at which he stood. It must&#8217;ve been such a shock. This was a boy who never wore shoes. Even within a very poor pit village, they were the poor family. The &#8216;dirty&#8217; family. When his first visit to London came around, he was seventeen, and had already been working down the pit for two years.

W.H. Smith, 1986.</strong></p>\n<p>I am annoyed.</p>\n<p>Years of teaching in a primary school has given me a decent knowledge of children&#8217;s literature, but I know nothing about Celia Berridge, the illustrator of the above card.</p>\n<p>So, I searched the internet. Nothing, or very little information about her life. Plenty of books she has written and illustrated, but not much about her as a person. How many times have I trawled the internet trying to find information about a woman illustrator and found zilch? Many times. The emphasis is on the &#8216;woman&#8217; illustrator, if you didn&#8217;t pick that up. Don&#8217;t get me started.</p>\n<p>Eventually I found some details on a 1976 dust jacket. At the time she was living in Greenwich, London, with her husband and two children. She had been a teacher and taught in primary schools in Deptford and Bermondsey.</p>\n<p>John Cuncliffe, however, could be my specialist subject on Mastermind. I have been a big fan of his for many years. My job here, though, is to give the illustrator credit. So please accept my apologies, Celia.</p>\n<p>As to the history of this particular book&#8230;no idea where I acquired it.</p>\n<p>If you have been following my March Sale stuff, you will know the rest\u2026</p>\n<p>This month I am making a determined attempt to get some of the \u2018old stock\u2019 from under my bed, and into the sale section of my\u00a0<a href=\"http://folksy.com/shops/alisonsye/\" target=\"_blank\">shop</a>.

&#8216;tat&#8217; that some people donate. She was saying, to the assistant, that nobody in their right mind would want to buy the stuff in the bag she was holding. That may indeed have been true. I bought the stuff.</p>\n<p>One of the items was this badly torn annual, the same vintage as myself. Turns out, after spending five hours internetting last night, this particular annual is quite rare. If it had been in good condition, it would&#8217;ve been worth some money. I have no idea where the book is now of course, somewhere in the attic I expect. In a safe place. I made a few cards from it in 2012, three of which I recently found under the bed.</p>\n<p>All three cards are made from a story written by Leslie Charteris entitled &#8216;The Silver Chute&#8217;, starring Simon Templar as &#8216;The Saint&#8217;. Suave Templar is enjoying the high life of Las Vegas, when he stumbles across a dead body in a casino. The man has been poisoned! The Saint fights off various attempts on his life, charms a mystery lady known as The Countess, and uncovers a large heist of stolen goods. All in a day&#8217;s work&#8230;</p>\n<p>This particular card shows a street scene, with flashy car and cacti!</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I cannot give the illustrator credit.

He was a war artist and a lot of his work is now housed in The Imperial War Museum.</p>\n<p>After the war he painted portraits.

He introduced me to many great characters, one of which was Adrian Mole. We went to a rough-as-you-like comprehensive, in one of the most deprived areas of the country. There was a lot of glue- sniffing in my school. There were also a lot of extremely bright, overlooked kids. Our David was one of them. He is the son of a factory worker (my dad&#8217;s younger brother, who escaped the pit), and now works in a betting shop in our home town.</p>\n<p>Over the years, meeting students, teachers, professors, professional people, I have often had the same thought. They are not nearly so bright as the kids I went to school with.</p>\n<p>I came to London at nineteen to go to art college. It was the Eighties. It was Goldmiths&#8217;. I didn&#8217;t know about snobbery. Hard to believe, but I didn&#8217;t.</p>\n<p>On the first day, we sat in a circle and discussed our favourite books. Mine, Adrian Mole. There were sniggers. I was crushed, and didn&#8217;t really talk again for the rest of the course. I became almost reclusive. It seemed everyone else knew what to say, and how to say it.</p>\n<p>I knew I was different as I watched my fellow students arrive in their parents&#8217; cars, loaded up with useful stuff, like pans and towels. I arrived on my own, on the National Express coach from Durham \u00a0to Victoria, with one bag on my back. I got the 36 \u00a0from Victoria, when I actually said the words &#8220;You can have my seat missus&#8221;. Also, \u00a0I shouted a &#8216;thank you&#8217; to the driver as I got off the bus.

The book was published in the 1960s, and was inscribed &#8216;Karen Mitchell&#8217;.</p>\n<p>7. The Big Book of Saints, retold by Christine Chaundler. Published by A.R. Mowray and Co. Limited. First published in 1952, this edition in 1964. When I was a student, I had a Saturday Job working at Mowbray&#8217;s Bookshop. It was near Broadcasting House. I was lucky enough to be living near London Bridge at the time, so I used to walk there. After I left, the company was taken over by Dillon&#8217;s Books. Then Dillon&#8217;s disappeared, too. I went looking for the building recently, and found its latest incarnation\u00a0to be a bra shop. That&#8217;s a picture of Saint Vincent (left), by the way. The one on the right is a child from the story. Saint Vincent, as well as other stuff, was sold as a slave and started children&#8217;s homes.</p>\n<p>8. This square was taken from a \u00a0leaflet cataloging the wedding presents given to &#8216;Her Royal Highness The Princess Anne and Captain Mark Phillips&#8217;, on 14th November, 1973. It was published to accompany a display of said presents at St. James&#8217;s Palace. I bought it for the bargain price of 50p from a local charity shop, and it kept me entertained for ages. Everything was listed and displayed, no matter how ridiculous. Anonymous gave &#8216;toilet preparations&#8217; (what?), Mrs F. Jenkins gave two pairs of nylon stockings, Mrs M.E. Coe gave picture postcards of San Diego, Mrs N. Cleary gave talcum powder, The Aga Khan gave a Telex cassette player, Mr and Mrs A.\u00a0Hicks gave a milking stool. I could go on, as every single present is a gem, but there are 1,524 listings.</p>\n<p>It has taken me over three hours to find the relevant notes for just three points, and, as I have hungry children to feed, I need to stop there.</p>\n<p>I will try to record some more early next week,</p>\n<p>Enjoy the weekend,</p>\n<p>Alison x</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "post_id": 1870, "location": false, "date": "05-02-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Anderson Shelter", "February 1939", "Vintage", "National Geographic 1939", "Hillsborough Disaster", "Embroidery", "upcycle", "1940", "Bismark", "recycle", "London", "eco", "Dhaka Factory Collapse", "charity shop", "Ordnance Survey Sheet 99", "Art", "Pembroke and Tenby", "Nelson's Column", "patchwork", "Collage", "alisonsye", "Ordnance Survey", "original"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/alisonsye.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1871\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/alisonsye.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=900\" alt=\"alisonsye\"   /></a><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/alisonsye1.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1872\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/alisonsye1.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=732\" alt=\"alisonsye1\"   /></a></p>\n<p>I have forty-five minutes to record some more of my map.

It would&#8217;ve been his birthday this week. He never said the word &#8216;butter&#8217; without putting the word &#8216;best&#8217; in front of it. Mostly he ate margarine on his bread, except on special occasions when he had &#8216;best butter&#8217;.

I intended to sew a new word each day, onto an old linen napkin, I had been saving for this purpose.</p>\n<p>So, the ninth of May arrived, not one stitch. However, I had made notes, so vowed to keep it up for the whole month. And I did. At the end of the month I had thirty-one words waiting to be sewn.</p>\n<p>Instead of doing that, though, I started on June&#8217;s words. I am actually keeping this up-to-date, you can see it <a href=\"http://alisonsye.wordpress.com/2014/06/10/3-june-2014/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. I am on a roll and enjoying myself. There are little letters all over the house. I am on such a roll that I can&#8217;t stop, so I have started sewing May&#8217;s words.</p>\n<p>This is what I have so far.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Bald</span></strong> 1st May</p>\n<p>A little nod to Bob Hoskins who died last month.

I never use it, and cringe when others use do. I could perhaps stomach it&#8217;s use to describe a person&#8217;s morals, say, but not for so-called facial imperfections. Danny Kaye is one of my favourite actors, but when I hear him sing The Ugly Duckling song, I get vexed. I mean, the other birds chased the duckling right out of town, just because his feathers were stubby and brown! However, I use it here as a tribute to Eli Wallach, who died a few days ago.</p>\n<p>Eli Wallach was born in Brooklyn in 1915, the son of Polish immigrants. I saw him being interviewed at the NFT a few years back. After the interview he introduced a showing of The Good, The Bad and The Ugly (in my top ten favourite films), hence the word, and he sat in the front row and watched the film with us. He was a lovely, gentle man, not ugly at all. Not Tuco at all. He said that Sergio Leone told him he wanted the whole movie to look like a Vermeer painting. How great is that?</p>\n<p>Oddly enough, what with Frank also featuring on this napkin, Wallach was the original choice for the Sinatra role in From Here To Eternity. Also, although I don&#8217;t really want to mention Godfather 3, Sinatra was offered Wallach&#8217;s part, but turned it down.</p>\n<p>If you have not been following my napkin work, and have no idea what I am talking about, then read on (if you have been following, then I am about to repeat myself) and I will explain.

He never talked about it much, but we all knew how horrible it was. Some things are obvious, working deep underground in cramped, wet conditions, knee-deep in water all day.

The idea, at first, was to sew a word onto an old napkin for each day of the month. A word with some relevance for that particular day. However, as usual, I didn\u2019t stick to my own brief. \u2018One word\u2019 soon became \u2018a few words\u2019, or sometimes a picture. The aim is to end up with a memento of the month. If you look at the cloud to the right, or at the end of the post, and click on the \u2018napkin\u2019 heading, you will be able to view notes about the other words.</p>\n<p>See you Friday,</p>\n<p>Alison x</p>\n<p>P.S. We are having building work done in August, due to finding loads of rotten floorboards (a twenty year leak we knew nothing about when we moved here, a few years ago) and asbestos.

This seemed to fit the bill, with it being exactly a hundred years since \u00a0Gavrilo Princip (pictured, bottom right) assassinated Franz Ferdinand. It is a flyer, pulled from the bin, of an exhibition about The Great War at The National Portrait Gallery. I have sewn every face from the leaflet onto the napkin, and I will tell you who they are in a moment.</p>\n<p>First, I just want to remind you that my <a href=\"http://folksy.com/shops/alisonsye/\" target=\"_blank\">shop</a> will be closing in a few days. I will reopen on 1st September. Most things (not the computer, yet) are now boxed away, ready for the building work to begin. I think it best that I cancel the August Giveaway on my <a href=\"http://facebook.com/alisonsye1/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook Page</a>, too. I will be running my operation from my &#8216;phone, and if you know me you will already be laughing.</p>\n<p>My intention is to blog every Tuesday and Friday during August, although it may just be Friday. I want to record the making of my <a href=\"http://alisonsye.wordpress.com/2014/06/16/2-may-2014/\" target=\"_blank\">May</a> napkin, which is coming along nicely. I like it better than the June one. Not sure if this is because all of the information was recorded before I started sewing.</p>\n<p>By the way, I joined Instagram last week, if any of you are interested. I have no idea how to add the link to that, but it&#8217;s just my name if you&#8217;re searching. I&#8217;m on Pinterest, as well. I generally follow back.</p>\n<p>Anyway, back to my June napkin.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2111\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/alisonsye41.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-2111\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/alisonsye41.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=719\" alt=\"Baron Von Richthofen, Field Marshal Von Hindenburg by August Bocher, 1917 (copyright IWM), William Orpen (IWM), Jack Travers Cornwell (IWM), A Grenadier Guardsman by William Orpen, 1917 (IWM)\"   /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Baron Von Richthofen: Field Marshal Von Hindenburg by August Bocher, 1917 (copyright, Imperial War Museum): William Orpen (IWM): \u00a0Jack Travers Cornwell (IWM): A Grenadier Guardsman by William Orpen, 1917 (IWM)</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_2112\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/alisonsye42.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-2112\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/alisonsye42.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=680\" alt=\"Field Marshal Haig by William Orpen, 1917 (IWM):  Churchill by William Orpen, 1916 (copyright National Portrait Gallery): Edith Cavell, 1910s (NPG): Soldier with Facial Wounds by Henry Tonks, 1916-18 (copyright The Royal College of Surgeons): Major J.B.

This version was published by Random House in 1975. The quality of the print is exquisite (my phone pictures do no justice) and the paper is that lovely heavy matt I&#8217;m always ranting about. Surprisingly, the pages were stapled together, you can usually expect a bit of beautiful stitching with paper of this weight. Needless to say, the pages have all fallen out. Of course, the book was ripped and torn and in a general bad state of repair, otherwise I wouldn&#8217;t consider cutting it. Usual rules apply, I never cut up a book which could otherwise be read.</p>\n<p>Instead of my usual food packaging, I&#8217;ve used some old Paperchase Christmas cards as a base. A friend gave me a couple of packs a few years ago, which she had bought in the sale. She decided not to use them because they seemed faulty, sort of a rubbery glue on the back, maybe a printing problem? Anyway, the glue came off easily with a razor blade.

I apologise for the briefness and the rubbish photos.</p>\n<p>I made this little piece in Barcelona last month, just adding the final touches in London.</p>\n<p>On a visit to the Picasso Museum, those little dogs (at least, I think they are dogs) he painted, as part of \u00a0Las Meninas series, made me smile. I have seen reproductions of these paintings many times, but never really looked at the dogs properly. But in the flesh, the dogs were the first thing I noticed. I did lots of sketching in the museum, it was bliss.</p>\n<p>I made most of this at the flat we were renting. When I started, I didn&#8217;t know it was going to end up with a dog (more like a fox, in this case) in the foreground. It just sort of evolved. There is another similar piece I am working on, but apart from that I will make no more like this. Although, I do plan to do a piece entitled &#8216;The Long-Legged Dogs of Barcelona&#8217;, inspired by an observation my daughter made. But it could be twenty years before that comes about.</p>\n<p>As usual everything I used had been discarded.</p>\n<p>The base of the picture was a postcard from Centre de Cultura Contemporania de Barcelona (CCCB), which I painted with green paint and then scratched with a chopstick (from Wok To Walk near Jaume 1). I have tried to take a photo of the postcard next to the finished piece, so you can see how I ended up with those particular shapes. The woman is the sky. Not sure who she is, does anyone know? She looks like Kim Novak.</p>\n<p>The little houses were windows cut from one big building. I made a note of the leaflet, but I can&#8217;t find it. Hopefully, I will add this information at a later date.</p>\n<p>The dog was drawn and painted on a leaflet, also from CCCB.</p>\n<p>The houses are sewn with some pale yellow thread I bought in a charity shop in Barcelona. The dog is sewn with red thread from El Corte Ingles. I wouldn&#8217;t have bought this, if I had stumbled upon the charity shop first.</p>\n<p>I am putting it into the Barcelona section of my <a href=\"http://folksy.com/shops/alisonsye/\" target=\"_blank\">shop</a>.<br />\n<a href=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/wpid-img_20140917_132552.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full\" title=\"IMG_20140917_132552.jpg\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/wpid-img_20140917_132552.jpg\" alt=\"image\" /></a></p>\n<div style=\"width: 1385px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/wpid-img_20140917_130858.jpg\"><img title=\"IMG_20140917_130858.jpg\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/wpid-img_20140917_130858.jpg?w=1375&#038;h=1455\" alt=\"image\" width=\"1375\" height=\"1455\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">This is the back, which I always prefer.

Every time I open a box of brochures, I find the most beautiful piece of A4 card positioned on top, to protect the goods. Depending on who opens the box, the card is either saved for me, or put in the bin.</p>\n<p>On the back of the postcard, where the message is written, I have sewn a bit of index card and a piece of Filofax divider. Again taken from the bin, this time in the doctors&#8217; waiting room.</p>\n<p>I have tried to give all of the leaflets credit in my diagram above, but in some cases a little bit extra is needed:</p>\n<p>C and D. We had two lovely meals in Buenas Migas, during one of them I spilled a whole glass of wine over my daughter&#8217;s feet. I have cleaned her sandals lots of times, but they are still sticky. Every time I walked by Buenas Migas, I helped myself to a used tray mat from a recently vacated table.</p>\n<p>E. This came from a leaflet from MACBA, I am sorry to say I don&#8217;t know the artist. Anyone?</p>\n<p>J. An empty sugar wrapper from Granja M. Viader, a wonderful old Barcelona milk bar. It was established 140 years ago.

I like it this way, I feel like I know everyone personally. Only two people gave the correct answer. Only two people entered. They are both lovely.</p>\n<p>The giveaway was totally unplanned, so I didn&#8217;t have a prize in mind. I was sorting through a shoe box yesterday, and I found these postcards.

The business side of my operation is not my strong point. They don&#8217;t teach you to do impromptu giveaways at 8am on a Sunday at Harvard Business School.</p>\n<p>So today, and possibly Friday, I am going to try to list some of the stuff sitting in shoe boxes under the bed. The three shown here are now in stock.</p>\n<p>They are very, very, very eco-friendly, as everything used in their making was destined for the bin.</p>\n<p>They are made from cereal boxes and an old copy of &#8216;The Surprise Party&#8217; by Pat Hutchins. The book was published in 1972 (Penguin, in association with The Bodley Head), making the front these cards 41 years old. They are not reproductions, they are made from the actual book. I never cut up books which could still be read, this particular copy was rather moldy in places (none of this on the cards, though). I acquired it some years ago, and couldn&#8217;t bear to see it thrown away.</p>\n<p>Pat Hutchins won a scholarship to Darlington School of Art (a few miles from my home town) in 1958. She has written and illustrated about 50 books, and given countless children lots of pleasure over the years. One of these children was me. I can remember the lovely Mrs. Yates reading this to my class when I was sixish. Mrs. Yates was a hippy, and I loved her. I was totally beguiled by the illustrations. Here was a person who had outlined her images in dark green, not black. Was that allowed? I think I can trace my colourful sewing outlines right back to Pat Hutchins, now I come to think about it.</p>\n<p>I am now going to list some <a href=\"http://alisonsye.wordpress.com/2013/12/13/2-percy-drake-brookshaw-1963-birthday-postcards/\" target=\"_blank\">Drake Brookshaw number cards.</a></p>\n<p>Alison x</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1091\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/alisonsyes212.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1091\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/alisonsyes212.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=711\" alt=\"212\"   /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">212</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_1088\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/alisonsyes209.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1088\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/alisonsyes209.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=787\" alt=\"209\"   /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">209</p></div>\n<p><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/alisonsyes212b.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1096\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/alisonsyes212b.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=722\" alt=\"alisonsyeS212b\"   /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 2321, "location": false, "date": "10-01-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Eco Christmas Card", "Collage", "upcycle", "postcard", "Vintage", "Tablecloth", "original", "1980s", "eco", "alisonsye", "cereal box", "recycle", "Candle", "Eco Christmas", "Christmas"], "text": "<div id=\"attachment_2332\" style=\"width: 768px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/alisonsye90.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-2332\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/alisonsye90.jpg?w=758&#038;h=1024\" alt=\"90\"   /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">90</p></div>\n<p>When I was married, my mam gave me this tablecloth as a gift. It had been the tablecloth she brought out of the airing cupboard every Christmas. It was only ever used for that one meal. So, I\u2019m guessing it had 16 airings.</p>\n<p>Mam can\u2019t remember when and where she bought it. It had a bit of a fifties vibe to it, so maybe it was passed down. She can\u2019t remember any details. What she can remember, however, is me cutting a huge hole from the middle of it when I was about 17 (1984 \u2013 my Dad was on strike at the time, I\u2019m using this as an excuse) to make myself a scarf-cum-bandanna\u00a0to tie around my head. There was no print in the middle of the tablecloth, \u00a0just plain red \u2013 I was going for a kind of New Romantic look. After 1984 it was never used again, obviously. Mam was furious.</p>\n<p>When I opened the gift I couldn\u2019t believe it, because annoyingly Mam never keeps anything. She found it in my cupboard at home and\u00a0thought\u00a0it would give me a laugh. There it was, complete with hole and gravy stain (she makes the BEST gravy) on one of the candles.</p>\n<p>In January 2013, I made six postcards with the candles on the cloth. I have two left.</p>\n<p>I have just listed this one in my <a href=\"http://folksy.com/shops/alisonsye/\" target=\"_blank\">shop</a>.</p>\n<p>The usual rules apply.

It was free entry, although there is a small fee for some exhibitions, and reminded me of my beloved Festival Hall. A massive space with lovely comfy seating and reliable toilets. In 1911 it was a textile factory, and has been impeccably restored. Well worth a visit. We saw two fantastic exhibitions, &#8216;Small Treasures of the Prado&#8217; and &#8216;Sorolla &#8211; The Colours of The Sea&#8217;.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Square E</span> was taken from a leaflet we were handed as we waited in the queue to get into La Sagrada Familia. This was the longest queue I have ever seen in my life. The leaflet pretty much told us what fools we were for not having booked online.

You can have a wonky nose and a crooked mouth and a double chin and stick-out teeth, but if you have good thoughts they will shine out of your face like sunbeams and you will always look lovely.&#8217; Roald Dahl, The Twits.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s not to like?</p>\n<p>Leaving books on trains, for strangers, is something I have been doing for a while. I do it on a whim, without structure. Thought it might be a nice idea to do it every Sunday, or maybe Saturday.</p>\n<p>You wouldn&#8217;t believe the amount of books we have in our house, no really, you wouldn&#8217;t believe it.</p>\n<p>Take this one for example, The Twits, we have four copies, all from various charity shops. I like to give them to visiting children. I am making it my mission this week to give three copies away. The books in our house are taking up too much space, I need to pass them on.</p>\n<p>Before I had the children, and before I was ill, I was a full-time primary school teacher. My favourite part of the day was having the children snuggle up on the cushions to listen to a story.

Murray. Illustrated by Harry Wingfield. First published by Ladybird in 1965, not sure when this edition was published, but it cost 24p.</strong></span></p>\n<p>Harry Wingfield died on 5th March, 2002 at the age of ninety-one.</p>\n<p>He taught me to read. Not in person, but by making the reading of those relentlessly boring Peter and Jane \u2018stories\u2019 more bearable. I loved looking at his illustrations. The family in the pictures were far removed from my own family, but I appreciated those watercolours nevertheless.</p>\n<p>He was a freelance illustrator for Ladybird Books for three decades, retiring in the 1980s. He portrayed a wholesome world, without divorce and disobedient children. Jane helped Mummy in the kitchen and Peter helped Daddy with the car. \u00a0Although, in the 1970s Jane ditched her pretty frock for jeans. We did that sort of thing in the Seventies.</p>\n<p>I loved his work then, and I love it now. He also did some abstract stuff, for the Ladybird Junior Science series.</p>\n<p>Laters,</p>\n<p>Alison x</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2431\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/alisonsyeup375.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-2431\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/alisonsyeup375.jpg?w=300&#038;h=295\" alt=\"Upcyclist 375\" width=\"300\" height=\"295\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Upcyclist 375</p></div>\n<p><a href=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/alisonsyeup375b.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2432\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/alisonsyeup375b.jpg?w=288&#038;h=300\" alt=\"AlisonSyeUp375b\" width=\"288\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2422\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/alisonsyeup400b.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-2422\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/alisonsyeup400b.jpg?w=300&#038;h=284\" alt=\"Upcyclist 400\" width=\"300\" height=\"284\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Upcyclist 400</p></div>\n<p><a href=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/alisonsyeup400.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2423\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/alisonsyeup400.jpg?w=300&#038;h=294\" alt=\"AlisonSyeup400\" width=\"300\" height=\"294\" /></a></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2424\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/alisonsyeup367b.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-2424\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/alisonsyeup367b.jpg?w=300&#038;h=268\" alt=\"Upcyclist 367\" width=\"300\" height=\"268\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Upcyclist 367</p></div>\n<p><a href=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/alisonsyeup367.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2425\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/alisonsyeup367.jpg?w=300&#038;h=291\" alt=\"AlisonSyeup367\" width=\"300\" height=\"291\" /></a><a href=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/alisonsyeup362.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2426\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/alisonsyeup362.jpg?w=300&#038;h=290\" alt=\"AlisonSyeup362\" width=\"300\" height=\"290\" /></a><a href=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/alisonsyeup367c.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2427\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/alisonsyeup367c.jpg?w=300&#038;h=255\" alt=\"AlisonSyeup367c\" width=\"300\" height=\"255\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 2420, "location": false, "date": "10-08-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["upcycle", "Mothers' Day", "White Rabbit", "eco", "Vintage", "Father's Day", "original", "Children's Books", "Eco Art", "recycle", "Train Set", "alisonsye", "Ladybird Book", "greetings card", "cereal box", "Vintage Car", "Children"], "text": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/alisonsyeup342.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-2435\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/alisonsyeup342.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=1013\" alt=\"AlisonSyeup342\"   /></a></p>\n<p>I am making a determined attempt to get some of the \u2018old stock\u2019 from under my bed, and into the sale section of my\u00a0<a href=\"http://folksy.com/shops/alisonsye/\" target=\"_blank\">shop</a>.

First published in 1962, but this edition was published by Hippo in 1989.</span></strong></p>\n<p>I have no recollection of acquiring the book, but I\u2019m sure it will have been beyond repair.</p>\n<p>I adore Bemelmans, he was something of a maverick. If you are not familiar with the Madeline books, boy they are good. At first glance you are taken in by the beautiful illustrations.</p>\n<p>And then you meet Madeline:</p>\n<p><em>\u2018She was not afraid of mice,</em></p>\n<p><em>She loved winter, snow, and ice,</em></p>\n<p><em>To the tiger in the zoo</em></p>\n<p><em>Madeline just said, \u201cPooh-Pooh\u201d \u2018</em></p>\n<p>Did I mention all of the books rhyme? Except \u2018Madeline\u2019, who never quite rhymes. The publishers wanted this changed, but Bemelmans wouldn\u2019t budge. See what I mean? What\u2019s not to like?</p>\n<p>Once you know feisty Madeline, you are hooked, she takes no messing. A spunky female role model. A free spirit. She attends a boarding school in Paris. Pepito, the Spanish Ambassador\u2019s son lives next door. In this book, Pepito moves to London and the schoolgirls visit him.</p>\n<p>Madeline (who by the way, celebrates her 75th birthday this year) is a character who stays with you, like Pooh, Clarice Bean, Pi and Jesse Pinkman. But I don\u2019t know who I love more, Madeline, or Bemelmans himself.</p>\n<p>Bemelmans lived life on his own terms. He was born in 1898 in Austria/Hungry and died in New York City in 1962, at the age of 64. He became an American citizen in 1918. He didn\u2019t start writing until he was 46, and had his first book published when he was 50. Again, what is not to like?</p>\n<p>There are many Bemelmans quotes, but this is my favourite, \u201cWe are writing for children, but not for idiots.\u201d</p>\n<p>See you soon,</p>\n<p>Alison x</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/alisonsyeup428b.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2446\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/alisonsyeup428b.jpg?w=279&#038;h=300\" alt=\"AlisonSyeup428b\" width=\"279\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2447\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/alisonsyeup429.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-2447\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/alisonsyeup429.jpg?w=300&#038;h=296\" alt=\"Upcyclist 429\" width=\"300\" height=\"296\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Upcyclist 429</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_2448\" style=\"width: 304px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/alisonsyeup433.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-2448\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/alisonsyeup433.jpg?w=294&#038;h=300\" alt=\"Upcyclist 433\" width=\"294\" height=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Upcyclist 433</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_2449\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/alisonsyeupcyclisttower.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-2449\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/alisonsyeupcyclisttower.jpg?w=300&#038;h=290\" alt=\"I didn't number this one for some reason.\" width=\"300\" height=\"290\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">I didn&#8217;t number this one for some reason.</p></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "post_id": 2443, "location": false, "date": "10-08-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Collage", "upcycle", "eco", "Burma Death Railway", "napkin", "Eco Art", "The Narrow Road To The Deep North", "Richard Flanagan", "Prisoner Of War Camp", "alisonsye", "Embroidery", "Archie Flanagan", "recycle", "Prisoner Of War", "original", "World War Two", "Man Booker Prize"], "text": "<p><a href=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/alisonsye.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-2463\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/alisonsye.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=680\" alt=\"AlisonSye\"   /></a></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Tuesday, 14th October</span></strong></p>\n<p>I have been making notes all month, but it wasn&#8217;t until Richard Flanagan gave me a kick up the backside that I actually started sewing.</p>\n<p>Whilst watching television, late on Tuesday night, \u00a0I heard the announcement that Flanagan had won the Man Booker Prize for his novel, &#8216;The Narrow Road To The Deep North&#8217;. I have not read the book. I will read it in about eight months, when it starts hitting the charity shops by the shelf-load.</p>\n<p>It took twelve years and five versions to complete.</p>\n<p>The book is set during The Second World War. It was inspired by his father, Archie Flanagan, who spent three and a half years in a Japanese prisoner of war camp. Fourteen thousand people died in the camp.</p>\n<p>335, is the POW number given to Archie Flanagan. He died shortly after the book was completed.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday morning Richard was interviewed on &#8216;Breakfast&#8217;. He talked about his father telling him how it felt to be starving, in your brain and your belly. He told him what \u00a0a rotting ulcer smelled like. &#8220;The truth exists in those small, but very real, details,&#8221; he said. \u00a0He told of how he had gone and met one of the guards, whilst researching his book. \u00a0A man the prisoners called The Lizard.</p>\n<p>I decided that I really liked Richard. He said his grandparents had been illiterate. He said the prize money would allow him to continue writing. I am glad.</p>\n<p>Have a good weekend,</p>\n<p>Alison x</p>\n<p>PS.

If there is a wife, then the widow has a choice:</p>\n<p>1. She can place her name in front, e.g. Alison, Duchess of Bromley</p>\n<p>2. She can place &#8216;doweger&#8217; in front e.g. Dowager Duchess of Bromley</p>\n<p>In short, it means that your highly titled husband is dead, you still want to be a duchess, but your son&#8217;s wife got in the way.</p>\n<p>I hate titles, and hope that I would have the strength to turn it down in the unlikely event of receiving one.</p>\n<p>I like what Danny Boyle said when he was offered a knighthood.

Yay!</p>\n<p>It is now in my <a href=\"http://folksy.com/shops/alisonsye/\" target=\"_blank\">shop</a>.</p>\n<p>You probably think I have made loads of napkins, due to the amount of posts, but in fact I have only made three. One for May (this one), one for June (exhibited at <a href=\"http://mallgalleries.org.uk\" target=\"_blank\">The Mall Galleries</a>, 14-23rd November, 2014), and one for October.</p>\n<p>Even though I haven&#8217;t blogged about it much, I have actually finished my May napkin. I finished it towards the end of September. However, as usual, I am way behind with the recording of the piece.</p>\n<p>I have already done <a href=\"http://alisonsye.wordpress.com/2014/09/09/5-may-2014/\" target=\"_blank\">five posts</a>, and am going to continue now, in a bit of a blogging frenzy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>17th May</strong></span></p>\n<p>David Abbott, creator of one of the most memorable adverts of my youth, died today. I am not making it up when I say that I cried every single time that darn advert came on television. The advert in question was for Yellow Pages, in which an old man crawled up and down the bookshops of Charing Cross Road looking for a book called &#8216;Fly Fishing by J.R. Hartley&#8217;. He had no luck, until his daughter gave him a copy of the Yellow Pages. I won&#8217;t spoil the ending. It&#8217;s on YouTube if you want to see it. I would add the link if I knew how.</p>\n<p>The advert was made in 1983, when I was sixteen. I didn&#8217;t recognise the street at the time. I had never been to London before. A few years later, as a student, Charing Cross Road and the roads leading off it, became my favourite area of London. It still is. I had the great pleasure of working in Foyles, in the late Eighties, a law unto itself. I could tell you stories, but you wouldn&#8217;t believe them. Unless, of course, you also worked at Foyles before the Reformation, and then you know. At the time there were still a few old London cafes in the area, alas all gone now. St. Giles&#8217; is almost unrecognisable these days.</p>\n<p>Enjoy the weekend,</p>\n<p>Alison x</p>\n<p>PS.\u00a0On a different subject, I would like an artist/maker blogger do do a blog hop with me.

How Does My Process Work?</strong></p>\n<p>I make art, usually sewn collages, from stuff others discard. I find something, like a sock in the road, or a piece of lace in a charity shop. I take it home and put it in a shoe box. Later, it will find its way into my work. &#8216;Later&#8217; could be the next day, or in thirty years time. I set no timescale, everything is waiting to be used. It doesn&#8217;t bother me how long a piece takes to complete. I am not in a rush. I have to be selective about what I keep, because I don&#8217;t have \u00a0storage space. In an ideal world, I would keep everything.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/alisonsye41.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1908\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/alisonsye41.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=843\" alt=\"alisonsye4\"   /></a></p>\n<p><strong>2. How Does My Work Differ From Others Of Its Genre?</strong></p>\n<p>I am not sure what my genre is, and whatever it is, there is probably someone else doing it too. Nothing in the world is new.</p>\n<p>I guess the fact that all of my materials absolutely must be unfit for purpose, is a little different. I don&#8217;t cut up books unless they have completely conked out and cannot be read by others, pages missing and the like. As for clothes, I would much rather someone else got some wear out of them, they must be really worn out before I use them in my work. I see beauty in everything. If possible, I try not to buy new materials, and that includes needles and thread.</p>\n<p>My blogging is a little different too, in that I don&#8217;t record the process, so much as the history of the materials I use. The blogging is my least favourite part, but feel compelled to do it, so that the information is not lost. I feel obliged to record the name of a person who once inscribed their name in a book I have used. It may seem unnecessary, but it will matter to someone. The story of the materials I use, is an important part of my work. This is a little piece I made from some old uniforms, worn by myself and my colleagues.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/alisonsye29.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-3074\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/alisonsye29.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=908\" alt=\"AlisonSye2\"   /></a></p>\n<p><strong>3. What Am I Working On?</strong></p>\n<p>I have at least thirty projects on the go. Some, I can&#8217;t continue until I find the missing part. At the moment, my work \u00a0is small, because I don&#8217;t have a studio, and do a lot of work on public transport. When I was a student, and had the luxury of more space, my work was massive. I take what I can.</p>\n<p>I have two projects which are near completion. One is a <a href=\"http://alisonsye.wordpress.com/2014/10/10/5-barcelona-patchwork/\" target=\"_blank\">patchwork of leaflets</a> I collected on holiday in Barcelona. This is a small section. When it is finished it will have 81 squares.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/alisonsye4a.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-2343\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/alisonsye4a.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=1024\" alt=\"AlisonSye4a\"   /></a></p>\n<p>The other is a <a href=\"http://alisonsye.wordpress.com/2014/11/20/6-napkin-diary-for-november-2014/\" target=\"_blank\">sewn diary</a> for the month of November. Each day, I record something which I consider to be significant.\u00a0I have made three <a href=\"http://alisonsye.wordpress.com/2014/11/17/26-napkin-diary-for-may-2014/\" target=\"_blank\">other diaries</a> this year.

Why Do I Do What I Do?</strong></p>\n<p>I have no idea. I don&#8217;t make any money out of it, so it&#8217;s not for that. I am from a very working class background. My dad was a miner and my mam cleaned other people&#8217;s houses. There is no getting away from the fact that making art is pure self indulgence, and I constantly struggle with the guilt of that.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>My nominees are the artist <a href=\"http://thefutureispapiermache.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Richard Guest</a> and maker of beautiful things\u00a0<a href=\"http://onebuntingaway.blogspot.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Giova Brusa</a>, both of whom have great blogs with beautiful photography.

Nothing, or very little information about her life. Plenty of books, she has written and illustrated, but not much about her as a person. Eventually, I found some details on a 1976 dust jacket. At the time she was living in Greenwich, London, with her husband and two children. She had been a teacher, and taught in primary schools in Deptford and Bermondsey.</p>\n<p>John Cuncliffe, however, could be my specialist subject on Mastermind. My job here, though, is to give the illustrator credit. So please accept my apologies, Celia.</p>\n<p>As to the history of this particular book\u2026no idea where I acquired it.</p>\n<p>I am making a determined attempt to get some of the \u2018old stock\u2019 from under my bed, and into the sale section of my\u00a0<a href=\"http://folksy.com/shops/alisonsye/\" target=\"_blank\">shop</a>.

He was born in 1930 and grew up in a small mining village in the north of England. Being a miner&#8217;s daughter from the north myself, I need no more than this to like him. However, there is a lot more to like, not least his wonderful children&#8217;s books.</p>\n<p>The book I am about to start butchering I have had for a long time, but up until now I haven&#8217;t been able to bring my scalpel to it.

But that&#8217;s just it, what I am about to do is give it a &#8216;face lift&#8217;, and despite the rips, doodles and missing page it is still a thing of absolute beauty. It does not need a &#8216;face lift&#8217;. Does any &#8216;face lift&#8217; improve the face? I have yet to see one which does.</p>\n<p>It was first published in 1967, this edition in 1969, and \u00a0has been printed by a craftsman. The paper is matt and heavy, almost fabric, and the print is crisp and clear. Modern editions can&#8217;t hold a candle to it. The card of the cover is so thick, I will probably need to use a saw to cut it. The stitching holding the pages together is a work of art in itself. This book was made to last. And so it has, it is 44 years old.</p>\n<p>As for the beautiful \u00a0illustrations, they speak for themselves. Colour everywhere, rich and intense. There is no story, each page shows a group of birds. A party of \u00a0jays. A watch of nightingales. \u00a0Wildsmith is the master.</p>\n<p>It is an unbreakable policy of mine \u00a0never to cut up a book which could still be read. Despite this, I still find it hard to do. This book, without a doubt, has been the hardest. I have had it for months, unable to damage it further. This morning I got it out again, and thought about all the people to whom it has given pleasure. I actually have had it so long I can&#8217;t remember how I acquired it, although I think it was in a batch given to me by a local primary school. I have torn out the pages which weren&#8217;t already torn and intend to use every last inch of it, like a good butcher respecting the life of the animal.</p>\n<p>There is a fading sticker inside the front cover which reads, &#8216;K.J. (possibly I.) Bredon&#8217;s Bookshop, East Street, Brighton&#8217;.</p>\n<p>I would love to show you lots of images but I am worried about copyright issues, which I can&#8217;t understand because there are Wildsmith illustrations all over the internet.</p>\n<p>To date I have made 461 cards from books and clothes, each individually numbered. None of these cards have been recorded in this way. Today I am starting back at number one. This is my first blog entry and it seems only fitting that the work of Brian Wildsmith should be top of the list.</p>\n<p>Still got &#8216;first post jitters&#8217; and my leeks are burnt, just read back through it about twenty times, seems a little stiff. May I just say here that I am not a writer or a photographer, I just want to record the making of my stuff.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alisonsye.wordpress.com/2013/01/11/1-birds-by-brian-wildsmith-1967-this-edition-1969/alisonsye19/#main\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-35\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-35\" alt=\"alisonsye19\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/alisonsye19.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=738\" width=\"1024\" height=\"738\" /></a><a href=\"http://alisonsye.wordpress.com/2013/01/11/1-birds-by-brian-wildsmith-1967-this-edition-1969/attachment/023/#main\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-38\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-38\" alt=\"023\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/023.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=474\"   /></a></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_56\" style=\"width: 773px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.wordpress.com/2013/01/11/1-birds-by-brian-wildsmith-1967-this-edition-1969/alisonsye25-2/#main\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-56\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-56\" alt=\"Inside the dust jacket\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/alisonsye251.jpg?w=763&#038;h=1024\" width=\"763\" height=\"1024\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Inside the dust jacket</p></div>\n", "post_id": 34, "location": false, "date": "01-11-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Tablecloths", "Valentine"], "text": "<p><strong>Numbers: 79 &#8211; 83</strong></p>\n<p>I have demolished the tablecloth without remorse, whilst listening to episodes of &#8216;Just A Minute&#8217;.</p>\n<p>In its place stand some Valentine&#8217;s cards made from cereal boxes.</p>\n<p>There are some hearts left over which I am eager to embroider and make into postcards.</p>\n<p>If I have followed the\u00a0instructions\u00a0correctly, they should now be in my Folksy <a href=\"http://folksy.com/shops/alisonsye\" target=\"_blank\">shop</a> (opened today, EXCITING!).</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_341\" style=\"width: 259px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/alisonsye79l.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-341\" alt=\"79\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/alisonsye79l.jpg?w=249&#038;h=300\" width=\"249\" height=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">79</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_342\" style=\"width: 262px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/alisonsye80l.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-342\" alt=\"80\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/alisonsye80l.jpg?w=252&#038;h=300\" width=\"252\" height=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">80</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_343\" style=\"width: 242px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/alisonsye81l.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-343\" alt=\"81\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/alisonsye81l.jpg?w=232&#038;h=300\" width=\"232\" height=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">81</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_344\" style=\"width: 266px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/alisonsye82l.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-344\" alt=\"82\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/alisonsye82l.jpg?w=256&#038;h=300\" width=\"256\" height=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">82</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_345\" style=\"width: 251px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/alisonsye83l.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-345\" alt=\"83\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/alisonsye83l.jpg?w=241&#038;h=300\" width=\"241\" height=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">83</p></div>\n", "post_id": 340, "location": false, "date": "01-25-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Tablecloths", "Embroidery", "Valentine"], "text": "<p><strong>Numbers: 84 &#8211; 89</strong></p>\n<p>Doing running stitch with the radio on is my idea of bliss.

We were now to have blue shirts and red ties, instead of red shirts and blue ties.</p>\n<p>As much as I hate wearing a uniform, I loved those red shirts. Red is blood. Red is solidarity. I liked, at the end of the day, as we tried to clear the gallery, to look over the balcony at the sea of red flowing toward the doors. Pale blue isn&#8217;t the same.</p>\n<p>We were asked to hand in our shirts, they could not be given to charity shops because of the logo, and most had seen better times.</p>\n<p>As the days passed, the mountain of shirts grew.</p>\n<p>I really wanted that mountain of shirts. Those shirts contained the blood, sweat, tears and coffee of us. Those shirts kept us in our place, or so it felt sometimes. The managers and curators didn&#8217;t wear them, the people on more than minimum wage, the people who tell us what to do. The people who don&#8217;t \u00a0know my name. Those shirts represent a lot.</p>\n<p>In the end it was too much, I just couldn&#8217;t let those shirts go. I had no idea what I was going to do with them, but those shirts had been worn by my colleages, day in and day out, good days and bad. I had to make something with them.</p>\n<p>As I started picking them up I realised I couldn&#8217;t take them without knowing who had worn them. I have always loved the way Van Gogh named his sitters as if he valued them as people, and hated the way Picasso often didn&#8217;t. In this \u00a0job I frequently feel like a non-person, so it became important to me \u00a0only to take the shirts with names. Looking back, I wish I had taken the lot. The fact that most of the shirts didn&#8217;t have a name is very symbolic, I didn&#8217;t see it at the time.</p>\n<p>My husband put them in the attic with a sigh, where they have been ever since.</p>\n<p>Last week I had an\u00a0urge\u00a0to do something with them, so now the house (I don&#8217;t have a studio) is full of red shirts, \u00a0just in time for my father-in-law&#8217;s visit tomorrow.</p>\n<p>So far, I have started embroidering words onto my collar, cut out a map of the area where I work, and, started to join squares taken from each shirt. Plenty of sewing to keep me busy on the train.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/alisonsye187s1.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-710\" alt=\"alisonsye187s\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/alisonsye187s1.jpg?w=793&#038;h=1024\"   /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/alisonsye184s1.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-711\" alt=\"alisonsye184s\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/alisonsye184s1.jpg?w=767&#038;h=1024\"   /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/alisonsye185s1.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-712\" alt=\"alisonsye185s\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/alisonsye185s1.jpg?w=691&#038;h=1024\"   /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/alisonsye87p.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-704\" alt=\"alisonsye87p\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/alisonsye87p.jpg?w=300&#038;h=258\" width=\"300\" height=\"258\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 696, "location": false, "date": "03-27-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["New Baby", "1967", "Wildsmith", "1969", "birds"], "text": "<p><strong>Numbers: 49, 50, 51, 52, 54, 55, 56, 57 and 58</strong></p>\n<p>This week I made postcards and listened to The Smiths.

This section of the map is the area covered by The National Gallery and The National Portrait Gallery. I intend the finished piece to be much larger.</p>\n<p>All of the faces have been cut from two issues of \u00a0&#8216;Completely London&#8217;, which regularly finds itself on my doormat. I don&#8217;t throw it away because it is a great read and a thing of beauty. If you don&#8217;t know it, it&#8217;s a high quality free magazine produced by the estate agents, Kinleigh Folkard and Hayward. It is not thrown together. It looks good, smells good, and often finds its way into my art &#8211; although, I never go searching for it and only ever use the copies which arrive, unannounced, at my door. The articles are generally about my favourite subject &#8211; people who are doing things against the grain. Above, are some of these people, plus some others who happened to fit nicely into the spaces. \u00a0Below, I aim to tell you who they are. I have sewn them onto my map out of admiration and with respect, and hope they see it that way.</p>\n<p>I am now going to try and name everybody correctly. In front of me I have a pile of notes and magazine remains&#8230;.. this may take longer than the sewing.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/alisonsye209s.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-728\" alt=\"alisonsye209s\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/alisonsye209s.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=807\"   /></a></p>\n<p>Numbers 1-19 are taken from Issue 11 and numbers 12-36 are taken from Issue 9.</p>\n<p>1.

Taken from a photograph by Rhapsody Media.</p>\n<p>13. Two images from a poster on the wall of a gorgeous house, in East Dulwich, belonging to Ben Anders (who took the photograph) and Vanessa Leigh-Anders. \u00a0Anyone know the artist?</p>\n<p>14. Street artist unknown, but is working on Belisha\u00a0beacons in EC1. Photograph by Patrick Dalton (see 1).</p>\n<p>15. I&#8217;m afraid this lady doesn&#8217;t get a credit, she is in a photograph to accompany an article about happiness. Jon Enoch (see 5) took the photograph.</p>\n<p>16.

I love it when he says, &#8220;I&#8217;m only looking for certain things. Things that speak to me. Imperfections are important and I don&#8217;t like things that are clean and spotless. I like things that have been used, that have a bit of history, a memory.&#8221; His other stuff is incredible, as well. I take my hat off to you, Stephen. The article was written by Jessica Cargill Thompson (see 3), and the photographs were taken by Ingrid Rasmussen (see 32).</p>\n<p>19. Harry Cloudfoot, who likes to shimmy along a low-strung piece of elastic between two trees. Slacklining, it&#8217;s called. \u00a0There are groups of people doing this in parks all over London.

Ronald Grant and Martin Humphries, co-founders of Kennington&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.cinemamuseum.org.uk\" target=\"_blank\">&#8216;Cinema Museum&#8217;</a> ( located in the Master&#8217;s House of the former Lambeth Workhouse, where Charlie Chaplin once lived.

Chris Pounds has been the farm manager at <a href=\"http://www.hackneycityfarm.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Hackney City Farm</a> for 12 years. This area was farmland up until the 1850&#8217;s, nice that it&#8217;s farmland again, satisfying.</p>\n<p>23. Penelope Koliopoulou is a brilliant young artist. In her photographs she plays both parts of an imaginary couple. She won first prize in a competition hosted by KFH to find new artistic talent.</p>\n<p>24a and b. Joseph Egan and Hunter Thomson met in a library (like them already) and create\u00a0installations\u00a0which need to be viewed from a certain angle. I love their work. The site listed in the magazine is colourblinddesign.com, I tried to add a link here &#8211; but kept getting a foodie website. Could be my fault.</p>\n<p>25. These absolutely wonderful illustrations were made by Annette Moi, who was highly commended in the competition won by Penelope Koliopoulou (see 23).</p>\n<p>26, 27 and 28 are all taken from a\u00a0beautifully\u00a0photographed (by Ingrid Rasmussen, see 32) article about the demise of the classic London caff.</p>\n<p>26. This lady is from Gambardella, a cafe in Vanbrugh Park, SE3. It opened in 1927 and is now run by James and Alex (perhaps this is her?) Petrillo. Part of the interior was an old Lyon&#8217;s tea room.</p>\n<p>27a and b. This couple don&#8217;t get a mention, but they are featured in a photograph of River Cafe, Putney Bridge Approach SW6.</p>\n<p>28. I&#8217;m assuming this is Nev Pellicci who runs E Pellicci in Bethnal Green. \u00a0E Pellicci (once a meeting place for the Krays) is listed and was established in 1900. I love the \u00a0beautifully written board (white writing on red) displaying hot drink\u00a0choices.</p>\n<p>29. Glenn Horder (here dressed as\u00a0Elizabeth\u00a0I &#8211; the rest of his outfit is amazing), who &#8216;has a repertoire of characters that ranges from Audrey Hepburn to the Queen&#8217;. Taken from an article about &#8216;those for whom the lure of the dressing-up box goes way beyond the odd outfit hire&#8217;. Photograph by Travis Hodges (see 35). I placed this picture on the area of my map which is the site of The National Portrait Gallery, as there are a couple of exquisite portraits of the real Elizabeth I on display there. I searched through my entire collection of magazines just to find this picture of Glenn, it was worth it. The National Portrait Gallery is on the site of a workhouse.</p>\n<p>30. Elizabeth II. \u00a0Part of a small article about events taking place to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee. Photograph by Cecil Beaton.</p>\n<p>31. These are lovely illustrations by Chris Bianchi, of Debut Art, for an article about the Great Beer Flood of 1814. A giant vat of beer, at a brewery now the site of The Dominion Theatre, \u00a0burst open and flooded the local area. Eight people were killed. The brewery was taken to court, but the judge found that the victims had died as an Act of God. Keith Barker-Main wrote this article, which I read three times.</p>\n<p>32. Ingrid Rasmussen, photographer. See 18, 26, 27 and 28.</p>\n<p>33. Karen Hodkinson, \u00a0journalist. See \u00a024.</p>\n<p>34. Edwin Heathcote, writer and architect.</p>\n<p>35. Travis Hodges, photographer. See \u00a09, 10, 11 and 29.</p>\n<p>36. Four images. Abi Lees, Tom Lancaster, Evie, and a lovely chalk drawing by Evie. It was taken from an article by Dominic Lutyens about &#8216;Shoe String Chic&#8217;, which shows how Abi and Tom decorated their beautiful home in Crouch End. \u00a0It was Evie&#8217;s chalk drawing that caught my attention, but I&#8217;m pleased that I also managed to squeeze in the artist and her parents.</p>\n<p>37. The only face not to be taken from &#8216;Completely London&#8217;. It is, of course, the face of Max from &#8216;Where The Wild Things Are&#8217; by the great Maurice Sendak, who died almost exactly a year ago. This map started out being a bit of a tribute to Sendak, but it took a\u00a0different\u00a0path as &#8216;Completely London&#8217; was pushed through my letterbox and I remembered that picture of Glenn dressed as Elizabeth I.</p>\n<p>This list is very much a work in progress, I have tried to credit \u00a0everyone \u00a0faithfully. I have tried to add all of the links given in the magazine. It has taken ages! I did it because it doesn&#8217;t seem right to use a picture of a person without mentioning who they are. and informing them (my next task). I have not enjoyed it as I have yearned to get back to my map, and also worried that I would offend someone. I hope I haven&#8217;t misspelled a name or missed someone out.

Occupying a shelf all by itself was the awesome (and I never use this word) Times Atlas of the World, almost the size of the world and just as heavy. (I know I am supposed to be writing about Aliki, but bear with me).</p>\n<p>I have always admired this book. As a child, I would look at it for hours in the reference section of my local library. The paper is good and thick, and has that mattness I lust after. I still love looking at maps. I never, tire of the London A &#8211; Z.</p>\n<p>In the nineties I worked at Stanford&#8217;s in London. If you don&#8217;t know it, it&#8217;s a travel book and map shop on Long Acre in Covent Garden. I had recently graduated from art college. \u00a0It was a great time in my life. I had just met my husband, he was working nearby for a small graphic design company. In Stanford&#8217;s, The Times Atlas of the World had a special display table with just one book on the top. I would open it to a different page every day. I can&#8217;t remember ever selling a copy, I think it was about a hundred pounds, even then.</p>\n<p>The Bromley edition was a mess. Sad, but made me happy because I would have no problem with the butchering. Many, many, many people had enjoyed this book. Dreaming of far off climes, or maybe showing their children a relative&#8217;s birthplace.</p>\n<p>I always knew the book would never be mine. I knew before I picked it up exactly how heavy it was. Even during my excitement at spotting it, I knew I wouldn&#8217;t be able to carry it home. I have spine issues. That&#8217;s my spine, not the book&#8217;s. I have carried forbidden things in the past, and painfully regretted doing so for months afterwards. I left the library\u00a0extremely\u00a0forlorn, I&#8217;m not exaggerating.</p>\n<p>I hope it went to a good home.</p>\n<p>About ten minutes later I called into a local charity shop. I still can&#8217;t believe my luck. There it was, My Visit To The Dinosaurs (first published in 1969, this edition 1972) by Aliki. I fantasize about finding a book by Aliki. I once did, but its condition was too good to use in my work. This one has lived a thousand lives. It is no stranger to\u00a0sellotape.\u00a0 Most of the pages are not attached to the spine, some have been reattached, quite obviously, out of sequence. It was once owned by a V. Stephens, who once owned a blue Biro and had neat handwriting.</p>\n<p>I can&#8217;t wait to breathe new life into it.</p>\n<p>Aliki Brandenburg was born in 1929, and grew up in Philadelphia as part of a big Greek family. She writes and illustrates the most beautiful of books. She says &#8220;Children&#8217;s books are a combination of two things I love: words and pictures&#8221;. Her two children, Jason and Alexa, appear in most of her illustrations. I believe that she now lives in London, although that may be wishful thinking.</p>\n<p>There are a few groovy dads visiting the dinosaurs, so if I can get my act together I may make a couple of Father&#8217;s Day cards.

It is made from old uniforms worn by my colleagues and myself. I first talked about them <a href=\"http://alisonsye.wordpress.com/2013/03/27/1-red-shirts/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://alisonsye.wordpress.com/2013/04/26/2-red-shirts/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>I have a number of projects involving \u00a0these shirts, but for this piece I always had in mind that I would add varnish to enable me to draw/write on it. However, I like it the way it is and want to live with it like this a while before making a decision about the drawing and the writing.</p>\n<p>I know who owned every bit of fabric, but out of respect for the owner I am not going to make this knowledge public. A few, sadly, would not give me their shirts, saying they were too messy or dirty. I really appreciate the fact that some people gave them to me anyway (even though they didn&#8217;t really want to), and so will not name them. Each shirt comes with a story.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/alisonsye84p.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-809\" alt=\"alisonsye84p\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/alisonsye84p.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=768\"   /></a></p>\n<p>I started with a pile of shirts like this. These came from a lovely young Polish girl with an incredible work ethic. In Poland she was a physiotherapist, now she wanders around the gallery telling people not to take photographs. Not that many people know her previous occupation, she does not tell you unless you ask. She is polite and kind to everyone. It is a pleasure to work with her.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/alisonsye94p.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-810\" alt=\"alisonsye94p\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/alisonsye94p.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=768\"   /></a></p>\n<p>So then I started piecing everyone together. I sewed small sections together first. Most of this sewing was done on the train either to or from work. Some of those collars are very stiff. If you follow me on facebook you may remember me trying to learn how to use a thimble (unsuccessfully). I do not have a studio, this is my actual lounge. We do not have another room, in this room we eat, watch tv, go on the computer et cetera (that one is for you, Gerard).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/alisonsye95p.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-811\" alt=\"alisonsye95p\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/alisonsye95p.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=693\"   /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/alisonsye103p.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-812\" alt=\"alisonsye103p\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/alisonsye103p.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=760\"   /></a></p>\n<p>I ended up with this. Now, should I varnish it, possibly ruining months of work? I just want to take a moment to tell you about the thread I used. I bought it as part of a very old bag of odds-and-ends in a charity shop. Would love to know the life history of that bag. \u00a0The main one I used is silk. Both are beautiful.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/alisonsye93p.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-813\" alt=\"alisonsye93p\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/alisonsye93p.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/alisonsye123p.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-814\" alt=\"alisonsye123p\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/alisonsye123p.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/alisonsye124p.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-815\" alt=\"alisonsye124p\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/alisonsye124p.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=768\"   /></a></p>\n<p>Apart from the first photograph, above is before the varnish and below is after the varnish. First there are sections, and then not a very good photograph of the whole piece, which is 76cms x 76cms. I was making it to be part of the staff art show. However, due to a lot of entries and lack of space, a size restriction was understandably imposed. So I won&#8217;t be able to display my work. Don&#8217;t despair though, I have made a smaller piece.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/alisonsye140p.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-816\" alt=\"alisonsye140p\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/alisonsye140p.jpg?w=785&#038;h=1024\"   /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/alisonsye141p.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-817\" alt=\"alisonsye141p\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/alisonsye141p.jpg?w=807&#038;h=1024\"   /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/alisonsye143p.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-818\" alt=\"alisonsye143p\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/alisonsye143p.jpg?w=772&#038;h=1024\"   /></a></p>\n<p>Below is the small version, here in the early stages, completed during the second week of Wimbledon. Very exciting. Stabbed my fingers multiple times. At one point there was actual blood. I would like to say that it dripped onto my work, but I would be lying. If you happen to be passing the gallery and fancy coming to see the staff art show, it starts tomorrow and details are below. You will be able to smell my work before you see it, it stinks. The last coat of varnish was administered very close to the submission deadline. I had to trim it down and leave it unframed so that it complies with the size rule.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/alisonsye146p.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-819\" alt=\"alisonsye146p\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/alisonsye146p.jpg?w=1019&#038;h=1024\"   /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/alisonsye.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-820\" alt=\"alisonsye\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/alisonsye.jpg?w=300&#038;h=257\" width=\"300\" height=\"257\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 807, "location": false, "date": "07-09-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["charity shop", "Collage", "cereal box", "upcycle", "1969", "Art", "eco", "postcard", "handmade", "1972", "Dinosaur", "alisonsye", "children's book", "Embroidery", "natural history museum", "Aliki", "unique", "original"], "text": "<div id=\"attachment_846\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/alisonsyes132pc1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-846\" alt=\"132\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/alisonsyes132pc1.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=741\"   /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">132</p></div>\n<p><strong>Numbers: 129 &#8211; 137</strong></p>\n<p>A while ago I started making cards using a lovely old copy of &#8216;My Visit To The Dinosaurs&#8217; by Aliki. You can find out about the book<a href=\"http://www.alisonsye.wordpress.com/2013/05/16/1-alikis-dinosaurs/\" target=\"_blank\"> here</a>, and the Father&#8217;s Day cards I made <a href=\"http://www.alisonsye.wordpress.com/2013/06/01/2-alikis-dinosaurs/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>This week I finished making eighteen postcards. They vary in size, but on average they are 14cms x 19cms. Parts of the book have been sewn onto food packaging. Each card is unique and is individually numbered.</p>\n<p>Well get me! I am offering nine of these cards, to one person, as a &#8216;Summer Giveaway&#8217; on my Facebook Page (I will \u00a0blog about the other nine later). The cards on offer are pictured in this post.</p>\n<p>All in all, I have spent the best part of eight hours trying to figure out how to do a promotion on Facebook. There are lots of boxes to tick, and I don&#8217;t know what some of them mean, neither do I understand the help given. I guess it is hard to give help to a person (me) who doesn&#8217;t really know what a widget, or an app (really), or tab is. I think I have made my giveaway visible only to people who have liked my page, this may be the wrong thing to do, not sure. If you cannot view it on your mobile, please let me know, in fact, I would appreciate any feedback about difficulties you have with this giveaway. I will apologise now.</p>\n<p>The promotion will start today, and end on 31st August 2013. I will select a winner at random on 1st September, 2013. The winner will be notified by email, as it is against Facebook Law to mention the winner on a timeline (or even by a private message). On the promotion form I only ticked the boxes requiring you to give your name and email address. I missed out the boxes requiring you to give more personal details &#8211; although, obviously, if you win you will be required to email your address to me. Only one entry is allowed per person.</p>\n<p>The package will not fit through your average letterbox.</p>\n<p>Hopefully, the giveaway is\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/alisonsye1\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Good luck to you (and me), and enjoy this lovely weather, long may it last.</p>\n<p>Alison x</p>\n<p>PS. My posts have been all over the place lately, sometimes three times in one week and then nothing for a month. From now on I am aiming to post every Friday. It may not happen, of course. I will try.

This is a first!</p>\n<p>I have spent the last couple of hours trying to sort through the 48 shoe boxes (stashed in every room in the house) filled with old cards. Leaving this task only to see how my <a href=\"http://a.pgtb.me/6P4N00\" target=\"_blank\">giveaway</a> was getting on. I have quite a lot of cards from some years ago which have my old name sewn on them. At first I started to make &#8216;blog about and sell cheaper&#8217; piles. But then I thought to just get on and do it now.</p>\n<p>This is a postcard I made about four years ago, maybe more, you know how it is.</p>\n<p>It is not in my usual style, as each one is printed onto an old accounts book. It is, however, made with cereal boxes. The accounts book came from the now legendary Camberwell Skip Haul of 1989.</p>\n<p>I had not started to number my work at this point.</p>\n<p>I intended to make three hundred &#8211; hence the three hundred printed on the front &#8211; but actually only made about eighty because my expensive ink was being used up at an alarming rate. I sold some, for \u00a35 each, and there are now fifty-two left in the box. They are not unique in my usual sense, as they all look the same at a glance. Each has been individually made though, and so is actually unique even though it doesn&#8217;t look it..</p>\n<p>I did not have the stamp stamp at the time of making, but as I am now in possession of the stamp stamp, I have used it.</p>\n<p>I have just added them to my <a href=\"http://www.folksy.com/shops/alisonsye\" target=\"_blank\">shop</a>, where I am selling them for \u00a32, for a pack of two.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/alisonsye300b.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-917\" alt=\"alisonsye300b\" src=\"https://alisonsye.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/alisonsye300b.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=729\"   /></a></p>\n<p>Enjoy the rest of your day,</p>\n<p>Alison</p>\n<p>P.S.

Since then I have had <a href=\"http://alisonsye.wordpress.com/2013/04/26/2-red-shirts/\" target=\"_blank\">various art projects</a> on the go, one of which was a piece for the recent <a href=\"http://alisonsye.wordpress.com/2013/07/09/3-red-shirts-first-piece-possibly-finished/\" target=\"_blank\">staff art show</a>.</p>\n<p>When it came to it, my piece was too big for the exhibition, so I hurriedly made something much smaller.

The guest (me) chooses a theme and some objects from a given list, and then produces something using these as inspiration. Tina does the same, and both results are posted. It is always interesting how different the pieces are &#8211; hence the post title.</p>\n<p>Anyway, my choice was &#8216;Picasso&#8217; as my theme, and &#8216;clothes&#8217; and &#8216;fabric&#8217; as my objects.</p>\n<p>I trawled through my many books about Picasso, and eventually came up with the above image, &#8216;The Meal&#8217;, painted exactly sixty years ago. Beautiful isn&#8217;t it? I changed my mind about which painting to use about a million times, but in the end the image of a mother feeding her two children was too autobiographical to let go. Also, the mother looks like me, unfortunately.</p>\n<p>Finding matching colours was more difficult than I expected, as usually I lay my hands on the exact piece straight away. I can&#8217;t believe it, but I have no plain black fabric on Fabric Mountain. It goes completely against my grain to buy \u00a0fabric especially, so I used a black and white print and made life much more difficult for myself. Finding<a href=\"http://alisonsye.wordpress.com/2013/03/27/1-red-shirts/\" target=\"_blank\"> red</a> was easy.</p>\n<p>The piece was six weeks in the making, and I enjoyed every minute. As usual, it was almost completely sewn on public transport. You can find it in my <a href=\"http://folksy.com/shops/alisonsye\" target=\"_blank\">shop</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>This is what I used:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Orange</strong> \u00a0A worn-out pair of my husband&#8217;s boxer shorts. I bought these on Christmas Eve 1996 from the Next near to Charing Cross Station. They were a last minute Christmas gift (along with an orange jumper, bought at the same time) en route to Wales (via my first ever visit to Paddington Station), where we were going to spend our first Christmas away from our respective families. It is the only time I have ever been to Wales. When we arrived at the very small station (can&#8217;t remember where), it was dark and snowing. It was Christmas Eve&#8217;. It was magical. We called a cab from a callbox, as suggested by the hotel. A cab pulled up and a very grumpy driver drove us about 15 paces to the hotel. I have never felt so bad in my life. The boxer shorts were not passed on to another user for obvious reasons. My husband will be devastated when he reads this post, but in fact these shorts have proved useful for many other projects (unknown to him) already &#8211; remember those icons?</p>\n<p><strong>Purple and Green</strong>\u00a0Shirts given to me by my friend Del, who drove me to Lewisham Hospital when I went into labour.</p>\n<p><strong>Black</strong> From a black and white print shirt. I wore this a lot in the Eighties, it was about twenty sizes too big.</p>\n<p><strong>Cream</strong> As above, but replace my friend Corrinne for me, and cream silk for black and white print.</p>\n<p><strong>Blue</strong> My daughter&#8217;s too-small Monsoon skirt. I bought this from a charity shop so it was already the worse for wear. By the time my daughter had finished with it it was covered in various art materials. She loved it and wore it to death.</p>\n<p><strong>Yellow</strong> Jade&#8217;s dress.

That&#8217;s me in the top left corner. There are 19 different uniforms in this piece, and I know who owned each and where they are positioned.</p>\n<p>It had crossed my mind that I could enter it in the annual Discerning Eye Exhibition. Anyone can enter, you just hand in your smallish work (at the Mall Galleries) and pay a tenner, and then wait to see if you are selected. I&#8217;ve never entered before.</p>\n<p>So today, I decided that I would give it a try and trotted along after work. Very long queue. \u00a0Everyone&#8217;s art was professionally framed, except mine. You have to hand it in without packaging, so you can see all of the work. They were all neatly taped up at the back. Mine wasn&#8217;t.</p>\n<p>I felt a bit embarrassed about my frame, but there is a story behind it.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://alisonsye.wordpress.com/2013/07/09/3-red-shirts-first-piece-possibly-finished/\" target=\"_blank\">large uniform piece</a>, currently nailed to my wall, turned out to be \u00a3280 to get framed. I am not complaining about this, I don&#8217;t want it framed cheaply. \u00a0I believe in paying well for a job well done. I found a lovely framer in Beckenham, the same day I found <a href=\"http://alisonsye.wordpress.com/2013/08/30/busy-woman-tablecloth/\" target=\"_blank\">that tablecloth</a>. However, I do not have \u00a3280, so the framing will have to wait. I mentioned this to a friend, as I was sewing this small piece. My friend is pretty skint, has no car, and lives nowhere near Ikea. This did not stop her trekking to aforementioned shop, buying me a frame and surprising me with it. It was lovely of her.</p>\n<p>I wanted to yell at everyone in the queue &#8220;My lovely friend bought this for me&#8221;, as some of them were so obviously looking down their noses at my frame, or maybe it was my work, I&#8217;ve only just thought of that.</p>\n<p>So anyway, I&#8217;ve handed it in, a little concerned that I haven&#8217;t met the &#8216;framing criteria&#8217;.</p>\n<p>The

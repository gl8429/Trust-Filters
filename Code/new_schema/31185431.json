her vet&#8217;s instructions, has been on bedrest.\u00a0 I thought that she was going to drive me nuts because she is a very active dog even now that she is almost 11 years old.\u00a0 To my surprise, and delight, she has taken this time off from walking quite well.\u00a0 I take her for a walk, twice a day, for about 15 minutes each time, but no longer than that.</p>\n<p><a

she loves to do.\u00a0 I taught her to go up and down the stairs slowly.\u00a0 How?\u00a0 I started by walking with her on a leash while telling her &#8220;slowly,&#8221; and extending my left arm so she understands that she cannot go beyond my arm.\u00a0 Within a couple of days\u00a0I was able to do this without using a leash.\u00a0</p>\n<p>She has another month to go and I know she enjoys her long walks, but\u00a0I want her to recuperate therefore we&#8217;ll stick with short walks.\u00a0 I still can&#8217;t believe that my beautiful girl will turn 11 in May 5th.\u00a0 I hope to share many, many more walks with her.</p>\n", "post_id": 1074, "location": false, "date": "04-11-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["home dog boarding", "Dog", "walk", "Leash",

Sarris.\u00a0 It took them a couple of minutes to get settle, and this is what they looked like after they sniffed Alex and Josie.\u00a0 The novelty wore off for all of them in a matter of 5 to 10 minutes.\u00a0 When I introduce dogs to one another, I always take them for a walk, let them sniff each other during our walk and after about 40-60 minutes we come home.</p>\n<p><a

it this time because it was raining very hard today.\u00a0 So, what did I do?\u00a0 I put all of them on a leash and allowed them to sniff each other while watching their body language: relaxed, curious, but calm.\u00a0 After a couple of minutes I removed their leashes and collars, as you can see in the picture, and they were off to sniff our kitchen while I was watching them.\u00a0 I do prefer to walk them as a way of introducing them to a new dog, but when the weather does not cooperate I have to improvise.\u00a0 Always, and this is very important, look at the body language of the dog.\u00a0 If he is tense, fixated on one dog, does not move, etc., chances are that he is ready to strike.\u00a0 My best recommendation is: if you are bringing a new dog home, go for a long walk with all of them, 40-60 minutes, and then go home.\u00a0 Living with dogs should not be stressful, but rather enjoyable and rewarding, but it&#8217;s up to you to make this happen.\u00a0 Enjoy your weekend with your pack.</p>\n", "post_id": 1079, "location": false, "date": "04-13-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Therapy dog", "Dog", "sad", "Pets", "Anger", "Maryland"],

your size.\u00a0 You, so far, are the biggest dog I\u2019ve been fortunate and lucky enough to board, know, and love.\u00a0 You were impressive, to say the least. \u00a0As I got to know you, I realized that what was more impressive than your size was the fact that you were sweet, loving, docile, and so easy to fall in love with.</p>\n<p>Forgive me for not writing right away, but I was filled with anger and I did not think that that would have been the right time to write this letter to you.\u00a0 Why angry?\u00a0 Because you are gone, it is that simple.\u00a0 While dwelling in my anger, I remembered reading somewhere that the reason why a dog happens to be in our lives is to teach us the many things we are unable to learn from other humans, and that a dog\u2019s life is short because if it were to be long, we, humans, would not be able to cope with such a loss. \u00a0It actually made sense to me.</p>\n<p>Before I had that epiphany, I was just sad, period.\u00a0 At night, I could not stop thinking about you and so I started to cry.\u00a0 Cynthia saw me and comforted me and told me the following:\u00a0 \u201cDozer will be sorely missed, that is for sure,\u201d then she said, \u201cHe farted when we were sitting at the table.\u00a0 Didn\u2019t you smell it?\u201d I don\u2019t know why, but for some odd reason I just laughed my butt off.\u00a0 I truly needed that, but in all honesty, I did not smell your farts.\u00a0 Thank you for that.</p>\n<p>Cynthia, Alex and I are going to miss you dearly, and we hope the best to your pet parents while dealing with your loss.\u00a0 I am not going to say good-bye to you, but rather I\u2019ll see you later for I know we will see each other in the future.\u00a0 Until then, a big hug and kiss from all of us.</p>\n<p>Yours always,</p>\n<p>Marcela</p>\n", "post_id": 1089, "location": false, "date": "04-18-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Recreation", "Guard dog", "Dog", "Dogs

he is very affectionate and playful.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allmycaninecompanions.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/busy21.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1220\" alt=\"busy2\"

paw next to my hand.\u00a0 Could you believe the size of his paw?</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allmycaninecompanions.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/busy3.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large

Bingo.\u00a0 He is not playful, but he is an amazing dog.\u00a0 He reminds me of my Alex a lot, therefore I&#8217;d have to say that my opinion is one that is not truly fair but rather biased.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allmycaninecompanions.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/busy4.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1222\" alt=\"busy4\"

odd reason she warmed up to Bear pretty fast.\u00a0 Cute couple.</p>\n<p>Even though this was a pretty busy week, I enjoyed it because I got to see how much dogs differ from one another, and I got to spend time with them.\u00a0 I&#8217;d like to call them my peeps, but that is for humans.\u00a0 What word could I use to call them my peeps?\u00a0 What would you suggest?</p>\n", "post_id": 1217,

because the walks we take every day seem to be enough for her, and\u00a0because a couple of months ago she started to limp while we were walking.\u00a0 I took her to the vet and she was given medication she has to take every day plus a lot of rest for a couple of weeks.\u00a0 Now she is back to her usual self, but she&#8217;ll go for a follow-up with the vet next week.\u00a0 What I do, since a lot of dogs have never run next to a bike, is get Alex to jog next to the bike I am riding for 1 minute or less.\u00a0 Why?\u00a0 I want the other dogs to see what she is doing and\u00a0mimic that behavior.\u00a0 Now, should Alex run or walk?\u00a0 She should walk because she is a senior dog and she was already limping while walking with me.\u00a0 By the way, this is how Alex and Dexter looked on Saturday, after a good run early in the morning.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allmycaninecompanions.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/runorwalk2.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large

but Sarris\u00a0is also a younger dog.\u00a0 I got her to run/jog for about 10 minutes, and after that we walked home.\u00a0 She did not have a problem with the bike.\u00a0 Actually, she seemed to enjoy running alongside\u00a0me.\u00a0 Should you run or walk Sarris?\u00a0 Well, I think she should run 2 to 3 times a week and walk the rest of the week because she is an active\u00a0young dog.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allmycaninecompanions.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/runorwalk3.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1230\" alt=\"runorwalk3\"

&#8211; R, Dexter, Alex, and Sarris.\u00a0 They were all ready for a nap.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allmycaninecompanions.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/runorwalk4.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter

to the right, is about 2 1/2 years old and he is full of energy, therefore he can easily run every other day without a problem.\u00a0 His mom told me that he did not like bikes, so I was really surprised when after walking with him for 5 minutes he had no problem at all running alongside my bike.\u00a0 I was so happy and after a couple of minutes he tried to run fast, but I had to slow down because he is very strong and I did not want him to over do it.\u00a0 We kept up a pretty nice pace, but we did not go fast.\u00a0 Yes, Dexter should definitely run a few times a week.</p>\n<p>Every dog is different and if you decide to try going for a run with your dog, please make sure to consider the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Age, weight, breed, and health of the dog &#8211; If unsure, talk to the vet</li>\n<li>Weather &#8211; I go for a run early in the morning, 6am during the Summer</li>\n<li>Distance &#8211; Do not make your dog run for more than 5 &#8211; 10 minutes at the beginning and increase the time little by little</li>\n<li>At the beginning, try walking your dog next to the bike &#8211; Some dogs hate bikes</li>\n<li>Always, after every run, check his pads to make sure they are not damaged</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are just a few suggestions to consider before taking your dog for a run.\u00a0 Remember that going for a run with your dog is supposed to be enjoyable and good for both, you and your dog.\u00a0 What do you do with your dog to help him burn some energy?</p>\n", "post_id": 1227, "location": false, "date": "07-21-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features":

parents have told me the same about their dogs, but letting dogs stay out in the sun for too long is dangerous, therefore I limit the time we are out on the deck to no more than 5 minutes in the morning during the Summer.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allmycaninecompanions.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/moderation2.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1235\" alt=\"moderation2\"

to follow Alex\u00a0to dreamland, but Dexter, <del>between you and me </del>he thinks he is a guard dog, is still awake.</p>\n<p>Alex and Dexter love to sunbathe while Sarris only prefers to do it for a couple of minutes.\u00a0 By the way, never leave your dog/s unattended anywhere and that includes your deck regardless of the time of day or season of the year.</p>\n<p><a

while Alex and Dexter go to their bed.\u00a0 There are times when all 3 of them end up in the kitchen and those are the times when I am so glad that my kitchen is not small.\u00a0 Because our morning routine takes a while, I always tell pet parents that if they call me or text me I will return their inquiries after I am finished with our morning routine.</p>\n<p>Let your canine companions enjoy

new smells she encountered while walking in Annapolis.\u00a0 This is a great way to fulfill your dog&#8217;s need for exercise.</p>\n", "post_id": 1267, "location": false, "date": "08-20-2013",

mildly, and just like many pet parents we knew nothing about dogs so I went to the library and read as much as I could on dog training.\u00a0 I, then, realized that I needed to get Casey enrolled in an Obedience Class and find the right trainer for him.\u00a0 The first trainer did not work out because she had a very high pitch voice and Casey would get scared, so we tried a second trainer, Janet Bennett, and she was perfect for us.\u00a0 Casey got his first report card for completing Basic Obedience I on April, 27, 2002 and I was so happy that, only pet parents will be able to understand this, it trumped getting my MBA.\u00a0 Don\u2019t take me wrong, I was extremely happy when I got my MBA, but that first report card made me ecstatic.\u00a0 I worked so hard and so long with Casey and I enjoyed the classes so much that I took with Casey: Obedience I, Obedience II, and Canine Good Citizen with the same trainer, Janet Bennett.</p>\n<p><a

longer with Casey than Alex.</p>\n<p>After taking a total of four (4) classes with my dogs, were they perfect? \u00a0No, but they were certainly more manageable and we enjoyed having them.\u00a0 The point of training is, at least for me, to be able to enjoy, manage, and provide structure for your dog.\u00a0 Once you have taken your dog for some training, make sure that you incorporate that training into her everyday life/routine so there\u2019s no excuse like, \u201cI don\u2019t have time to train my dog.\u201d</p>\n<p><a

will be a nightmare.</li>\n<li>Ask your dog to sit so you can put on her collar and leash.\u00a0 Open the door with you exiting first, followed by your dog.</li>\n<li>Make sure the leash is loose and your dog is on your left side.\u00a0 If you prefer to use the right side, that is fine, but at the beginning you need to use the same side for consistency.</li>\n<li>Start walking with your dog next to you.\u00a0 If she starts getting ahead of you, at this point she is probably pulling you, walk the opposite way.</li>\n<li>Every time she pulls you go the opposite way.\u00a0 She&#8217;ll get the point after a couple of times.\u00a0 I did this with my first dog, Casey, and I got dizzy because a few times were more like a lot of times.\u00a0 Patience was my only weapon.</li>\n<li>If you get frustrated, and you will, please go back home and end the walk.\u00a0 The ability for a dog to learn diminishes when she is under stress.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a

reputable behaviorist or dog trainer on desensitizing him to whatever it\u00a0 is that is causing him to growl, nip, bite, etc.\u00a0 The examples I used to illustrate my point are that of dogs that are not aggressive, exhibiting symptoms that I&#8217;d consider mild, but I&#8217;d strongly recommend to consult a behaviorist or dog trainer to help you with these type of issues, and remember that what works for one dog may not necessarily work for another.</p>\n", "post_id": 1391, "location": false, "date": "11-08-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Recreation",

proper diet, message, and sunbathing, to name a few.\u00a0 I remember the article about sunbathing because Alex enjoys doing that, and according to what I read sunbathing is good for them because it gives them a, &#8220;healthy boost of sunshine into their systems.&#8221;\u00a0 If you want to read more about it, check out this website,\u00a0 <a

her to the vet for a consult, x-rays, blood work, etc., she was diagnosed with having an injury to the anterior cruciate ligament, ACL, also known as cranial cruciate ligament.\u00a0 According to what the vet told me and what I read, this is one of the most common injuries in dogs.\u00a0 I had no idea since Alex, although a senior dog, never had such an injury.</p>\n<p><a

The vet referred us to a surgeon, and the next day I made an appointment for them to see her and schedule her for surgery.\u00a0 Unlike other times when she starts eating in about 1/2\u00a0 a day, this time she did not want to eat at all for 3 days.\u00a0 We went back to the vet for an upset stomach, but I asked for them not to sedate her anymore.\u00a0 With the medication given to her for her tummy, she finally ate, but I was really frantic and was ready to take her to have surgery, but Cynthia said, &#8220;Let her recuperate first and then we&#8217;ll do whatever is best for her.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allmycaninecompanions.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/brace3.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1415\" alt=\"brace3\"

that it was best to start with the least intrusive way to address her injury.\u00a0 With that in mind, we did some research and ordered an A Track Dynamic Brace.\u00a0 We got it within 3 working days and it took us longer to measure Alex for the brace than it took Cynthia to put it on her.\u00a0 Before the brace, she walked on 3 legs, but as soon as she had the brace on she started to put weight on her injured leg, hind left leg, and I was amazed. She has a long, long way to go, but this is, at least for Alex, a good start.\u00a0 In a couple of weeks, when the knee gets better and stronger I&#8217;ll be looking into hydrotherapy and acupuncture.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allmycaninecompanions.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/brace4.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1416\" alt=\"brace4\"

minutes at a time about 4 to 5 times a day, and increase time little by little.\u00a0 She wears the brace during the day, but when is time to go to sleep, the brace is removed and Alex sleeps inside her kennel which she loves, but rarely ever uses in order to limit her movements.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allmycaninecompanions.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/img_6434.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter

the most inner part of the turkey that did not have any seasoning, and mixed it with her kibble, and you know what?\u00a0 That girl inhaled her food.\u00a0 By the way, do not feed your dog turkey, chicken, pork, etc., in large quantities.\u00a0 The only reason Alex got a nice helping of turkey is because I mix her kibble with human food on a regular basis, lately 1/2 kibble 1/2 human food so she is used to it and I always make sure that there is no seasoning added to her food.\u00a0 Alex, in the above picture, got inpatient and was leaving because Cynthia was taking too long to put the turkey away.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allmycaninecompanions.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/txs20135.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1423\" alt=\"txs20135\"

wanted to &#8220;help&#8221; her with this task.\u00a0 What a helpful child.\u00a0 Can you see how attentive she is?\u00a0 We had a great Thanksgiving because we were all toghether and we hope all of

looking at her, I remembered the last time, years ago, when I had to travel out of the US and leave her in a kennel facility, and how I told myself and Alex that that was the last time I&#8217;d do that.\u00a0 Please, do not misunderstand me, there are kennel facilities that are run by experienced, competent, dog loving individuals that do their very best to take care of the dogs they are entrusted with, but a kennel environment for many dogs can put a great amount of stress on them.\u00a0 Years ago, I was the manager of a PetsHotel and I can honestly say that the staff that worked alongside me truly loved dogs and did a great job caring for them, but I also realized that the majority of the dogs were stressed out so with that in mind I decided to quit that job and I started offering In Home Dog Boarding.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allmycaninecompanions.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/boarding3.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1428\" alt=\"boarding3\"

is a stress free environment, similar to the one they have at home.\u00a0 I&#8217;ve had dogs that had a variety of issues such as: separation anxiety, fear of being crated, incessant chewing, etc., and they all have done well staying with us.\u00a0 At the end of their stay I talk to the pet parents for a couple of minutes to let them know how their furry kid did and to mention anything unusual that I noticed about their doggie.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allmycaninecompanions.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/boarding4.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1429\" alt=\"boarding4\"

may look a little intimidating he is really a sweetheart.\u00a0 For the most part, I don&#8217;t crate dogs unless necessary, but, and this is something I do want to stress to all pet parents, a crate should be used as a tool for training your dog and never as punishment nor the answer to solve all your dog&#8217;s problems or issues.</p>\n<p><a

about a shelter for dogs run differently than the ones here in the US.\u00a0 This shelter outside of Tehran allows dogs to live freely with each other and they are even able to eat next to each other.\u00a0 She posted some amazing pictures and it really made me think about what she said about dogs being social animals.\u00a0 I am a firm believer that we all can learn from one another, and perhaps this shelter in such a far away place can teach us all a thing or two.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allmycaninecompanions.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/boarding6.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter

out with me, I always ask pet parents to text me an hour prior to picking up their furry kid in order to have their doggie ready and to make sure that all the other dogs will not disturb us when they get to my place.</p>\n<p>Whatever your choice for your dog may be, when it comes to boarding, my advice would be to ask a lot of questions, ask to see where your dog will be staying, do a search and see what comments are posted about this facility or pet sitter, and weigh all your options before making your decision.\u00a0 Always remember that you are your dog&#8217;s advocate and that if you are not comfortable with a particular place or person, follow your gut and keep looking.</p>\n", "post_id": 1425, "location": false, "date": "12-08-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}},

wants to run towards me at full speed.\u00a0 I don&#8217;t ask her to sit anymore for I fear it may hurt or cause her pain, but she is able to do a lot of other things without discomfort.</p>\n<p>Have

people, I make a list of my new year&#8217;s resolution to tackle, but this year, surprisingly even to me, I failed to do so.\u00a0 Instead, I decided to do things I&#8217;ve been meaning to do for a while and unlike past years, 2014, although today is only January 4th, is proving to be quite fulfilling.\u00a0 The first thing I addressed was continuing with Alex&#8217;s training and small

kill it like I&#8217;ve done in the past.\u00a0 With that in mind, Cynthia gave me a beautiful white Orchid for my birthday that I named Snowflake.\u00a0 Yes, I name them because in my mind it makes me more responsible, and between you and me, I think its working.\u00a0 A week later, we went and got another Orchid, the one featured in the above picture, that I named Lilly.\u00a0 A month has gone

away because she seemed afraid of a lot of things and I did not want to frighten her.\u00a0 To our surprise she slept soundly, actually she snored, and ate all her dinner last night, followed by a breakfast I could have sworn she inhaled this morning.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d venture to say that this is a nice way to start 2014, don&#8217;t you think?\u00a0 Have a great weekend.</p>\n", "post_id":

information about her and a progress report:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>DOB: 11/24/2010</li>\n<li>Breed: Pit Bull Mix</li>\n<li>She is extremely smart and knows how to sit, wait/stay, go to bed, and come</li>\n<li>She&#8217;s crate-trained and housebroken.\u00a0 No accidents at all</li>\n<li>Amazingly sweet with people and all she wants is to be with you and be petted all day if you have the time</li>\n<li>Still working on walking on a loose leash.\u00a0 Very good progress so far</li>\n<li>She shaked uncontrollably when I was about to feed her and Alex.\u00a0 Food seems to stress her out.\u00a0 Now she still shakes, but less than before and she is able to wait rather than pace around the kitchen until I have their food ready</li>\n<li>Bella responds best when the correction is done with your voice.\u00a0 Harsh corrections, rough handling, popping of leash, etc., are not recommended for her.\u00a0 She is a big strong girl, but<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> she is very</span> <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">sensitive</span>.\u00a0 Although your voice needs to mean business it has to be done without a harsh tone otherwise she&#8217;ll shut down completely</li>\n<li>She is not suitable for a first-time pet parent</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"http://allmycaninecompanions.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/bella3.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large

for you to see how funny she looks when she does that.\u00a0 We are not sure yet if she is ok with other dogs.\u00a0 At the shelter, she was a favorite with a lot of the volunteers and she played very nice with other dogs, but we have to see how she does when living with other dogs in a home environment.\u00a0 We&#8217;ll find out in a few days.</p>\n<p><a

the brace is removed at night-time she does not limp, but we don&#8217;t want to push it so she&#8217;ll continue with bed rest and short walks for a while longer.</p>\n<p>To foster a shelter dog is a

please remember that not all foster dogs may be suitable for your home just like not all dogs would be a good fit for your family.</p>\n<p>If you are interested in adopting Bella, this is the information you will need to apply for her:\u00a0 She is with BARCS, ID# A21561474.\u00a0 Wish us luck and let&#8217;s hope this horrible weather changes soon.\u00a0 Have a great weekend.</p>\n",

to my pack.</p>\n<p>Cynthia, Alex, Bella, and I went for a walk together.\u00a0 At the beginning of the walk, Alex was on my left side while Bella was on Cynthia&#8217;s right side.\u00a0 We stopped for a couple of minutes so they can do their business, but they were not allowed to interact with each other yet.\u00a0 Because Alex cannot walk a lot we had to stop after we walked for a little while to give them an opportunity to sniff each other.\u00a0 Bella&#8217;s body language was relaxed and curious.\u00a0 So far so good.</p>\n<p><a

was able to interact with Alex.\u00a0 What did I realize?\u00a0 Bella has no doggie manners.\u00a0 She almost stepped on Alex a few times.\u00a0 What did Alex do?\u00a0 Nothing.\u00a0 And that is why Alex is perfect for me and for what I do which is board, train, and work on behavioral issues many dogs have.\u00a0 After a couple of minutes, we brushed their hair and wiped their paws and proceeded to go inside.</p>\n<p>Bella&#8217;s body language indoors changed.\u00a0 She became tensed and zeroed in on Alex.\u00a0 I redirected that behavior by getting her attention and she was fine.</p>\n<p><a

outside was great.\u00a0 She did a play bow inviting Alex to play</li>\n<li>Once inside, her body language became tense and on guard.\u00a0 She lowered her head, body was tense, stared at Alex and looked ready to go for her</li>\n<li>Even though I was not crazy about her body language indoors, Bella responded well or I should say amazingly well to voice corrections and commands</li>\n<li>Although she did great while playing with other dogs at the shelter, now she has to learn to live in peace with other dogs in a home environment</li>\n<li>She has to learn doggie manners.\u00a0 She cannot step over other dogs</li>\n<li>On the deck, Bella showed signs of stress, pacing back and forth, but she relaxed after a few minutes when she saw Alex sunbathing</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is just the beginning for Bella.\u00a0 She has a long way to go and this is why a shelter dog, in my opinion, has a better chance to find her forever home when she has been fostered for a while.\u00a0 Why?\u00a0 Living in a home environment teaches her how to be a member of a pack and that is something that she cannot learn in a shelter.\u00a0 I have great admiration for the people who work in shelters.\u00a0 They do an amazing job, and they can always use our help whether this comes in the form of donations, volunteer time, fostering dogs, etc.\u00a0

neighborhood.\u00a0 Bella&#8217;s body language was that of a dog in shock of being outside.\u00a0 More details in another post.\u00a0 Anyway, as time went by, Bella stopped staring and wanting to go

the point of doing this?\u00a0 I want Bella to get used to just relaxing around other dogs and I also wanted to observe her body language towards Alex and Dexter, and the squirrels around our backyard

nothing.\u00a0 I know this may sound ridiculous to some people, but I wanted to cry.\u00a0 Why?\u00a0 This is progress for Bella, being able to get along with other dogs indoors, and I was over the moon.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><a href=\"http://allmycaninecompanions.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/getalong5.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1490\" alt=\"getalong5\"

did to get her to this point?\u00a0 No, it was a combination of many things such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Exercise &#8211; a mix of walks and runs twice a day</li>\n<li>Feeding &#8211; once she is finished eating, she is to wait patiently until all the other dogs finish their meal and then all of them go to bed to relax and take a nap</li>\n<li>Sleeping &#8211; she sleeps in her crate after we give her some loving</li>\n<li>At home &#8211; she is not allowed to roam around the house on her own.\u00a0 She is either with Cynthia or I so we can monitor her body language and interaction with other dogs</li>\n<li>Outside &#8211; we are working on getting her to walk properly, and she is doing better.\u00a0 Her body language during our walks went from afraid to more relaxed as time went by, although squirrels still drive her nuts</li>\n<li>Structure &#8211; she gets all the love she can handle, but she must earn it.\u00a0 She has to sit before she gets anything, she has to wait before going out the door, and so much more</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"http://allmycaninecompanions.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/getalong6.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1491\"

close to her.\u00a0 For those pet parents and foster parents that just got a new dog to add to their pack, my advice would be to do the following: have patience, appreciate the progress your dogs are making regardless of how small they may seem, do not leave them unattended, provide structure for them, exercise them, and work on teaching them basic training and good manners.\u00a0 Understand this though, your dog will not change overnight.\u00a0 You will see progress and change in your dog as time goes by, so arm yourself with a lot of patience and do not feel discourage when there are setbacks, and there will be set backs.\u00a0 Our foster furry kid, Bella, is an amazing girl and little by little we are starting to see a more relaxed and balanced doggie.\u00a0 Enjoy your holiday with your furry children.</p>\n", "post_id": 1485, "location": false, "date": "01-20-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["molar", "foster dog", "brush teeth", "dental care",

teeth.\u00a0 At the beginning, all I did was put a bit of doggie toothpaste on a toothbrush so she could get used to it.\u00a0 As days went by, I was able to start brushing her teeth followed by a snack, which she loved.\u00a0 Between you and me, I think she just let me brush her teeth for the treat.\u00a0 Smart girl!</p>\n<p>A couple of days ago, I was finally able to brush her molars and I could not believe what I saw.\u00a0 There was a black hole not on the tooth, but rather on the gums.\u00a0 I had never seen anything like that before so I contacted BARCS right away and I took Bella to their vet so he can check her out.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allmycaninecompanions.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/brush1.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1501\" alt=\"brush1\" src=\"https://allmycaninecompanions.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/brush1.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=682\"   /></a>I told the vet that she had a black hole on both sides/gums, and that although her breath was not as stinky as before we could still smell something funky.\u00a0 He would have had to sedate her to see this, so I suggested to him that Cynthia and I hold Bella and show him what we were talking about.\u00a0 We did so and he gave Bella antibiotics and a referral to another vet with experience in this sort of problem.</p>\n<p>Tomorrow, Wednesday, we&#8217;ll be dropping Bella off at the vet we were referred to so he/she can take care of Bella&#8217;s teeth.</p>\n<p>And, the above picture is why it is extremely important that you brush your furry kid&#8217;s teeth.\u00a0 I brush Alex&#8217;s teeth almost every night, I am not a perfect pet parent, and there are nights when I am too lazy or I just forget, but 9 out of 10 times she gets her teeth brushed and I ask Cynthia, at least once a month, to check her mouth since she is a dental hygienist.\u00a0 The first time I asked her to do that, she just laughed and looked a little puzzled.\u00a0 Right now checking Alex&#8217;s teeth and gums is just something she does at least once a month for our girl.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allmycaninecompanions.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/brush3.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large

only had a dental cleaning once.\u00a0 That, I think, is pretty good.\u00a0 If you do not brush your furry kid&#8217;s teeth, bacteria will grow and because of it organs such as her heart, kidney, and liver can be affected.\u00a0 Please, take a couple of minutes every night and brush her teeth.\u00a0 Cynthia knows a lot about it since she is a dental hygienist and she uses a lot of terminology that honestly speaking sounds like another language to me, but so far what I gathered from what she tells me is that plaque grows faster at night-time when we produce less saliva and that is why she is really adamant about having everybody brush their teeth before going to bed.</p>\n", "post_id": 1499, "location": false, "date": "01-28-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags":

part we were able to see were the black holes on her gums, but once she was sedated they found that a stick was pushing her teeth out-of-place.\u00a0 After we picked Bella up from the vet, we passed by BARCS to pick up her meds and then we headed back home.\u00a0 You&#8217;d think she&#8217;d be a little mellow, but boy she was still full of energy, but for that evening she was fed and kept apart

surprise she did great.\u00a0 Although everything around her was new, dogs, people, location, etc., she was able to focus and did almost every exercise right.\u00a0 She also met other people including children and got a couple of compliments from the trainer for doing such a good job.\u00a0 To say that I was over the moon would be an understatement.</p>\n<p>Anyway, Bella and I were given homework to do so we&#8217;ll be busy working on the following: recall, sit, down, push-ups, and one trick that I forgot what it was called, sorry about that.\u00a0 Have a great weekend.</p>\n", "post_id":

changed a lot would be an understatement so I&#8217;d like to share her progress with you and hope to get some feedback.</p>\n<p>Walking &#8211; She did not know how to walk.\u00a0 She pulled every which way, and she was so bad at it that while attempting to walk her a day when we had a lot of snow on the ground, I ended up flat on my back while holding on for dear life to her leash and at that moment I said, &#8220;That&#8217;s it, I give up on this dog.&#8221;\u00a0 Yes, I actually said that.\u00a0 I never had a dog be that bad at walking.\u00a0 That day while talking to my girlfriend, Cynthia, she mentioned me flat on the white snow while dressed in dark clothes and you know what we did?\u00a0 We laughed like crazy.\u00a0 Nowadays, Bella, for the most part, walks next to us.\u00a0 That is progress:-)</p>\n<p>Feeding &#8211; While I put their food together, at the beginning, Cynthia had to put a leash and collar to restrain her from going to the other dog&#8217;s area while they were still eating.\u00a0 Bella also used to make this grunting/piggy noises that would start as soon as she saw me take our their dishes.\u00a0 What about now?\u00a0 She still makes those funny noises, but not until she hears the kibble going in her little dish, and we restrain her by using voice commands.</p>\n<p>Pacing &#8211; Even after we took her out for a walk, she would pace in a frantic way.\u00a0 She had a lot of anxiety and pent-up energy in her.\u00a0 Now she seems to be much more relaxed and comfortable, and the amount and intensity of her pacing has greatly decreased. I love to see her walk around the house relaxed and content.</p>\n<p>Training &#8211; Bella is attending a Basic Training class that will last 5 weeks, and to be really honest, I thought she was going to be the worst student ever.\u00a0 Sorry, but that is how I really felt, but you know what?\u00a0 On our first class, last Saturday, she did great.\u00a0 She got almost all the commands correct, received compliments from one of the trainers, interacted well with people and one child.\u00a0 I was so proud of her.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allmycaninecompanions.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/1month2.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-1517\" alt=\"1month2\" src=\"https://allmycaninecompanions.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/1month2.jpg?w=500&#038;h=598\" width=\"500\" height=\"598\" /></a>Doggie manners &#8211; She almost stepped over Alex when they were sunbathing on the deck.\u00a0 Right now she is more aware of her surroundings, but she still needs some fine tuning in this area.\u00a0 She also, once, took a Nylabone from Alex&#8217;s mouth.\u00a0 Alex just looked at me like, &#8220;What was that?&#8221;\u00a0 I don&#8217;t allow Bella to do that because that can cause a fight.</p>\n<p>I will probably start taking her to BARCS adoption events in the near future.\u00a0 With that in mind, let me share this with you.\u00a0 A student from Animal Behavior College told me that she volunteered for an adoption event for, I forgot the name of the organization, sorry, and the dog she was handling after a couple of hours made her hands red and raw from pulling.\u00a0 That is something I want to avoid with Bella.\u00a0 When she is ready to go to an adoption event, I want people to see the amazing girl she really is and not walk away because all they see is a hyperactive, crazy, out of control dog.\u00a0 I will not set her up to fail.\u00a0 It is up to Cynthia, Alex, and I to do the best that we can to get her ready to go to her forever home, but not until she is ready.</p>\n<p>If I were asked, how&#8217;s it living with a foster dog?\u00a0 I&#8217;d reply, &#8220;You will never have a dull moment, and you&#8217;ll have plenty of laughter, lessons learned, tears shed, frustration, and moments when you question your own sanity for embarking in such a difficult, arduous, sometimes, heartbreaking journey, but this was something I have wanted to do for a long time, and I am fortunate enough to be able to do it now.&#8221;\u00a0 So, the succinct answer to your question would be, &#8220;Challenging, heartbreaking, and rewarding.&#8221;\u00a0 I know, I know.\u00a0 I could have started with that.\u00a0 Have a great week.</p>\n", "post_id": 1515, "location": false, "date": "02-03-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["foster dog", "run", "pent-up energy", "backpack", "hyperactive dog", "walk", "dogs"], "text": "<div id=\"attachment_1520\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://allmycaninecompanions.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/backpack1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1520\" alt=\"Alex to Bella, &quot;I know you are shy, but you'll get used to them taking pictures all the time.

sanity, I had to make sure that Alex walked, 1 &#8211; 1 1/2 hour twice a day, ran, twice a week, and do some training.\u00a0 Because of her injury, Alex now walks around 20 minutes once or twice a day when the weather is not too cold, but just when I thought I was about to get a break, Bella joined our family.</p>\n<p>As you can see in the picture, Bella, like many siblings, gets her hand me downs from Alex which includes a backpack.\u00a0 Why do I use a backpack?\u00a0 For some dogs like Bella, a regular walk will just not do, therefore adding a backpack can give her a job to do and she will be tired by the time we get home.</p>\n<p>Some dogs have to be eased into wearing a backpack.\u00a0 You can use treats to do that.\u00a0 Let her wear it for a couple of minutes while rewarding her.\u00a0 With Alex and Bella, it seemed like they&#8217;ve done this all their life.\u00a0 Go figure.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allmycaninecompanions.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/backpack2.jpg\"><img

backpack?\u00a0 In order to make it even, I put the same amount of weigh on each side.\u00a0 Do Not make your dog wear a backpack while she is running.\u00a0 Some people put a bottle of water, wipes, keys, etc., in the backpack so the dog is really working by carrying her pet parents things.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allmycaninecompanions.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/backpack3.jpg\"><img

Bella wear a backpack?\u00a0 A tired, relaxed dog, as you can see in the above picture.\u00a0 If you happen to have a high-energy dog like Bella, you need to drain that energy and fulfill her needs in order to enjoy her company rather than having a dog that can easily drive you crazy and frustrate you beyond words.\u00a0 What do you do with your dog to drain his/her energy?</p>\n", "post_id": 1519,

the house</li>\n<li>She is still on bed rest, and she is not allowed to run up and down the stairs which she still loves to do</li>\n<li>She does not wear the brace when she goes to bed.\u00a0 I put a heating pad around her injured leg and back when is time to go to sleep</li>\n<li>In the morning, once she sees one of us get up, to our amazement and delight, she walks without limping and no brace for a couple of minutes</li>\n<li>She seems to have gained some of the flexibility and agility she had before she got injured</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a

brace were the price, $386.75 including shipping, and having to pay about $120 for someone to take the measurements for the brace.\u00a0 I did not pay for the latter because Cynthia took the measurements, but a lot of people, for what I read online, had difficulty with this part so the total for them would have been a little over $500.</p>\n<p>Was it worth it for Alex?\u00a0 Yes, it was.\u00a0 I am hoping that in a couple of months from now she&#8217;ll be only wearing that brace once in a while.</p>\n", "post_id": 1525, "location": false, "date": "02-09-2014", "mentions": [],

today.\u00a0 It does not mean she is done, but she has improved a lot.\u00a0 In the near future, when the weather gets better, I am going to start taking her to walk in different areas so she can be

This is why I have started to write a blog for Cefni.\u00a0 The page is in its early stages but will include top tips about keeping your dog happy and healthy, interesting snippets of information for fact junkies and most importantly regular updates on dogs that are currently look for homes. All we need you to do is follow the blog and share it with as many people as you can; post it on facebook, email it to all your friends or like Alex, ping me a comment and give me a chance to reach your blog readers with posts like this.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If you are really passionate about joining our ranks there are many ways you can get involved from fostering a dog while we look for its forever home, to designing products and merchandise we can sell to raise charity funds.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For more information please visit my blog:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u00a0<a href=\"http://cefnigermanshepherdrescue.wordpress.com/how-can-you-get-involved/\">http://cefnigermanshepherdrescue.wordpress.com/how-can-you-get-involved/</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">To finish I\u2019d like to tell you a few of our success stories. Duke&#8217;s pet parent, contacted Cefni because she was having major issues with him and was looking for Duke to be rehomed. German Shepherds are amazing creatures but without the correct guidance they are very often misunderstood. Duke&#8217;s owner agreed to join Cefni training classes with Duke while we looked for a new home for him, after some months training she decided to keep Duke at her home forever. This story illustrates one of the many ways Cefni can help German Shepherds stay in happy family homes<b>. </b></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong><span lang=\"EN-GB\" style=\"font-family:'Calibri', 'sans-serif';font-weight:normal;\">Max came to us at just three years old, he was very adorable and hug, a big baby, everyone who came into contact with him instantly fell in love. However months later he was still in our care, this can happen when a dog is very large. Sometimes, like Max, dogs stay with us for many months out of no fault of their own. For this reason we try to put dogs in foster homes while we look for their permanent home, even the best kennels can be very stressful, if prolonged this can physiologically damage even the calmest dog. In the end Max charmed his way into the heart of his forever owner who now believes bigger is always better even when you\u2019re talking about a large breed like German Shepherds.

with us.\u00a0 The changes I see in her and the continuous progress she makes every day makes us all happy and hopeful that one day she&#8217;ll find her forever home.\u00a0 Here&#8217;s a progress report on Bella:</p>\n<p>Walking &#8211; On my last post, she was walking next to us, for the most part.\u00a0 Nowadays when I walk her, and this is no lie, I truly enjoy our time together.\u00a0 She walks beautifully, but fast like I do which I love.\u00a0 With Cynthia, this is weird since she is the one that taught her how to walk properly, she tends to get a little ahead of her during their walks.\u00a0 Overall, I&#8217;d say better than last month.</p>\n<p>Feeding &#8211; She still makes those funny sounds like a piggy, bird, and who knows what else, but less than a month ago.</p>\n<p>Pacing &#8211; She paces when she sees either Cynthia or I coming back home.\u00a0 Now the pacing seems to be more out of happiness than anxiety.\u00a0 In general, her pacing is less than before, and when she does it we stop her and ask her to sit or shake hands so she can snap out of it.</p>\n<p>Training &#8211; Bella got her Basic Obedience completed on 3/1/14.\u00a0 I am hoping to get her enrolled in another class in the near future.</p>\n<p>Doggie manners &#8211; Bella is a little more careful and aware of her surroundings unlike before when she would step over Alex.\u00a0 Progress!</p>\n<p>We took her to an adoption event a couple of weeks ago, and she did great and got an application approved, but the prospective pet parents changed their mind due to their living arrangements.\u00a0 I&#8217;ll be taking her soon to another adoption event so she can get some exposure and perhaps her forever home, but also this would give her an opportunity to meet more people and socialize with them.</p>\n", "post_id": 1567, "location": false, "date": "03-08-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["love", "Cooking", "Dog", "loyalty", "pit bull", "life

canine companion for almost 12 years, and you know what?\u00a0 I&#8217;ve been very lucky to have her in my life.\u00a0 Will said that Eko is his anchor.\u00a0 Well, Alex is the one being that finally

feeding your dog human food and have any questions about it, please talk to your vet or better, to a holistic vet.</p>\n<p>Tonight, for Alex and Bella&#8217;s dinner, I cooked a stir-fry using the

Pukka&#8217;s Promise by Ted Kerasote, and he provides excellent information regarding what goes in the kibble many of us, pet parents, buy and feed our dogs.\u00a0 Because of it, I started to feed Alex and Bella a mix of human food and kibble.\u00a0 Again, I started by adding very small quantities in order to avoid upsetting their tummies.\u00a0 Right now they are both eating twice a day: 1/2 cup of kibble + 1 cup of human food.</p>\n<p>Do you know what I&#8217;ve noticed now that they are eating more human food than kibble?</p>\n<p>Alex &#8211; My Picky Eater</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Her appetite in the morning has opened up</li>\n<li>Her mobility and flexibility has increased a great deal.\u00a0 So much so, that now she walks next to me rather than lagging behind</li>\n<li>She used to do #2 up to 3 times a day and it was smelly.\u00a0 Now she does #2 once or twice a day and the smell is minimal.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a

smell</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This, human food and kibble, may not be for all dogs.\u00a0 I had a friend whose dog became quite ill if he ate any human food, even if it was only a bit of it.\u00a0 If you have questions, please ask a holistic vet and transition your dog slowly to any new food.\u00a0 Before I forget, I also rotate the kind of kibble I feed them every couple of months.\u00a0 If you have any recipes, I am always on the look out for new ones, you&#8217;d like to share with us, please do so.</p>\n", "post_id": 1611, "location": false, "date": "03-30-2014", "mentions": [],

affectionate, strong, challenging dog.\u00a0 In other words, perfect for us.\u00a0 Cynthia fell in love with Bella from the beginning, but to be quite honest, it did take me a while to really feel a bond with her.\u00a0 When did this happen?\u00a0 Once I started to train her.\u00a0 Training a dog is work for both the dog and the handler, so for those that have never trained a dog, let me tell you

mornings only.</li>\n<li>Later on, she used the backpack only on Mon., Wed., and Fri.</li>\n<li>Nowadays, she only wears it when I see that she has way too much energy.\u00a0 Maybe once a

it.\u00a0 Years ago, Cynthia and I took a class in college and our instructor called us, the dynamic duo, and you know what?\u00a0 I think he was right because we have always relied on each other, and this was one time when I truly needed her support and advice.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a little update on Alex:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Walks &#8211; She still wears the brace during our walks, but her speed and flexibility has greatly increased overtime.\u00a0 She does not wear the brace at home.\u00a0 Alex is walking longer than before, about 25 minutes once or twice a day.\u00a0 But the next day, just to be on the safe side, she takes shorter walks so she does not over do it.</li>\n<li>Rest &#8211; She sleeps a lot, she is almost 12 years old, but even at home she is more active.\u00a0 One thing we do not allow her to do at all is run up and down the stairs like she used to do before.\u00a0 Alex is probably thinking, &#8220;Mom you are a party pooper.&#8221;</li>\n<li>Diet &#8211; Since I started to feed her more human food than kibble, Alex&#8217;s appetite not only opened up, I love that, but she has not skipped a meal once.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a

also, little by little, trying different spices to help her arthritis.\u00a0 I can&#8217;t complain.\u00a0 My girl is doing fine and she is still active at almost 12 years of age.

Alex.\u00a0 Manners is something dogs can learn from one another, and I&#8217;ve been lucky to have Alex, a very laid-back, balanced pit mix, help other dogs accomplish that.</p>\n<p>Is manners something you can teach a dog overnight?\u00a0 No.\u00a0 There are many factors that need to be present and put into play in order to have a well-mannered dog and these are just a few: patience, structure, exercise, discipline, commitment, consistency, love, and a balanced dog like Alex.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allmycaninecompanions.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/gdmanners2.jpg\"><img

pet parent.</p>\n<p>Also, please don&#8217;t expect your dog to learn manners from another dog in a couple of hours, days, weeks, etc.\u00a0 Why?\u00a0 Dogs are individuals, as I mentioned on a previous post, and they learn at their own pace.\u00a0 Bella, our foster failure, has made amazing progress, but that took time and a ton of patience.\u00a0 There is still a lot more I need to work on

order to get them used to different things.\u00a0 Once we started working on the deck, they fell asleep in the kitchen by the sliding doors.\u00a0 What does that teach them?\u00a0 Self-control.\u00a0 Training your dog should be part of your every day life, and this is a perfect example of that.\u00a0 How does your canine companion help you tackle chores?\u00a0 Have a great Sunday!</p>\n",

ground because she did not know how to walk properly and because she was afraid of everything.\u00a0 I had to start desensitizing her so I, little by little, took her to new places to experience things such as bikes, motorcycles, people, etc.\u00a0 I started by getting her\u00a0 accustomed to low-level stimulus, and slowly, very slowly, increased its intensity.\u00a0 Our walks, at the beginning, were in our neighborhood for the most part, but since she seemed very comfortable in that environment I took her to Johns Hopkins Rd. in Crofton, MD because this is a busy street.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://allmycaninecompanions.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/jhr2.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1715\"

fears and he is prevented from fighting and/or fleeing &#8211; and for some dogs this method works, but not for others, like Bella.\u00a0 When we took her to Baltimore for an adoption event months ago, she lost it.\u00a0 It was so bad that when we got home she had diarrhea.\u00a0 As you can see, flooding was not for Bella.</p>\n<p><a

did she do?\u00a0 Great, in my opinion.\u00a0 She only barked once at a girl who got pretty close to our car, but she stopped within seconds.\u00a0 What did I learn?\u00a0 That what I must have in

because the weather is warm, I&#8217;ve encountered a lot of people during our walks asking me about Alex&#8217;s brace, and I am more than happy to stop for a couple of minutes and chat with them.\u00a0 Do you know what I found surprising?\u00a0 Every single pet parent that asked me about Alex&#8217;s brace told me the same thing, &#8220;I thought that the only option for an ACL injury was surgery,&#8221; to what I responded, &#8220;No, that is not the only option&#8221;.\u00a0 By the way, I do not get any monetary compensation from WoundWear Inc., what I like to do is talk about the products I buy for Alex and Bella and give you my poin of view, a consumer&#8217;s point of view.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a

been asked:</p>\n<p>What is your dog wearing?\u00a0 Is it a brace?\u00a0 Is she injured?\u00a0 Alex is wearing a brace and yes she injured her ACL.</p>\n<p>My dog had an ACL injury too, but I did not know about this brace.\u00a0 How did you find out about it?\u00a0 I did some research and read a lot of comments regarding this brace.</p>\n<p>Does she wear it all the time?\u00a0 The first few months, she wore it all the time, except when she went to bed.\u00a0 As time went by, once I saw that she was putting pressure on the injured leg, she only wore it when we went out.</p>\n<p>Why didn&#8217;t you opt for surgery?\u00a0 Alex is 12 years old, and because of her age I wanted to find out a less intrusive way of dealing with her injury.</p>\n<p>How much bed rest did she have?\u00a0 At the beginning, a lot.\u00a0 She only got up to eat, drink water, and do her business outside.\u00a0 Some people use a crate, but Alex loves to sleep so I did not have to do that.\u00a0 Currently, she walks twice a day for about 20-30 minutes, but when I see that she is starting to slow down during our walks I make the walks shorter for a day or two.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a

more questions I get asked, but this post would be too long to mention all of them, therefore, what I&#8217;d suggest to all pet parents when they have a canine kid with an ACL injury is to ask a lot of questions to the vet.\u00a0 If you are not happy with his answers, talk to different vets, including those that practice holistic medice and do some research.\u00a0 The more information you have the better equipped you&#8217;ll be to make a decision for your canine companion.\u00a0 Remember this: you are your dog&#8217;s best advocate,</p>\n", "post_id": 1726, "location": false, "date":

that I am a little bothered.\u00a0 No, let me rephrase that, I am angry.\u00a0 Why?\u00a0 I had a guy get quite bothered because I did not allow him to pet Bella.\u00a0 I was walking with Bella in a brand new area for her, and this man came straight at her, looking directly at her, saying in a high pitch voice, &#8220;Oh, you are so cute&#8221;.\u00a0 He did not have the common sense and yes, manners, to ask me if it was ok to pet Bella.\u00a0 At the beginning, I did not get angry at him since I know a lot of people even pet parents don&#8217;t know how to properly greet a dog so I told him, &#8220;No, please do not approach her.\u00a0 I am still training her and she seems to be a little bit sensitive towards men.\u00a0 Thanks.&#8221;\u00a0 He stopped and walked away quite unhappy.\u00a0 I saw this man again about 10 minutes later and I said, &#8220;Hi.&#8221;\u00a0 He made a face as if bothered.\u00a0</p>\n<p><a

anybody to approach my dogs, or those I am taking care of, unless I am 100% comfortable with that interaction and the dog I am handling is relaxed.\u00a0 Just like we humans are supposed to have manners, that man certainly did not since he did not ask me if he could pet Bella, dogs also have to have manners.\u00a0 This is what he did wrong, what he should have done instead, and why I said no to him.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>He came straight at her.\u00a0 Being approached in this manner only meant that he was challenging Bella.\u00a0 In other words, he was looking for a fight.\u00a0 He should have come from the side, either left or right.</li>\n<li>He looked straight at her.\u00a0 Another red flag.\u00a0 Direct eye contact is another way dogs challenge one another.\u00a0 Glancing at her would have been more appropriate and polite.\u00a0 Stress on the word <strong>Polite</strong>.</li>\n<li>He did not ask me if he could pet Bella.\u00a0 <strong>That is rude in our world.</strong>\u00a0 How would he like it if some stranger went up to him and touched him?\u00a0 This one I&#8217;d like to firmly stress, please <em><strong>ask the pet parent if you can pet his dog before you do it</strong></em>.\u00a0</li>\n<li>High pitch voice.\u00a0 That only created excitement and a nervous dog like Bella can easily have reacted by barking, hiding, shaking, etc.\u00a0 He should have used his usual voice and talk to<strong> me</strong> and not Bella.</li>\n<li>Because of all the above mentioned, the first word out of my mouth was, &#8220;No&#8221; when he tried to approach Bella.\u00a0 That stopped this rude man on his tracks.\u00a0</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"https://allmycaninecompanions.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/manners3.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-1732 aligncenter\"

wears her name well, but regardless of how cute a dog may be, you need to have the pet parent&#8217;s ok <strong>before</strong> you pet her dog.\u00a0 A lot of bites could be prevented if we, humans, learned how to properly introduce ourselves to a new dog.\u00a0 Please, let&#8217;s have manners, both in our canine companion&#8217;s world and ours as well.\u00a0 Enjoy your weekend.</p>\n",

As time went by, our home became a second home for Bailey, and although I was the one that walked and fed her the most, Bailey\u2019s heart belonged to Cynthia. Every morning they had a routine: Cynthia would sit on the floor and Bailey would sit on her lap; Cynthia would then scoop her up in her arms like a baby while Bailey looked delighted with such show of affection; and finally, Cynthia would whisper sweet nothings to her. This love fest would last 5, 10, 15 minutes. Sometimes I had to tell Cynthia, \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go. They need to take a walk and do their business.\u201d Cynthia\u2019s heart, as it was clear to me, belonged to Bailey. Every time we have a dog staying with us, the dog chooses one of us, and Bailey chose Cynthia. It was beautiful to see them on the floor oblivious to everything around them because they were doing their \u201clove fest routine.\u201d</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"https://allmycaninecompanions.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/cubailey2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-1741\" src=\"https://allmycaninecompanions.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/cubailey2.jpg?w=493&#038;h=439\" alt=\"cuBailey2\" width=\"493\" height=\"439\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Time went by, and on January 2012 Bailey and her parents moved to California. On her last visit with us, we went to the beach and Cynthia took a lot of pictures of both Bailey and Alex. The dictionary should have under the definition of happy the above picture of Bailey. That picture to me, from the very first time I saw it, showed what happy should look like.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Although I knew Bailey was leaving, what surprised me was how this affected me for although I did love her, I never knew how much. When I lost my aunt Maria to liver cancer in 2007 I was sad and anxious and I hated feeling like that. Bailey\u2019s departure made me feel that way again and that night I had a hard time falling asleep. Bailey\u2019s mom started a blog, and once a week I would take a look at it always hoping that I could see pictures of Bailey. A couple of months ago, I started to get a little concerned when I did not see any new posts since December of last year. I told Cynthia, \u201cI think something is going on. I hope they\u2019re ok.\u201d I wanted to contact them, but I felt it would be inappropriate and intrusive so I just kept looking at Cara\u2019s blog, Bailey\u2019s mom, every week and wishing that soon she\u2019d post something.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1742\" style=\"width: 463px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://allmycaninecompanions.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/cubaiely3.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-1742\" src=\"https://allmycaninecompanions.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/cubaiely3.jpg?w=453&#038;h=534\" alt=\"Bailey's best friend, Snickers.\" width=\"453\" height=\"534\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Bailey&#8217;s best friend, Snickers.</p></div>\n<p>Then, on March 23rd of this year I received an e-mail from Ryan, Bailey\u2019s dad, letting us know that Bailey had a form of bone marrow cancer and she was to be put down the next day. Ryan told me that they did everything they could, but you know what? I already knew that. Bailey was not only deeply loved by her parents, but also well cared for since they were willing to drive all the way from Arlington, VA to Odenton, MD to drop off or pick up Bailey when they had to travel. For those that are not familiar with this area that is a trip of about 40 minutes without traffic, and up to 2 hours when you hit traffic.</p>\n<p>Ryan also asked in his e-mail if we wanted to see Bailey one last time via Skype, to what I promptly replied, \u201cYes.\u201d Ryan and Cara looked beyond sad and although Cynthia is always the strong one, for I am the one that cries quite easy, this time she was the one crying so hard that at times when we were talking to them, she moved away from the camera to cry her eyes out. We were fortunate enough to see Bailey one last time and for that we\u2019ll be forever grateful to Bailey\u2019s parents. Thank you Ryan and Cara for giving us the opportunity to say bye and see Bailey one last time. You two are amazing people for sharing Bailey with us. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://allmycaninecompanions.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/cubaiely4.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-1743 aligncenter\" src=\"https://allmycaninecompanions.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/cubaiely4.jpg?w=510&#038;h=299\" alt=\"cuBaiely4\" width=\"510\" height=\"299\" /></a>Afterwards, Cynthia and I just sat at the dining room table, held hands and cried. Cynthia kept asking me, \u201cWhy did she have to die so young?\u201d The only thing I could come up with was, \u201cMaybe because whatever her mission was on this earth she got to accomplish it.\u201d I said this to Cynthia as a way to comfort her as well as convince myself that that was true, otherwise Bailey\u2019s departure, at least in my eyes, would have been unfair.</p>\n<p>Lately, Cynthia kept asking me why I haven&#8217;t posted anything about Bailey, and my excuse was, &#8220;You have to sit with me to pick the pictures I&#8217;ll post in my blog.&#8221;\u00a0 But the truth was that I avoided writing about Bailey because I felt as if by delaying this post I could hold on to her a little longer.\u00a0 Crazy?\u00a0 I don&#8217;t know.\u00a0 What I do know is that the heart does not rationalize, it just feels.\u00a0 And my heart wanted to hold on to Bailey for as long as I could, but my head kept telling me to get on with it and write about her, so I finally did.</p>\n<p>Dear Bailey, or as Cynthia used to call her, BaBailey, please know that you were very much loved by your pet parents, the people that were fortunate enough to know you, like us, and the dogs you met along the way because your presence brought lots of laughter, joy, and love. You left such a hole in our hearts, but we don\u2019t regret loving you. See you later \u201cour\u201d beautiful BaBailey, we love you dearly.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1744\" style=\"width: 474px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://allmycaninecompanions.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/cubaiely5.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-1744\" src=\"https://allmycaninecompanions.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/cubaiely5.jpg?w=464&#038;h=261\" alt=\"Bailey, Cynthia, and Alex (L - R)\" width=\"464\" height=\"261\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Bailey, Cynthia, and Alex (L &#8211; R)</p></div>\n", "post_id": 1745, "location": false, "date": "07-22-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["dogo argentino", "mix breed dogs", "canine", "boxer", "Pit bulls", "bull dogs", "hump day"], "text": "<div id=\"attachment_1747\" style=\"width: 527px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://allmycaninecompanions.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/hump1.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-1747\" src=\"https://allmycaninecompanions.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/hump1.jpg?w=517&#038;h=404\" alt=\"Bella, Alex, and Dexter (L - R) Alex and Dexter to Bella, &quot;Wow!

alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a>Recently, I answered an ad in Craigslist in which it stated that they wanted to get rid of their 9 year old terrier because she snapped at their 2 year old child.\u00a0 The ad also stated that the dog was very sedentary and was not properly socialized.\u00a0 I replied to the ad by advising the owners to first talk to an animal behaviorist and trainer and see how it goes.\u00a0 I also told them that a bored and unexercised dog is really a recipe for disaster in any household regardless of whether children are involved or not.\u00a0 If after exhausting all the avenues available to them their dog was still snapping at people then they should place him in another home.\u00a0 Their response was an angry e-mail with language I prefer to keep to myself.</p>\n<p>This is where the problem starts with anybody ready to adopt or buy a dog, I prefer the former rather than the latter, but that is just personal preference, and that is:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Lack of exercise and socialization</li>\n<li>Lack of knowledge and unwillingness to learn from others with experience about dogs</li>\n<li>Believe that if the dog snapped at someone once he/she will do it again</li>\n<li>Dog\u2019s<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_level\"> energy level</a> is completely different than that of the pet parents</li>\n<li>No consistency when it comes to training, exercise, discipline, etc.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Don\u2019t misunderstand me, I do not recommend for anybody to keep a dog that they believe is ill suited for them, but you should try everything you can to see if what the dog is experiencing is something manageable specially when the dog is a senior.\u00a0 Why?\u00a0 because a lot of people prefer a puppy rather than a senior dog because as all you dog lovers know, puppies are adorable. I raised two puppies of my own, but to be quite honest the next time I adopt I will overlook the puppies and go for a dog that is 3 years or older.\u00a0 Why?\u00a0 I\u2019d like a dog that is active, but if I wanted to vegetate on a Saturday afternoon, she\u2019d be right next to me asleep on the couch making me company.\u00a0 That would be my perfect companion and that is what I have at the moment.\u00a0 Alex, my mix breed female dog, that is about to turn 10 in May of this year is perfect for my family.\u00a0 I walk twice a day, weather permitting, and as she has aged I have noticed that she does not care to go out and walk when its very cold even though I make her wear a sweater so I have to adjust the time and length of our<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls\"> walks</a>, but when I just got her as a puppy I used to take long, long, long, walks with her because she was very energetic, but that is what I had to do because she was my dog and I needed to be responsible.

I am not trying to discourage people from adopting or buying a dog, au contraire, please enrich your life by adding a dog to your life, but pick the right dog so the experience is good for you and the dog you pick.\u00a0 Good luck to all new pet parents, and many thanks to those who choose to adopt.</p>\n<p><strong>January 25, 2012 \u2013 Goodbye, Our Beautiful Baliey </strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allmycaninecompanions.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/img_2097.jpg\"><img title=\"IMG_2097\" src=\"https://allmycaninecompanions.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/img_2097.jpg?w=300&amp;h=294\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"294\" /></a></p>\n<p>Bailey</p>\n<p>A little over a year ago, I replied to an ad in Craigslist for a pet sitter.\u00a0 After an exchange of a few e-mails, we agreed to meet at our home and see if Bailey, their <a title=\"Canis lupus familiaris\" href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?id=9615\" rel=\"ncbi\">dog</a>, and Alex, our dog, would get along.\u00a0 Bailey was fine with my girlfriend, Cynthia, and myself, but not as friendly with Alex.\u00a0 We thought that Bailey and her parents would not come back after this meeting, but to our surprise they did and Bailey entered our lives and our hearts in late 2010.</p>\n<p>Because Bailey\u2019s parents traveled quite frequently, we had the opportunity to see Bailey very often and for longer than just a weekend stay.\u00a0 Time went by, and little by little Bailey accepted Alex and without realizing it we started to get very attached to her, specially my girlfriend Cynthia.\u00a0 The thing Cynthia loved to do the most with Bailey was to hug her as soon as we woke up and Bailey seemed to enjoy this love fest very much as well.</p>\n<p>Bailey stayed with us for <a title=\"Thanksgiving\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanksgiving\" rel=\"wikipedia\">Thanksgiving</a> and we were more than happy to have her, but the day that her parents came to pick her up I found out that they all would be moving to California and I was surprised, but more than anything I was really sad.\u00a0 They left and I told Cynthia about it.\u00a0 We were sad, but glad that she\u2019d be coming back for the upcoming holidays which would give us more time with her.\u00a0 That night while thinking about Bailey I was overcome with so much sadness and I was taken aback for I had not felt this way since my aunt passed away, and I had a hard time going to sleep that night.\u00a0 Yes, I was heartbroken.\u00a0 I also did something I only do in rare occasions; I prayed for her and her parents.\u00a0 I know for a lot of people praying comes quite easy, but for me it has to be something very important or big for me to pray.\u00a0 Anyway, I felt as if a hole was carved in my heart which previously was occupied by Bailey.</p>\n<p>During her last stay with us, we spent a lot of time with Bailey and took a lot of pictures.\u00a0 We had a wonderful time together.\u00a0 The day Bailey\u2019s mom came to pick her up we asked her to stay for lunch and she was gracious enough to accept.\u00a0 That meant we could keep Bailey a little longer, of course, but we also did it because both her parents were very nice people and this would be the last time we\u2019d see them.\u00a0 We all walked Bailey and her mom to the car and then we saw them leave.\u00a0 Boy, that was a hard pill to swallow.</p>\n<p>Bailey\u2019s mom started a blog to document their trip to California, and everyday, twice a day, I check for pictures of their adventures and always hope that she posts as many pictures as possible of Bailey.\u00a0 Yes, we miss her dearly and maybe one day we\u2019ll see her again.</p>\n<p>You know what? Every dog that enters our life take a piece of our heart and even though Bailey will be far away from us, she\u2019ll always be close to our hearts and I am very glad and grateful that she was in our lives even though it was only for a short period of time.</p>\n<p>We love you Bailey and you\u2019ll always have a second home with us.\u00a0 Enjoy California with your parents and make many, many, new friends.</p>\n<p><strong>January 31, 2012 \u2013 Don\u2019t Judge a Book/Rottweiler by Its Cover</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allmycaninecompanions.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/maggie-the-rottie.jpg\"><img title=\"Maggie The Rottie\" src=\"https://allmycaninecompanions.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/maggie-the-rottie.jpg?w=300&amp;h=200\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a></p>\n<p>Last week, a <a title=\"Pet\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet\" rel=\"wikipedia\">pet</a> parent contacted me to see if we could pet sit his dog for the first time and, as customary, I asked him a few questions about his dog, Maggie.\u00a0 We agreed to meet a couple of days later to make sure that his dog and ours were compatible.\u00a0 I told my girlfriend that the dog was a 6 year old female <a title=\"Rottweiler\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/dog-breeds/Rottweiler\" rel=\"dogstercom\">Rottweiler</a>, but she said that it was ok and to meet her before we made any decision.\u00a0 When we saw Maggie, it took our breath away because here was a 105 lb. Rottweiler that looked intimidating and fierce.\u00a0 My girlfriend looked a little hesitant, for not saying a little afraid, and I just thought to myself, \u201cWow, you are so beautiful and huge, like Max\u201d.\u00a0 Max was a <a title=\"Dogo Argentino\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/dog-breeds/Dogo_Argentino\" rel=\"dogstercom\">Dogo Argentino</a> that belonged to my sister and he was an amazing dog, to say the least.\u00a0 Max looked intimidating, but he was extremely loyal to his family.\u00a0 But, I digress.\u00a0 I always walk for about 10 minutes with a new prospective boarder and our dog, and while doing this I noticed that Maggie wanted to smelled Alex, but because Maggie was so big Alex looked a little hesistant, translation: a little afraid, so we continued walking with Maggie and Alex for a couple of minutes.\u00a0 The reason I do this is to asses the dog\u2019s body language, temperament, etc.</p>\n<p>After our walk, we all came in and I talked to Maggie\u2019s dad asking him questions about her quirks, likes, dislikes, etc.\u00a0 I showed him Alex\u2019s bed, and I told him that I change the sheet I cover her bed with and that of the dog that stays with us every other day in order to keep them clean unless it needs to be changed sooner.\u00a0 While doing this, I knelt on the floor to show him Alex\u2019s bed and Maggie sat right next to me and gave me a couple of kisses.\u00a0 That\u2019s it, I was in love, again.</p>\n<p>Maggie stayed with us five days and she was a pleasure to have in our home.\u00a0 She is the only dog we\u2019ve had so far that actually was trained and listened to commands.\u00a0 She did look quite intimidating, but she was such a sweetheart.\u00a0 We walked with her and people, more than once, crossed the street when they saw us coming.\u00a0 Why?\u00a0 She looks scary.\u00a0 I was thinking, \u201cIf they only knew how wonderful, obedient, and loving this dog is, you\u2019d change your mind and ask me if you could pet her\u201d.\u00a0 But, that was not to be.</p>\n<p>Many times we do judge a book by its cover like in Maggie\u2019s case, but I think that all of us, whether we are talking about <a title=\"Dog\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog\" rel=\"wikipedia\">dogs</a>, people, religion, etc., should be more open minded because what we find is usually the complete opposite of what we expect.\u00a0 Aside from my aunt who raised me, the best teachers I have had happen to be dogs.\u00a0 They\u2019ve taught me about patience, which I have little of especially with humans, loyalty, love, compassion, and I am sure that every dog that comes into my life will leave a little paw print in my heart, mind, and soul anf for that I\u2019ll be forever grateful.</p>\n<p><strong>February</strong><strong> 3,

smile.\u00a0 Yes, people, dogs do smile:)</p>\n<p>Well, this was short-lived because once I went out to walk with her I started to think about all the headaches this ex-tenant gave me and, yes, you guessed it, I was in a bad mood all over again, and I noticed that Alex walked not next to me, but rather a little behind me.\u00a0 This exasperated me and I told her, \u201cYou got to be kidding

is a being on this earth that knows when my mood changes that is Alex.\u00a0 I told her, \u201cI am sorry for being such a pain to you.\u00a0 I am human and I have a hard time living in the moment,

href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling\" rel=\"wikipedia\">bike riding</a>, and we both throughly enjoyed it, but before anybody reading this end up thinking that we are some sort of athletes, let me dispelled such crazy thought and tell you that we mostly walked.</p>\n<p>Bike riding with Alex started because of her.\u00a0 Yes, what a terrible influence my daughter is on me.\u00a0 She was an extremelly active dog and the two long, long, <a title=\"Base on balls\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls\" rel=\"wikipedia\">walks</a> a day did not seem to help so I started to

supposed to do.\u00a0 I would recommend for you to read very carefully the website I have listed and then go from there.</p>\n<p>I started slowly with Alex.\u00a0 First, she just walked next to me and the bike.\u00a0 After that, I got on the bike and started to move slowly and she followed.\u00a0 Then, being the curious girl that she is, while jogging she was trying to sniff the bike.\u00a0 I stopped and let her sniff it, aka introduce each other, and once she was done I got back on the bike and started to peddle.\u00a0 She ran right next to me for about 5 minutes.\u00a0 We walked and then again \u201cwe\u201d biked.\u00a0 As time went by, I saw that she could go further and further.\u00a0 But everytime we went out for a <a title=\"Bike Ride\" href=\"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bike_ride\" rel=\"rottentomatoes\">bike ride</a> I always, and I emphisize this a lot, checked her pads after the run to make sure they were fine and that there was nothing caught in them.</p>\n<p>Well, time went by, and we still go out for our bike rides, but now they are fewer and much shorter because my girl is 9 1/2 years old, and, let\u2019s not forget, I am also aging, but we certainly enjoy them.</p>\n<p>The time I feel truly free is when I am dancing and when I am bike riding with my girl, Alex.\u00a0 So go out with your dog and have fun.</p>\n<p><strong>February</strong><strong> 6, 2012 \u2013 Bike Riding With my Beautiful Alex \u2013 Part I</strong><strong>I</strong></p>\n<p><strong><a

alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a></strong></p>\n<p>Today, Sunday, the day really looked gloomy.\u00a0 It looked like it was about to rain or snow and it was pretty cold.\u00a0 I was about to go and take Alex for a walk, but I really wanted to go <a title=\"Cycling\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling\" rel=\"wikipedia\">bike riding</a>, so I stood by the front door for about 5 minutes trying to make up my mind.\u00a0 What if it rains?\u00a0 What if we are only able to go around the corner?\u00a0 Then I thought to myself, \u201cSo what?\u00a0 Go out and enjoy the day with Alex?\u201d\u00a0 And so we did.</p>\n<p>I put Alex and my <a title=\"Folding bicycle\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folding_bicycle\" rel=\"wikipedia\">folding bike</a> in the back of my CRV and we went to a really nice trail about 10 minutes from home, and to my surprise my girl, Alex, was really in the mood to run.\u00a0 She usually runs right alongside of me, but this time she was a little ahead of the bike and twice I had to tell her to slow down.\u00a0 She is in better shape than her mom.\u00a0 We were out for a little over an hour and no, we did not bike the entire hour.\u00a0 We walked and biked.\u00a0 A couple saw her running with me and one of them said, \u201cShe is so cute.\u00a0 And she is wearing a sweater\u201d.\u00a0 And as all you dog lovers know, that just made my day because of that nice compliment directed to my daughter.\u00a0 Yes, when it gets cold she wears a sweater that by the way she has never learned to like nor appreciate, but she still has to wear it.\u00a0 Anyway, Alex sniffed some trees and God only knows what else and after we were both tired we headed home.</p>\n<p>As soon as we got home, I took her to the deck and brushed her, cleaned her paws, and checked her pads.\u00a0 All intact.\u00a0 She then proceeded to drink water and went straight to her little bed in the kitchen while a late lunch was being prepared.\u00a0 After we ate we headed upstairs, Alex to sleep and her moms to wait for <a title=\"Super Bowl XLVI\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XLVI\" rel=\"wikipedia\">Super Bowl XLVI</a> to start.</p>\n<p>I cannot speak for other people except for myself, but having a dog as a companion is really relaxing for me and it also gives me the opportunity to be more active and forget any worries I may have when I am with her.\u00a0 I think dogs do more things for us, humans, than we do for them, and lucky are those of us that realize this.</p>\n<p><strong>February</strong><strong> 7, 2012 \u2013 Cesar Milan in a Word? Inspiring.</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong>Funny, entertaining, and very true.</p>\n<p><strong>Februrary 7, 2012 &#8211; What is The Best Remedy for Anger and Rage?\u00a0 Your Dog</strong></p>\n<p>Natural anger is useful and we need it. But rage is anger out of control and there\u2019s nothing useful or funny about it. Some people compare it to a rampaging elephant, but this insults the animal kingdom. Animals feel anger for good reasons but they cannot control it. Human rage is so ugly because people can and should control anger with intelligent dignity.</p>\n<p>About a year ago, Summer time, for a reason that I cannot even recall, I got into a very heated argument with my girlfriend.\u00a0 When they say that you see red when you are enraged, I can say that that is so true.\u00a0 I was not angry.\u00a0 I was enraged.\u00a0 I knew that all that was going to come out of my mouth was going to be hurtful and maybe even unfair therefore I decided to walk away.\u00a0 I lay on the couch and I was hoping that sleep would soon take the place of the rage that I was feeling, but no such luck.\u00a0 My girlfriend came over and started to talk to me.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know what on <a title=\"God\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God\" rel=\"wikipedia\">God</a>\u2018s green earth she said for she was the last person I wanted to see or hear at that moment, but seeing that she got no response from me, for it was quite clear that I was very angry, she walked away.\u00a0 I thought to myself, \u201cGood.\u00a0 Finally some peace and quiet\u201d.\u00a0 A few minutes later, yes you guessed it, here she comes again, but this time with Alex.\u00a0 I, then, heard her tell Alex, \u201d go and lie on the couch next to mommy\u201d.\u00a0 She obediently did just as she was told, and as soon as she settled next to me, I started stroking her ears and head and thought to myself, with a smile on my face at this point, \u201cyou are so soft and beautiful\u201d.\u00a0 I did this for a couple of minutes and seeing that it was \u201csafe\u201d to approach me my girlfriend started to talk to me.\u00a0 I got up and I was still a little angry, but not enraged.\u00a0 We talked and worked things out.</p>\n<p>Later on, I asked her why did she put Alex on the couch with me?\u00a0 To what she responded, \u201cYou were not angry, you were enraged and there was nothing I could say or do to get you out of that mindset so I decided to use Alex to calm you down and it worked.\u00a0 She is the only being I know that can get you out of a bad mood, or in this case enraged mood, in a matter of seconds\u201d.\u00a0 She was right.</p>\n<p>If there were to be a pill for anger/rage in the future, I would not buy it.\u00a0 Why?\u00a0 I have my dog, Alex, and the best part about it is that there are no side effects.\u00a0 Well, except for the wet kisses, but I can live with that.</p>\n<p>If you are interested in reading the whole article about anger, visit this website: <a

9, 2012 &#8211; Mom, I Can Teach You To Be More Social<a href=\"http://allmycaninecompanions.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/img_2189.jpg\"><img title=\"Our Long Road\"

sister and she told me that her neighbors thought of me as a hermit because the only thing they ever heard from me was, \u201chi, and bye\u201d.\u00a0 My sister, on the other hand, would stop by and stay a while talking to them, but I chose to say hello\u00a0 and I kept going without a second thought.\u00a0 Her neighbors asked her if maybe I did not like them for some particular reason, to what she responded, \u201cNo.\u00a0 It just takes a while for her to warm up to people\u201d.</p>\n<p>Time went by, and one day I remembered this and told myself that I was going to pay attention to how I acted and reacted to people and see if it was true that it takes me a while to trust people.\u00a0 I decided to do this because I am a firm believer that everyday we have to try, although many of us fail, to be better than yesterday.\u00a0 My findings were actually somewhat comical, well, at least to me.</p>\n<p>During my self-assessed \u201cstudy\u201d, I realized that certain settings made me more comfortable than others.\u00a0 If I were at work, I would talk to anybody even those I did not know well.\u00a0 But once I left work, I noticed that unless the other <a title=\"Person\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person\" rel=\"wikipedia\">person</a> initiated contact I made no attempt to interact with him.\u00a0 Now, here comes two very interesting findings; one, if the person had a dog with him, I would right away make an attempt to interact with this person; two, if the person did not have a dog with him, I did not even bother looking at him.\u00a0 This reminded me of something that happened to me a while ago.\u00a0 A woman walking with a very uncooperative puppy was coming down the street and her face looked flushed and she was angry, to say the least.\u00a0 My usual reaction, and that of many others, would have been to leave the woman and puppy alone, but I surprised myself because I went straight to the woman who looked at me with a lot of anger and disdain.\u00a0 I told her that her puppy was beautiful, I saw a faint resemblance of a smile on her face, and that <a title=\"Puppy\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puppy\" rel=\"wikipedia\">puppies</a> sometimes are very stubborn.\u00a0 She looked at me again, this should have been the time when I ran as far away as possible from this woman, and started to talk to me.</p>\n<p>I still cannot believe I did that.\u00a0 If she did not have a dog with her, I would have kept walking, I know that for sure.\u00a0 Well, since I figured out that I find <a title=\"Dog\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog\" rel=\"wikipedia\">dogs</a> more interesting than people, now I try, emphasis on the word try, to say hello even if that person does not have a dog with him.\u00a0 This is my ritual; first, I look at my dog\u2019s body language towards that person; second, I look at the person\u2019s body language; third, I tell myself, \u201cpeople are interesting too, people are interesting too\u201d; fourth, still talking to myself, \u201cremember to be a better person today than you were yesterday\u201d; fifth, I finally say hello.\u00a0 Boy, that took so much energy from me.</p>\n<p>The only bad thing about this approach is that many times because of my lengthy ritual, the person passes by and either he says hello first or neither of us acknowledges the other.\u00a0 Well, I did try.\u00a0 Right?</p>\n<p>Alex, my dog, is not only my companion, but also my teacher.\u00a0 Thanks to her, I am attempting to be more social, but I know this is a very long and hard road, but I\u2019ll navigate it with her, so I know everything will be fine.</p>\n<p><strong>March 1, 2012 \u2013 Never Say Never, Specially When It Comes to a Dachshund<a

alt=\"Snickers, on the left, and Alex, on the right.\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a></strong></p>\n<p>I always liked medium and big dogs.\u00a0 I never saw myself as a pet parent of a little dog unless it was a puppy, but then something very strange happened to me one day.\u00a0 About a year and a half ago, a couple contacted me so I can take care of their dog, Snickers, for a couple of days while they were out-of-town.\u00a0 As you can see by the picture, she is a senior, but don\u2019t let the white on her face fool you.\u00a0 She loved to play and take small walks.\u00a0 She was an active girl, to say the least.</p>\n<p>For some odd reason, every time I had a chance I would pick her up, hold her close and talk to her.\u00a0 Now, what was I telling her?\u00a0 Who knows?\u00a0 Although, I think that by the time she went back home she was bilingual since I usually use <a title=\"Spanish language\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">Spanish</a> when I was telling her sweet nothings.\u00a0 The day came when her parents came to pick her up and as I saw her leave, I felt a wave of sadness running through my heart.\u00a0 I thought to myself, \u201cIs this sadness or indigestion from eating too much?\u00a0 Even before I asked myself that question, I knew that it was sadness.</p>\n<p>Time went by, and her parents contacted me again so I can take care of Snickers.\u00a0 I gladly said yes to them.\u00a0 This time she stayed a little longer and, yes you guessed it, the pain was a little more evident.\u00a0 I thought, \u201cI like all dogs, but I prefer medium to large dogs, so why do I feel this way?\u201d\u00a0 Epiphany.\u00a0 Oh, oh.\u00a0 I had fallen in love with a Dachshund and it only took me a couple of months to figure it out.</p>\n<p>Don\u2019t take me wrong.\u00a0 Alex, my dogo/pit bull mix, is the best dog I could have ever wished for but even now I hold a very special place for Snickers in my heart.\u00a0 I was thinking about getting a dachshund from a rescue place, but Alex is almost 10 years old and I think she deserves to be the only dog without having to compete for my time and affection with another dog.\u00a0 Therefore, my next dog, I am pretty sure will be a dachshund.\u00a0 By the way, because I like this breed I am following a blog, <a href=\"http://href.li/?http://thewienertakesitall.wordpress.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">thewienertakesitall</a> , and yes you guessed it.\u00a0 The blog is about the adventures of a very handsome dachshund.\u00a0 I look at it this way, if I can not have a dachshund right now I can certainly live vicariously through this blog.\u00a0 What do you think?</p>\n</div>\n", "post_id": 389, "location":

I answered an ad<span style=\"color:#000000;\">\u00a0for long-term boarding a male pit bull, and after some e-mails and phone calls were exchanged, we agreed to meet and see if my home would be\u00a0the right\u00a0environment for Kingston.\u00a0 </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Now, I&#8217;ve had, so far, one <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"American Staffordshire Terrier\"

class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Dog breed\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_breed\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">breed</a>, but I never expected for Kingston to look so impressive.\u00a0 I was taken aback at his size and gladiator physique, but at the same time quite curious about his temperament and quirks.\u00a0 Yes, dogs, just like us humans, have quirks.\u00a0 We took a walk with Kingston and Alex for a couple of minutes and his <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Body language\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_language\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">body language</a> was that of a puppy; curious and playful.\u00a0 Anyway, after our walk we went straight to the kitchen and I spent some time talking to Kingston&#8217;s mom while I continued to assess his body language, curiosity level, and his interaction with his mom and myself.\u00a0 A couple of days later, Kingston&#8217;s mom agreed to leave him with us and he&#8217;s been a part of our family for the last couple of weeks and I&#8217;ve had nothing but great and funny experiences with him.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Although he does look impressive and intimidating, what

href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">female dog</a>.\u00a0 I see no aggression at all on his part, and I do hope that this was the kind of dog that people would breed rather than aggressive dogs that give <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Pit bull\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pit_bull\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">Pit Bulls</a> a bad

them.</p>\n<p>To be quite honest I never knew that a dog can snore, dream and even bark while asleep until this beautiful pit bull, Kingston, walked into our lives.\u00a0 Alex is very quite.\u00a0 She does not snore, all right, all right, I&#8217;ll come clean, she does, but that is only when she eats a big meal,\u00a0and only on certain occasions\u00a0I&#8217;ve heard her growl at God only knows what.\u00a0 Anyway, one night I was reading in bed and I hear &#8220;someone&#8221; snoring, then barking so my first reaction was to look at Alex, but she was sound asleep.\u00a0 Then, I looked at Kingston, and he was the &#8220;someone&#8221; snoring.\u00a0 Not only was he snoring, but he was having a very vivid dream because he snored, and barked loud enough to wake up Alex.\u00a0 I just laughed because Alex looked at me as if saying, &#8220;Mom, you&#8217;ve got to be kidding me.\u00a0 He not only snores loud, but barks as well while asleep.\u00a0 How come he does not bark when he is awake?&#8221;.\u00a0 Now, that I found very interesting.\u00a0 He does not bark during the day time.\u00a0 He only does it when he is playing with Alex, he is trying to get her to play with him, and when he wants the nylabone\u00a0she has at that moment.\u00a0 I have nylabones all over the house, but the one he wants, yes, you guessed right, is the one Alex is chewing on.\u00a0 They are quite an interesting pair.</p>\n<p>I am blessed because I have them in my life and for that I&#8217;ll always be grateful, and I am cursed because now I have sensitive ears and this beautiful pit bull

went by going out on a Friday or Saturday night was not as important as\u00a0before and that \u00a0instead I looked forward to dinner at home, followed by movies we rented while Casey and Alex slept either next to us on the couch or their bed.\u00a0 Yes, I was happy staying at home.\u00a0 Unbelievable, but true.</p>\n<p>Time went by, and now days my dancing nights have greatly declined.\u00a0 I

deal with a scooting <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Dog\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">dog</a>, and usually it is overlooked when this is done only in rare occasions, but if your dog is constantly scooting and he leaves some brown or yellow secretion on your carpet, bed, etc., you need to take him to the vet as soon as you get a chance because there is a good chance that his <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Anal gland\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anal_gland\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">anal glands</a> are impacted, infected, or abscessed, but the best way to find out if that is the case\u00a0and rule out any possible underlying problems is by talking to your vet.</p>\n<p>Kingston, the beautiful pit bull staying with us, had this problem so I took him to the vet and she told me that\u00a0his anal glands were\u00a0impacted and\u00a0that if this was left untreated he\u00a0could have developed an abscess which\u00a0would have been very painful for him.</p>\n<p>The vet told me that\u00a0some dogs get their anal glands impacted because there is not enough fiber in their diet while there are others that never have this problem.\u00a0 Kingston had his anal glands expressed at the <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Veterinarian\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinarian\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">vet&#8217;s office</a> and she told me to do the following in order to avoid or diminish the possibility of a recurring episode:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Feed him premium food</li>\n<li>Maintain proper weight.\u00a0 Overweight dogs are prone to scooting</li>\n<li>Exercise your dog every day.\u00a0 A sedentary life can aggravate this problem</li>\n<li>Add fiber to his food such as: apple, oats, <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Brown rice\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_rice\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">brown rice</a>, beans,

Kingston, but we stayed close to home, meaning within a good 20 minute walk from home, because it looked as if it was about to rain.\u00a0 Both of them were eager to go for a walk, yes, even my Alex, so we got our gear on: brushes, bags, extra <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Leash\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leash\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">leash</a>, etc., and headed out the door.\u00a0 We were walking for about 15 minutes when out of nowhere this beautiful long-haired dachshund comes running towards us at full speed barking as if there was a fire nearby and he needed to alert everybody.\u00a0 I immediately stopped and both, Alex and Kingston, stopped as well.\u00a0 Neither one of them pulled or tried to lunge at this little dog.\u00a0 Instead while the little dachshund was still in a barking frenzy, they both looked at each other and then at the dog that was making all this noise as if saying, \u201cWhat is wrong with you?\u00a0 Why are you barking so much and so loud?\u201d\u00a0 They were both quite curious and I think even amused about this little guy.\u00a0 At that moment, I hear a guy saying, \u201cSorry, that\u2019s my dog.\u00a0 Don\u2019t worry, he does not bite\u201d.\u00a0 When the guy finally picked him up he said, \u201cHis name is JZ, sorry\u201d.\u00a0 I told him, \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing that both my <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Dog\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">dogs</a> are laid-back and not aggressive, but if your dog were to approach another dog in the way that he did, barking and running at full speed towards them, he\u2019d have been bitten because that crazy energy in their world is not balanced nor accepted.\u00a0 Please, be careful with your dog and put a leash on him\u201d.\u00a0 He then explained to me that his dog is never without a leash, but that this time he, an escape artist, got out of the car so fast that he was not able to do anything except run after him.\u00a0 We said good bye and I kept walking with Alex and Kingston.</p>\n<p>Please, pet parents, put a leash on your dog.\u00a0 It\u2019s not only for your dog\u2019s safety, but for other\u2019s as well.\u00a0 Your dog can get run over by a car, bite another dog, or a person, and may be even cause a <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Traffic collision\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">traffic accident</a>.\u00a0 Unless you know you have total control over your dog, like some people do, please protect your dog and put him on a leash.\u00a0 Take the time to train your dog so when you open the door he does not bolt out like a crazy canine, but rather waits for your signal that it\u2019s ok to come out.</p>\n<p>When I put Alex and <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Kingston, Ontario\"

comes down otherwise she\u2019ll run out the door and get hurt.\u00a0 I make both of them sit down so I can put their leash on and once I\u2019ve accomplished that, then, and only then they are allowed out of the car.\u00a0 They both already know the drill, but Alex sometimes takes a little longer to settle down.\u00a0 My daughter suffers of <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Attention\"

life.\u00a0 When I was a child living in <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Ecuador\" href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=-0.15,-78.35&amp;spn=10.0,10.0&amp;q=-0.15,-78.35 (Ecuador)&amp;t=h\"

rel=\"dogstercom\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">American Staffordshire Terrier</a>.\u00a0\u00a0 He was a handful, to say the least, and because of his breed before he turned a year old, I\u00a0enrolled him in Obedience I.\u00a0 I wanted him on his best behavior because I knew he had a lot of potential, but also because of his breed.\u00a0 I loved going to the training classes with him, and Casey seemed to enjoy it a lot as well.\u00a0 One of the things the trainer, Janet Bennett, told us was that it is normal to get mad at your dog sometimes.\u00a0 We are human after all, right?\u00a0 But, and this is a big but, you were not to hold a grudge because this would confuse your dog.\u00a0 <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Dog\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">Dogs</a> live in the moment, unlike us, humans, that allow things from our past continue to bother us.\u00a0 Anyway, Casey truly pushed all my buttons.\u00a0 He was a very difficult and challenging dog with an aggression problem to complicate things even more.</p>\n<p>I enjoyed the classes so much that I ended up taking a total of 3 classes, Obedience I, Obedience II and <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Canine Good Citizen\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canine_Good_Citizen\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">Canine Good Citizen</a>, with the

and called her.\u00a0 We talked for about an hour.\u00a0 The exercise I had to do with Casey, over and over and over again, which consisted of once I got angry at him I would correct him and then I had to let go of my anger worked better than I thought. \u00a0Forget therapy.\u00a0 Casey was the best therapy I could have ever hoped for and what a wonderful beginning this was for me.\u00a0 This happened many years ago.</p>\n<p>A couple of months ago, my mother, sister, and only niece, betrayed my confidence in a way that I had never thought possible.\u00a0 To say that I am hurt would be an understatement.\u00a0 I thought about what happened years ago, and I told myself that I am going to allow time and my dogs heal this wound and, the optimist that I am, perhaps get the same outcome I had years ago.\u00a0 I raise my wine glass, just kidding, to a new beginning.</p>\n<p>I saw a post that I enjoyed a lot that said something like this, \u201cI feed my dogs.\u00a0 They feed my

know, I know, many times we are not in the mood, we don\u2019t have enough time, or we are too tired.\u00a0 These are all good excuses, but you and your dog can greatly benefit from a walk.\u00a0 For your canine companion and you the benefits of walking are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Bonding time for you and your dog</li>\n<li>A great way to keep those pounds off, yes for you and your dog</li>\n<li>A chance to socialize with other pet parents and their canine kids</li>\n<li>To drain excess energy that can lead to unwanted behavior</li>\n<li>Explore new neighborhoods</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These are just some of

moved to go anywhere, Roxy was the first one to move and get close to me, followed by Kingston, and then Alex.\u00a0 They are all so beautiful, different, and amazing in their own particular

because Alex wants to give every person she encounters a kiss, in other words a saliva bath, and Kingston copies her behavior. \u00a0Now as many pet parents know, there are those who do not appreciate this type of attention so I was hoping Alex would be in her best behavior.\u00a0 Anyway, to my surprise they both did wonderful.\u00a0 The \u201cproblem\u201d actually came in the human form.\u00a0 Cynthia is now obsessed with photography so she took her camera and started to take pictures while we walked, of course she would stay at least 40 minutes in the same place.\u00a0 How can she take so long?\u00a0 Never mind, only a photographer could answer that question, I guess.\u00a0 Well, seeing how fast she was at this new hobby, I decided to keep walking with Alex and Kingston and come back for her later on.</p>\n<p>A while later, we came back to find her and she was nowhere in sight. \u00a0I started to walk back and forth with panic in the pit of my stomach and thinking, \u201cthis is the third time going back to the same spot so after this I am calling the police.\u00a0 Darn it, no signal\u201d.\u00a0 Yes, I was that scared.\u00a0 Why?\u00a0 There are so many horrible stories about people being abducted in the blink of an eye that to say that I was afraid was an understatement.\u00a0 We finally found her with a big smile on her face.\u00a0 Let\u2019s just say for brevity\u2019s sake that I told her loud, all right, very loud, and clear never to do that again.\u00a0 She apologized and after that she\u2019d only take a couple of minutes to take her

another.\u00a0 Pet parents, please, put a leash on your dog.\u00a0 He can either hurt others or hurt himself.\u00a0 Cherish the time you have with your dog, and don\u2019t put him in harm\u2019s way.</p>\n", "post_id": 571, "location": false, "date": "07-12-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["fearful", "Breed", "dominance"], "text": "<p><a

pet parents, as the picture clearly shows, love to hug our <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Dog\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">dogs</a>, but please make sure that you are doing this properly or your dog, yes your own dog, can bite you.\u00a0 A hug to us, humans, just means a physical expression of our feelings and we enjoy doing it, but to a dog a hug means invasion of <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Personal space\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_space\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">personal space</a> and dominance.\u00a0 If you enjoy hugging your dog, like most of us do, please be aware of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A dog sees a hug as a sign of dominance</li>\n<li><a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Hug\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hug\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">Hug</a> your dog after your daily walk.\u00a0 Both of you will be tired and he\u2019ll be less likely to fight back your hug because he is too tired to do it</li>\n<li>Do not surprise your dog.\u00a0 Allow him to see where you are coming from so he does not get fearful of your movements</li>\n<li>Praise him after you hug him.\u00a0 You could even offer him a treat so he can associate a hug with a treat and as such this would become a pleasant experience</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Aside from being careful, and this is very important, please be gentle when hugging your dog.\u00a0 If you have a <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Pit bull\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pit_bull\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">pit bull</a> like Kingston, the beautiful boy in the picture, that is very <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Affection\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affection\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">affectionate</a> and craves attention and hugs and weighs around 70lbs. then I\u2019d venture to say, yes hug him.\u00a0 Do not hug any dog that you know for sure does not like such attention regardless of the breed.\u00a0 Now, if on the other hand, your dog is a little dog barely weighing 10 <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Pound (mass)\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_%28mass%29\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">lbs.</a>, I beg you to please hug him gently.\u00a0 A 70 lbs. dog and a 10 lbs. dog need to be handled differently.\u00a0 Yes, dogs are adorable and I do understand your desire to show him affection, but do it carefully and gently.\u00a0 Cynthia is famous for hugging our dog, Alex, hard.\u00a0 A few times when she hugged her too hard, Alex whimpered in pain, and let\u2019s not forget that she weighs 45 lbs. therefore she is not a little dog, but she never has attempted to bite her. \u00a0Instead she walks away from Cynthia and comes straight to me with a face that I\u2019d venture to say is telling me, \u201cOuch!\u00a0 Could you please tell her that it is ok to hug me, but to be a little gentle because I am a skinny girl and her hugs hurt me?\u201d</p>\n<p>If you pay attention to the picture, I think Alex is actually relieved that the object of Cynthia\u2019s affection happens to be Kingston and not her.</p>\n<p>By the way, I am not advising pet parents not to hug their dogs.\u00a0 Au contraire, show your dog how much you love him, but please do it nicely, that\u2019s all.</p>\n", "post_id": 577, "location": false, "date": "07-20-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["patient", "relax", "wisdom", "lunch", "home", "walk"], "text": "<p><a

my girl, <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Alex Nu\u00f1ez\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Nu%C3%B1ez\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">Alex</a>, was dragging her feet.\u00a0 Being the patient person that I am I told her, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me.\u00a0 How can you be tired?\u00a0 We just started our walk\u201d.\u00a0 She looked at me with those dark brown eyes and I felt as if she were telling me, \u201cMom, why are you so impatient?\u00a0 What\u2019s bothering you?\u00a0 Don\u2019t be like that with me\u201d.\u00a0 I apologized to her.\u00a0 Yes, I do talk to my <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Dog\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">dog</a> and I do apologize, many times, when I know I\u2019ve done something wrong. \u00a0\u00a0I slowed down my pace and told myself that she does that once every blue moon so live with it.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t know if this happens to other pet parents, so feel free to give me some feedback, but I can see so much in my girl\u2019s eyes, so much wisdom and kindness.\u00a0 This week I was very nervous because I had to go to court and I was afraid of the outcome so I skipped lunch.\u00a0 Now, skipping lunch for most people is not a big deal, but for me this happens to be a huge deal.\u00a0 Ok., I\u2019ll come clean.\u00a0 To me skipping lunch is more like the end of the world because I love to eat.\u00a0 Anyway, as I was about to leave from home, I saw Alex looking at me as if telling me, \u201cMom, relax.\u00a0 You\u2019ve got this.\u00a0 It\u2019s going to be ok\u201d.\u00a0 I looked at her and told her, \u201cI am so glad I have you in my life\u201d.\u00a0 Alex was right.\u00a0 The outcome was positive for me and I was very pleased and relieved.</p>\n<p>I know that a lot of people think of dogs as objects, but for me, Alex, is part of my family.\u00a0 She is the one that; calms me down when I am starting to see red: sooths me when I feel like my life is chaotic and in upheaval; and gives me kisses when I cry.\u00a0 As I told more than a few people, and some of them laughed at me, but that\u2019s ok., my daughter, Alex, is perfect.\u00a0 She is perfect for me.\u00a0 Why?\u00a0 Because she teaches me every day to be kind, to try hard to be patient, to try and overlook the annoying things my loved ones do, because let\u2019s remember that I probably do many things that also annoy those that love me, and well, so much more.\u00a0 That\u2019s my Alex.\u00a0 My daughter, my companion, and my teacher.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "post_id": 580,

grunts while waiting for me to put his food down as if saying, \u201cPlease, hurry up\u201d</li>\n<li>He sounds like a bird when he is getting impatient</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Those are just some of the

had <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Chest pain\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest_pain\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">chest pain</a>, which is something I have not felt in months.\u00a0 I felt weird.\u00a0 No, I did not go to the hospital, yes, I know you are asking at this point, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you go to the hospital?\u201d\u00a0 Because my chest pain is always related to something bad happening to a loved one that I have a connection with and once I find out who this person or being happens to be, the <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Pain\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">pain</a> disappears.\u00a0 I did not call or text anybody because I did not want to alarm them so I watched <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Television\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">TV</a> and later on went to sleep.</p>\n<p>Early in the morning, before taking Alex and Roxy for a walk, I checked my e-mail and I found out the culprit for my chest pain: Maggie, the beautiful rottie.\u00a0 The pain had disappeared.\u00a0 Maggie\u2019s dad apologized because he was not going to be able to bring Maggie to stay with us for the upcoming holiday and explained to me that Maggie had stage 5 cancer and that she was not responding to chemo and that she even had a hard time getting up therefore he\u2019d be ending her suffering soon.</p>\n<p>As I was reading this e-mail, tears were running down my face and I had to read it again to make sure that I understood what he wrote.\u00a0 I was so, so mad and sad.\u00a0 How could such a beautiful dog like Maggie leave us so soon?\u00a0 Alex and Roxy were looking at me as if asking, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u00a0 I wiped my tears and I tried to compose myself, but Alex would not leave my side so I touched her and said to her, \u201cI am ok, don\u2019t worry.\u201d\u00a0 As if on cue, right after I said that Alex went to <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Sun tanning\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_tanning\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">sun bathe</a> and looked relaxed.</p>\n<p>I told my girlfriend about it and said to her, \u201cI hate when I feel this way.\u00a0 These freaking premonitions I have don\u2019t do that person or being I love any good because by the time I feel something is wrong, there is absolutely nothing anybody can do for them.\u00a0 I hate it and I wish I did not have it for it is useless.\u201d\u00a0 I was so angry and in pain that I also said other things I do not care to repeat for I hate cursing, and that is what I did for a few minutes.</p>\n<p>Maggie is the first dog that I had the opportunity to pet sit that is going to that rainbow bridge.\u00a0 I am so glad and grateful for the time I had with her.\u00a0 I am also hurt and pissed, but that is just me being human.\u00a0 I cannot even imagine what her parents are feeling at this moment.\u00a0 I\u2019ve realized something today that I did not know until now and that is that even though I know that the <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Dog\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">dogs</a> I pet sit are not mine, they become part of me and to my surprise the pain of losing them is not diminished just because the dog does not happen to be Alex.\u00a0 What can I say?\u00a0 I fall in love with all of them and I feel as if they are mine.\u00a0 What a crazy <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Pet sitting\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet_sitting\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">pet sitter</a> I am.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve asked <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"God\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">God</a>, yes I believe in God even though I pray very little and only for special loved ones, that when my time comes the only thing I\u2019d like is for all the dogs, mine and the ones that came into my life, to help me cross that Rainbow Bridge, this way we can all cross it together and never be apart from each other again.\u00a0 That to me would be <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Heaven\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">Heaven</a>.</p>\n<p>I love you Maggie and I was honored and privileged to have had you in my life for you are one unique and amazing dog.\u00a0 One of a kind.\u00a0 I will miss you terribly, but I\u2019ll see you one day again.\u00a0 May your

Thrifty means, wisely economical, careful and diligent in the use of resources.\u00a0 The way I look at it is this way: If I am thrifty and I go to a restaurant, I\u2019ll give the appropriate tip or perhaps a little more if the service was really good, but if I am cheap, regardless of the type of service I get, I\u2019ll leave nothing for a tip.\u00a0 I\u2019d like you to aim for the former not the latter.</p>\n<p>Here are some things I do and recommend:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Walk your dog. Overweight <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Dog\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">dogs</a> require more visits to the vet.</li>\n<li>Brush your dog.\u00a0 It will lessen the amount of times you need to take your dog to the groomer because of that funny smell.\u00a0 Dogs do not need to be bathed very often.\u00a0 Get a <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Brush\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brush\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">brush</a> and at least once a day, after your evening walk, brush for at least 3 minutes.</li>\n<li>Brush your dog\u2019s <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Tooth\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">teeth</a>.\u00a0 Less cleaning appointments will be required.\u00a0 If not comfortable brushing his teeth, get some Nylabones which helps clean teeth and reduces tartar.</li>\n<li>Second hand dog towels.\u00a0 Towels that you do not use because the color is fading or it has a little hole.\u00a0 Use them to dry your dog.</li>\n<li>Homemade <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Dog food\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_food\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">dog food</a>.\u00a0 Instead of buying those expensive can goods for dogs which, by the way, makes them fart so bad I want to run out of the room, cook some food for your dog and refrigerate and/or freeze leftovers.\u00a0 Your dog will love the taste and you\u2019ll enjoy being able to breathe fresh air rather than his farts.</li>\n<li>Clothes.\u00a0 Check out your local <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Charity shop\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charity_shop\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">Thrift Shop</a> or Craiglist and take a look at what they have to offer.\u00a0 Alex is wearing a little girl\u2019s bathrobe I bought for $3.00</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now, these are the things you should never skimp on:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Vet care.\u00a0 Your dog depends on you, therefore take him for his vaccines and yearly check-up.</li>\n<li>Premium food.\u00a0 Don\u2019t buy cheap dog food because in the end, both, you and your dog will pay for it.</li>\n<li>Training.\u00a0 Find a reputable trainer and take at least one class with your dog and you\u2019ll see that he is more manageable and you\u2019ll both enjoy it because of the time you\u2019ll spend together</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There are more things you can do and probably come up with on your own, therefore if you do, let me know so I may be able to use them as well.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "post_id": 598, "location": false, "date": "08-17-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<div id=\"attachment_603\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://allmycaninecompanions.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/img_1725.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-603\" title=\"Braised Chicken\" src=\"https://allmycaninecompanions.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/img_1725.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200\" alt=\"Braised Chicken\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Delicious Braised Chicken</dd>\n<dd class=\"wp-caption-dd\"></dd>\n<dd class=\"wp-caption-dd\"></dd>\n<dd class=\"wp-caption-dd\"></p></div>\n<p>My girlfriend, Cynthia, makes the most delicious dishes I\u2019ve ever tasted and that is saying a lot since this is coming from a very picky eater.\u00a0 Anyway, a while ago she made braised chicken and I enjoyed every bit of it, and of course I decided to give a little bit of it to Alex.\u00a0 When she was younger, Alex could eat anything and it would not bother her <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Stomach\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">stomach</a>, but as she grew older her stomach became more and more sensitive, therefore what she gets mostly now days is chicken, rice and yogurt.

puppy.\u00a0 Why the behavioral change?\u00a0 Don\u2019t know and quite frankly don\u2019t care either.\u00a0 I was just glad that my face was not as red as the shirt I was wearing because of embarrassment which is customary when I take her to the vet.\u00a0 Believe it or not, I was hoping that the vet would think I was having one of those infamous <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Hot flash\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_flash\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">hot flashes</a> I hear so much about rather than realizing that I was dying of embarrassment because of Alex\u2019s hyper nature.</p>\n<p>Anyway, my girl was given a clean bill of health and I\u2019d have to take her back in 3 weeks for a <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Booster dose\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_dose\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">booster shot</a> for <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Lyme disease\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyme_disease\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">Lyme disease</a>.\u00a0 As soon as we got home, she was very thirsty and tired. \u00a0I gave her some water and she went straight to bed.\u00a0 She woke up later and ended up on the couch right next to me.\u00a0 I sat down to watch TV and I kept touching her.\u00a0 She probably thought, \u201cMom, please let me sleep.\u201d\u00a0 I think it was more for myself than her for I wanted to reassure myself that she was still with me, safe and sound.\u00a0 Alex is a very healthy girl, but I also know that she is 10 years old so now more than ever I really appreciate the time I have with her.</p>\n<p>If you forgot to schedule an appointment to see the vet, please do not delay and get your dog updated on all her vaccines and make sure she gets her yearly check-up.\u00a0 Enjoy your canine companion.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "post_id": 606, "location": false, "date": "09-06-2012", "mentions": [],

rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">dog</a>.\u00a0 Here are some of them:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In the Winter, she prefers to walk after 8:30am and her last walk to be taken by 7pm</li>\n<li>She prefers to have 3 smaller meals rather than 2 big meals</li>\n<li>I believe she lost some of her <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Taste bud\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste_bud\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">taste buds</a>, therefore I mix chicken, rice, yogurt, etc., to her kibble to entice her to eat</li>\n<li>She sleeps more than she did before and always looks for her

target=\"_blank\">walks</a> behind me rather than next to me so I cut the walk short</li>\n<li>She seems to enjoy having her teeth brushed at night time more than when she was a puppy</li>\n<li>She walks slowly</li>\n<li>She still plays, but the sessions are shorter and gentler</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One thing, we, pet parents, must keep in mind when our dog is a senior dog and that is that we must adapt to the changes that she will go through in the future and change our routine accordingly.\u00a0 Enjoy your dog companion, but please be aware that a senior dog has limitations so be gentle with her.</p>\n", "post_id": 614, "location": false, "date": "09-19-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Breeds"], "text": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_620\" style=\"width:

Dreamland</p></div>\n<p>Every time a <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Dog\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">dog</a> is to stay with us, I like to do a little bit of research on that particular breed, but since Josie\u2019s mom told me that Josie was a lab and I knew about the breed, I decided to let it go.\u00a0 Anyway, Josie has come to stay with us a couple of times, but her <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Behavior\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">behavior</a> was not that of a lab.\u00a0 I looked at her very carefully and noticed her quirks and behavior and started my research.\u00a0 Josie, I found out, happens to be a <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Weimaraner\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/dog-breeds/Weimaraner\" rel=\"dogstercom\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Weimaraner</a>.\u00a0 Aha!\u00a0 Now her behavior makes sense.\u00a0 As per <a href=\"http://www.terrificpets.com\">www.terrificpets.com</a>, a Weimaraner is, \u201cKnown to be bold and excessively rambunctious, this breed loves to hunt and run. If not allowed to do what their heart truly desires and is pent up, they will develop a destructive manner with sheer frustration. With a tendency to be headstrong and stubborn, lack of exercise or running will force these traits into a negative and unhappy dog. They need a yard that is large enough to run and explore in, and a home that allows them to sleep indoors on cool and cold nights, due to their very short hair.\u201d</p>\n<p>The description fitted Josie perfectly.\u00a0 Josie\u2019s beautiful, big body wiggles like crazy every time she sees Alex, while Alex maintains that alpha demeanor so Josie can come down.\u00a0 It usually takes about 2 minutes.\u00a0 Josie is extremely loving, but getting her to do things such as: sit, down, come, etc., is a struggle.\u00a0 Her mom said that she knew all this commands, but I think she has <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Attention\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">selective hearing</a> like Alex.\u00a0 Anyway, I kept thinking of a way to get her to follow commands without having to repeat myself like a broken record, and I finally had an epiphany: Food.\u00a0 Josie is very <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Food\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">food</a> oriented, so I decided to use food to get her to do what I want.\u00a0 These are the things Josie does with food as an incentive, and surprisingly with repetition even without food as a reward:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sits patiently while I get her food ready</li>\n<li>Sits without whining or moving by the door as we get ready to go for our walk</li>\n<li>Goes to bed on command</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This may seem insignificant to some pet parents, but to me this is pure joy and success.\u00a0 Josie stays with us about once a month, therefore I am going to continue training her because, yes, Waimaraners are stubborn, but it just means that training with her will take a little longer than with other dogs, but the results are more than worth it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "post_id": 618, "location": false, "date": "09-26-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p><a

class=\"wp-caption-dd\">A couple of days ago, while brushing Alex&#8217;s hair after one of our daily walks, I noticed two small lumps.\u00a0 One on her undercarriage and another one on the right side of her ribs.\u00a0 Since I had to take her for a <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Booster dose\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_dose\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">booster shot</a>, I asked the vet about it and I was told that most senior dogs develop <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Adipose tissue\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipose_tissue\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">fatty tissue</a> <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Tumor\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">tumors</a>, and that they are not malignant, but to make sure the vet recommended doing a <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Needle aspiration biopsy\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needle_aspiration_biopsy\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">needle aspiration</a>, which involves taking a sample of cells from the tumors and looking at them under a microscope.\u00a0 As you can probably guess, Alex was not pleased with the possibility of having this procedure done, but I want to make sure that she is fine, therefore as she was walking away from me, she threw me a glance that told me, &#8220;Mom, I don&#8217;t like this&#8221;, and the brave person that I am turned around and let the vet take her while I had guilt written all over my face.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-caption-dd\">Anyway, I&#8217;ll find out in a couple of days if these are only fatty tissue tumors or not.\u00a0 Alex is a very healthy dog, therefore I am counting on her amazing genes, her diet of premium food and food I cook, yes, I don&#8217;t cook for myself, but I do cook for Alex, and all the exercise she gets on a daily basis to see her through what I hope is something related to old age and nothing else.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-caption-dd\">I am

against choke collars.\u00a0 Au contraire, use it, but again, do it properly.\u00a0 I had a dog a long time ago that did excellent with a choke collar.\u00a0 I did a very light correction, and I got

reason why I am usually sweaty is due to my dancing and not the chore at hand.\u00a0 Anyway, for some unknown reason, I started to think about my childhood in Ecuador with my aunts and cousins and I remembered going to the beach in the afternoons, coming back full of sand around my legs, and the smell of the sea on my skin, but above all, I remembered being very happy.\u00a0 I miss my aunts dearly.\u00a0 One of them, my aunt Maria, passed away in 2007 and even now while writing this I feel like crying.\u00a0 My other aunt, mi mami Elvirita, she raised me that is why I call her mom, lives in Ecuador and usually comes back to the US once a year to visit family. \u00a0Now that I am an adult, all the memories I have of them I keep them close to my heart.\u00a0 Ok, I miss my family, what

title=\"Bed\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">bed</a> for your <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Dog\" href=\"http://seaworld.org/animal-info/animal-bytes/animalia/eumetazoa/coelomates/deuterostomes/chordata/craniata/mammalia/carnivora/domestic-dog.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"seaworld\" rel=\"nofollow\">dog</a> regardless of whether or not she is a small, medium or large size dog.\u00a0 This is specially important for puppies and seniors.</p>\n<p>When I have a dog staying with us, I always ask the <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Pet Health\" href=\"http://www.everydayhealth.com/pet-health.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"everydayhealth\" rel=\"nofollow\">pet</a> parent to bring a bed for the dog, but even if the pet parent forgets to bring one, I always provide one for the dogs staying with us.</p>\n<p><a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Maggie Simpson\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maggie_Simpson\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">Maggie</a>, a Westie, always enjoys her bed, but Oliver is a little different.\u00a0 This is Oliver&#8217;s routine: first, he tries the cold tiles; second, tired of the tiles, he heads for the wood floors; third, and finally, he gets on his bed for a nap.\u00a0 All dogs are different.\u00a0 Some love their beds, while others, like Oliver, take a little longer to get to it.</p>\n<p>Nowadays there is a huge variety of beds and it can be overwhelming trying to figure out what to buy for your dog.\u00a0 My advice is: go to the store with your pet and she&#8217;ll help you figure out which one to get.\u00a0 Alex has a total of 4 beds.\u00a0 Cynthia, my partner, always jokes that Alex has more beds than us, and that is true.\u00a0 The funny thing about it is that every morning she looks at us with beautiful, but pleading eyes as if saying, &#8220;May I get in bed with you?&#8221;\u00a0\u00a0As long as there are no other dogs staying with us, she does get in bed with us for a couple of minutes before getting up to make breakfast.</p>\n<p>If you are a little short of cash, improvise.\u00a0 Get a pillow, which is usually a lot cheaper than getting a pet bed.\u00a0 Or, use old blankets you may be thinking of throwing away.\u00a0 The main thing is for you to get something that is comfortable where your dog can enjoy a couple of hours resting and dreaming.</p>\n<p>By the way, since I am feeling as sick as a dog,\u00a0these are the positive and negative things I&#8217;ll get out\u00a0of it:\u00a0positive: I&#8217;ll write more often in my blog, read and watch tv.\u00a0 Negative: my walks with Alex will have to be short or Cynthia will have to walk her and I&#8217;ll have to stay at home most of the time, and on top of that, I cannot taste all the flavors in my girlfriend&#8217;s food.\u00a0 Now, that stinks!</p>\n<p>What kind of bed your dog uses?\u00a0\u00a0And for those of you that happen to be sick with the flu, like me, I hope you get\u00a0better soon.</p>\n", "post_id": 827, "location": false, "date": "01-11-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags":

think I&#8217;ll wait until the weather gets a bit\u00a0warm before going outside to bbq.\u00a0 Although, the one that bbqs is Cynthia, but her sous chefs are usually right behind her and if you have dogs you know that they want to be wherever you are even if that means being in discomfort.\u00a0 Enjoy the beginning of this week with all your loved ones.</p>\n", "post_id": 836, "location": false,

believes to be a threat.\u00a0 Australian Shepherds are working dogs with a strong herding and guarding instincts.\u00a0 Walter fits that profile, but he is also amazingly sweet and loves hugs.\u00a0 With all these amazing beings around me, how can I not be happy and grateful for having them in my life?\u00a0 Yes, even a rainy/snowy day can be a wonderful day.\u00a0 It all depends on how you look at it.</p>\n", "post_id": 975, "location": false, "date": "03-07-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Bedrest", "taking a nap", "Weight loss", "United States", "Health",

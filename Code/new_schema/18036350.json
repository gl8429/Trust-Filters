he were a human, he\u2019d be twice divorced, probably on the wagon, and worried about his Visa bill, but luckily for him, he\u2019s not human. \u00a0Amicus is a collie/shepherd cross who just a week ago was adopted from the Cowichan SPCA shelter and driven to Powell River by his new owner, ALB, in her small blue Toyota Echo. \u00a0This blog will start with his time in Abbotsford when he was a stray and will be largely speculative leading up to his journey to Duncan to the Cowichan shelter and his eventual adoption by ALB, whereupon his current actual adventures will commence. \u00a0This is just an intro, but because ALB has to take a bunch of garbage to the Powell River (PR) dump, it must be cut short until later. \u00a0Thanks for tuning in, or whatever you call it in blogging patois.

blogged it was March 23, about three months ago, and here I was hoping to blog every day and develop a huge following and be popular and loved.\u00a0 Well, three readers, obviously I haven&#8217;t blogged every day and have not developed a huge following, but I do have the most important friend perhaps I&#8217;ve ever had, the most perfect companion and faithful hound who would follow me into hell, even though he&#8217;s destined for heaven, if such places there be.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>I remember before I found Amicus, but I knew I wanted to get a dog, I would be walking alone in the forest and sometimes I would yell out &#8220;Amicus! \u00a0Amicus!&#8221; as though I had a dog who would come trotting through the bushes when I called.\u00a0 I called it out to see how it would sound and to imagine outcomes, I called it out to tell the universe that I needed a dog right quick, and I called it out so that whoever Amicus would be would hear it and hurry up finding me.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>I figured if anyone else in the forest heard me they&#8217;d just figure I was someone with a dog, that no one would hear some woman calling &#8220;Amicus&#8221; out loud and guess that she was yelling to the universe and yelling to an unknown entity who she wanted desperately to meet.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>I think back to those days when I was all alone, not lonely, really, or at least I didn&#8217;t know I was, I suppose.\u00a0 You don&#8217;t know you&#8217;re lonely sometimes, I think, until you&#8217;re not anymore, until your big empties are filled with dog love.\u00a0 Hard to explain, but anyone with a dog knows what I mean, I think.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Anyhow, now when I&#8217;m in the forest and call out Amicus, I hear paws a-thunderin&#8217;, sometimes hear a-barkin&#8217;, I see brown and tan fur come a-chargin&#8217;, I see a wonderful bushy tail a-waggin&#8217;, a happy dog tongue a-lollin&#8217;, and when I call out Amicus now, Amicus himself comes a-runnin&#8217;.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>And that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been doing for three months since I last wrote, three intense beautiful months, exploring mountains, forests, lakes, beaches, and the whole of this little town I live in, exploring it with Amicus, a better friend you couldn&#8217;t find, fun</strong><strong>, brave, stalwart, generous, and smart. \u00a0When I call out Amicus now, I know I&#8217;m not alone and if anyone does hear me calling out, they better look out &#8217;cause Amicus is out there running back to me, and he&#8217;s in a hurry. \u00a0Now, when I call out Amicus, loves comes running to me, love comes crashing through the trees right to me.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>So maybe I&#8217;ll blog tomorrow or maybe it&#8217;ll be another three months, but right now me and Ami, we got important\u00a0stuff to do. \u00a0Amicus! \u00a0Amicus! \u00a0Come on, boy, let&#8217;s go!</strong></p>\n", "post_id": 1054,

collie nose in here once in a while and address you personally, so that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m doing, even though I am very busy with a specific challenging marrow extraction right now, rubber balls

thousands) we gave ourselves over to you lot with love, loyalty, and our whole hearts. \u00a0We of all the animals, no offence to cats or other pets (I figure they can write their own blogs), but we the dogs decided that we would be the closest, we would make you our everything, our god, even, if you like, and we would dedicate ourselves to protecting you and yours, to loving you with our entirety, and all we wanted was something to eat, a bit of warmth, and some love.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Sounds like a good deal, huh?\u00a0 We&#8217;ll never go back on this deal, never.\u00a0 No matter how you treat us.\u00a0 So we really need you to make sure that no one takes advantage of our promise to be yours completely.\u00a0 We need your protection and your help.\u00a0 We will give you everything, anyway, but if you can, please help us.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Many of my brothers and sisters are locked up

any small way, I personally would be so happy.\u00a0 I was where a lot of them are.\u00a0 I was about to die because I was so scared and sad that I felt I had to be mean and strong.\u00a0 MAFP came

mine this time who thinks he should get to write this blog just &#8217;cause it&#8217;s named after him.\u00a0 From time to time, buddy, from time to time.</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Ami and I went on a long walk today, a bit longer than our normal long walks.\u00a0 We found a new path off of the end of Nootka Street that cuts down into a logged but still wild bushy area that circles around to connect with the Penticton Street trails web.\u00a0 It&#8217;s a long way, lots of time to think.</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Ami, as usual, was padding along ahead of me smelling every shrub, peeing on every seventh rock, and occasionally he would stop dead in his tracks, staring out into the field at a big black stump that he couldn&#8217;t figure out, wasn&#8217;t sure what it was.\u00a0 All sorts of doggie imaginations scurrying through his mind until I kept calmly walking saying, &#8220;Yeah, it does look sort of creepy, doesn&#8217;t it buddy, could be all sorts of things, but it&#8217;s just a stump,&#8221; and Ami would sort of shrug a furry shoulder, almost nod, and then start walking again quickly gaining point ahead of me to go back to sniffing and peeing.</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#000000;\">My mind began to wander and suddenly I found myself listing all the many things I struggle with, every single one of my challenges, naming them off in my head, then moving on to the next.\u00a0 You know the sort of thing, insecurity, fear, needing approval from others, ego, shyness, anger, negativity, reactivity, and so on and so on.\u00a0 Then I decided to list all the good things about myself like being funny, smart, and liking animals and all the things I&#8217;ve accomplished in the last three years.\u00a0 Then I tried to put the challenges together with the good stuff and make it fit like scissoring jigsaw pieces so you can force them into place.\u00a0 Some of it connected, some of it didn&#8217;t.</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#000000;\">\u00a0Ami stopped again this time staring at a frozen black pond.\u00a0 He seemed both scared and curious.\u00a0 He started to head to the pond, but when he put his first toe near the ice, I called him back just in case something horrible happened.\u00a0 He shook his head, had a quick defiant pee, and we continued on our way, him on point, me trudging along, the sun starting to make the snow glisten on the path.\u00a0 I listened to my boots crunching through the white crust.</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#000000;\">My mind started trudging again, too.\u00a0 I went back to thinking about all my challenges and all the good things about myself and how hard it was to accept the former and hard to truly believe the latter.</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Trudge trudge trudge, crunch, crunch, crunch.</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Then I started to think about all those army and prison movies where, when the guy&#8217;s being inducted or incarcerated and he&#8217;s in the beginning reception-like stage, someone shoves a pile of clothes and gear across the counter towards him, you know, like uniforms, soap, boots, maybe, a steel cup, a big knapsack and a gun in the soldier&#8217;s case, whatever it might be, all his kit.\u00a0 The guy who shoves it towards him says something like, &#8220;This is your gear; it&#8217;s all you get, take care of it; you&#8217;re going to need all of it; some of it&#8217;s heavy and painful, don&#8217;t lose it; like I said, you&#8217;ll need it,&#8221; and off goes the soldier/prisoner to his next stage holding his gear close to his chest with both arms, his very important precious bundle.</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#000000;\">\u00a0I thought about that pile of gear, that bundle, and I started imagining some beleaguered spirit guide or someone like that, 48 years ago when I was forming in the womb, standing across a counter from my soul. \u00a0He shoves a big bundle of stuff towards me.\u00a0 It&#8217;s all my challenges and all my good stuff.\u00a0 He says, &#8220;This is your bundle; it&#8217;s all you get, take care of it; you&#8217;re going to need all of it,&#8221; and I nod accepting the then unfamiliar bundle from him drawing it towards me.\u00a0 I accept it.\u00a0</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#000000;\">And suddenly I thought, yeah, <em>I accept my bundl</em>e.\u00a0 I could feel tears actually welling up in my eyes as I thought to myself, yeah, and I love my bundle, too, all of it, and I <em>have</em> needed all of it.</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#000000;\">I suddenly felt the sun warm on my neck and could hear Ami rummaging as he sniffed a particularly interesting shrub.\u00a0 I felt like hugging myself.\u00a0 Ami suddenly looked around at me, his big tongue hanging out, smiling.\u00a0 He&#8217;s quite the bundle, too, is my houndie hound, aint&#8217;cha buddy.\u00a0 &#8220;Good boy, Ami,&#8221; I said, and he came over for a hug.\u00a0 I buried my face in his fur and gave him a big hug.\u00a0\u00a0 Then he had to go sniff something &#8217;cause sometimes he gets shy, too.\u00a0 I smiled and wiped the snow off my knees standing up.</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#000000;\">\u00a0Then we trudged on, crunching the snow and seeing our breath, and I thought to myself, I really like this new path we&#8217;re on.</span></strong></p>\n", "post_id": 1077, "location": false, "date": "01-15-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags":

\u00a0Otherwise I get too focused on outcome and trying to be perfect which clearly I will never be, nor my houndie hound, but we are very diligent and strong and so I want to just sometimes throw things out there without a huge degree of thought and polishing and all that bother.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>So I broke my ankle on January 20th. \u00a0Actually, I dislocated, tore, and fractured it and it&#8217;s only in the last two weeks or so that I&#8217;ve been back walking Amicus and back to the forest. \u00a0Being away from the forest was a little like if someone took your heart away for two months and gave you this little paltry spare one for that time. \u00a0I didn&#8217;t realize how much the forest now defines me and how much I need it. \u00a0Walking along a deep green path with the tri-color tans of Ami padding along ahead, watching him sniff and pee and enjoy the adventure and both of us never sure what&#8217;s up ahead or around the next massive cedar, there&#8217;s just nothing like it. \u00a0I started a little poem that I&#8217;m working on with this theme, so far all I&#8217;m sure of is, &#8220;The forest will forgive me, but concrete never can; metal signs say nothing, but ravens chant sublime.&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Other things I did in this broken ankle time was I entered a poetry slam which I&#8217;ve never done and I did really well. \u00a0I was super nervous beforehand, but the people there were so supportive and warm and the other poets so amazing and visionary. \u00a0One guy, Daun Pechawis, I think is like a force of nature, an elemental spirit, I was so impressed with him and how he revealed his heart through such solid writing. \u00a0I met a lot of people that night and I really felt like I was part of something, the community.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>I also discovered during my broken ankle period that I sure do love hot baths and boy did I miss them. \u00a0The first day the cast came off, like 25 minutes later I was sitting in hot water staring at the poor shrunken scaly little leg that now needed love and work. \u00a0But boy that hot water soaking into my soul felt good.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>It would be about two more months after that before I could get back to the forest. \u00a0I did realize however that the forest was always inside me, like that poem I wrote a while back, &#8220;When the forest gets inside us, it stays there,&#8221; well that&#8217;s true. \u00a0It&#8217;s funny now when I walk on a forest path I barely limp, but coming out onto a sidewalk or a parking lot, I limp again. \u00a0That&#8217;s partly what I meant about the forest forgiving me. \u00a0I also meant that only something alive is capable of forgiving and the forest is alive.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>I also went to a drumming singing session at Sliammon which is the First Nation that actually owns all this stolen land around here. \u00a0I went there just to acknowledge that I know that; it felt really important to me. \u00a0I was nervous and I don&#8217;t know how I sounded, but the people I met that night were very welcoming to me, and I am going to go back and sing more. \u00a0There was a competition song where the men would sing and then the women would sing back. \u00a0It was super fun. \u00a0In the last few verses, I let my voice go. \u00a0I felt awkward and nervous at first because I hoped I had said the right things and that it made sense. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>They were planning a canoe voyage where all different Bands meet up and have a big celebration. \u00a0It sounded like such an amazing journey and it made me feel sad because I don&#8217;t have that kind of beautiful culture where families go on big adventures and meet up with their strong amazing communities.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>And when we were all singing, I wanted to go out into the forest nearby and listen from a few 100 metres away and feel like it was hundreds of years ago, and I was one of the first visitors and I would honour the powerful people I met and if they wanted we would have done things all so differently with strong friendly respectful nations glorying in the land and the magical beauty and the whole next hundreds of years would be different, but I knew I couldn&#8217;t do that and that everything is so broken and wrong, and so, again, it was weird, &#8217;cause I felt sad and happy at the same time, sad because of the ways things are, and happy because I was singing with really friendly people and having fun. \u00a0It was weird to have all those same feelings at the same time.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>And I thought if I were them, these welcoming people I was singing with, that I would hate me and not want me there, and maybe they did feel a little of that inside, and understandably, but the way they made me feel was welcome and special and I just kept thinking, wow, way back when it could have all been so so different and beautiful and magical and it was all done so so wrongly and it is still is.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>But I really liked singing those old songs and hearing the drums, and now I know it&#8217;s even more true than I thought, when the forest gets inside us, it does stay there, and also that the forest will forgive me, but the concrete never can, metal signs say nothing, but ravens chant sublime.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Don&#8217;t know if all that goes together, don&#8217;t care. \u00a0Well, that&#8217;s it for today, this is me just throwing stuff out there.</strong></p>\n",

remains.\u00a0 It\u2019s like a habit that he doesn\u2019t realize yet he can just stop doing.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Now, here\u2019s where the apawlogee comes in.\u00a0 This habit that he doesn\u2019t realize yet he can just stop doing, well, I got one of those, too, and it\u2019s wanting/needing to be right.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>One of my best friends &#8211; let\u2019s call her O\u2019Riley &#8211; is very dog-friendly, very knowledgeable about canines, worked in a kennel for three years and saved quite a few dogs\u2019 lives, plus she\u2019s had dogs for as long as I have known her which is about 40 years now.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>We have been having a big two-day argument after she kindly invited me and Amicus to come and visit her for a weekend and I said I would have to think about it and how I didn\u2019t think Amicus was ready yet, and her countering with he\u2019s coming to a place of safety and love and the visit might really help him.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Well, like Amicus\u2019 barking/no-longer-necessary-fear habit, being right or really, wanting others to also think I\u2019m right, is my old no-longer necessary habit.\u00a0 If Amicus is going to shed his old habits, then I better put on my game face, suck it up, and do the same.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Our argument went back and forth and both of us probably said things and used tactics that were unnecessarily reactive, sort of like Amicus occasionally does.\u00a0 But as I was walking beside the ocean tonight with Ami in the dark, I realized that my good buddy &#8211; let\u2019s call her O\u2019Riley &#8211; is an awesome loving dog person and almost certainly in this case IS RIGHT, which of course would not only make me NOT RIGHT, but actually WRONG.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Hmmm, can I live with that?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Yes!\u00a0 I\u2019m wrong, I\u2019m wrong, I\u2019m wrong!\u00a0 So, old buddy old pal &#8211; let\u2019s call you O\u2019Riley &#8211; if the offer still stands, I would be honoured to visit your abode and your hound together with my Amicus who, YOU ARE SO RIGHT, could only benefit from making your acquaintance &#8211; as have I for many long excellent years &#8211; \u00a0I would truly appreciate your vast experience to help us, as you wisely said, \u201cguide\u201d Amicus through his fear and into the brave new cur he soon will be.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>I love you, \u201cO\u2019Riley,\u201d and I sincerely apawlogize. \u00a0XXOO</strong></p>\n", "post_id": 246, "location": false,

maybe only so far as to accept, yes, we shouldn&#8217;t really strive too much to be perfect, thinking because it&#8217;s too difficult a journey and usually we&#8217;re not up to it, but I now realize that it&#8217;s not too difficult a journey, it&#8217;s an impossible journey and a colossal waste of time, energy and spirit.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>It&#8217;s a laudable thing to improve and to grow, but unless I allow that large open room of imperfection to sit comfortably within me, to furnish that room with pictures of all my loved ones and to know that it is a very human room in which I will spend a large portion of my life, I will forever be creating distance between myself and others by actually living with some irretrievable fictional hope of what something/someone should be, should look like, a picture that will never ever realize itself anywhere but in my worried insane high-standard of it&#8217;s just not good enough.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Well, this is again something that Amicus is teaching me every day.\u00a0 He teaches it by being himself 100 percent 24/7 unflinchingly imperfect and thereby downright loveable.\u00a0 He needs to work on things and so do I.\u00a0 He&#8217;s scared of people and I have a lot of fear, as well.\u00a0 Sometimes he is not very clear and because of confusion something goes wrong; well, I&#8217;m not very clear sometimes, either, and people can&#8217;t read my mind.\u00a0 When I am calm, clear, and confident, Ami does exactly what he should do all the time.\u00a0 When Ami is clear, I know I better get him outside real quick or buy more carpet product, that sort of thing.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m explaining this coherently or not, but somehow accepting this concept of imperfection feels so good and so overdue.\u00a0 Like, for example, since I got Ami, the actual room I live in is messy and crazy whereas before everything had a specific place and there was no room for anything out of place.\u00a0 Now, I&#8217;m like all those people in movies I&#8217;ve always admired.\u00a0 Whenever I see a house or an apartment in a movie, I like to check out the furnishing, decoration, lived-in-ness, and I have often thought, boy, those movie sets look more lived in than my real place.\u00a0 I wish I could be like that.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Well, now I have one of those messy comfortable imperfect places where a body can come and go and really live, that wonderful crazy comfortable room of imperfection that Amicus and I now live in, the house that Amicus built.</strong></p>\n<p><strong> It&#8217;s real estate I highly recommend.</strong></p>\n", "post_id": 512, "location": false, "date": "12-01-2010", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center;

Instead of saying no and pulling Ami away, I growled and roared at him like a demonic jackel (which is strangely satisfying and got some very perplexed looks from passersby) and yanked with fair ferocity on his leash when he wanted to rush at a dog. It really worked!</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Dog training is really all about people taking Dog as a Second Language classes. Dog is a beautiful, simple, and clear language and I am honoured to be learning it. \u00a0Saying &#8220;No, no, no, no,&#8221; or yelling things in English is pointless, she says, and when I mean no, I have to speak vehement growling dog and when I want him to do something good, I say in a high sweet loving voice elongating vowels, &#8220;Siiiiit,&#8221; or &#8220;Coooome,&#8221; or Staaaay,&#8221; and then give him a treat. \u00a0She recommends I reintroduce treats back into his training and his walks, but instead of giving him additional treats, to give him like half of his breakfast and dinner.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Now, I make him do almost everything on my terms. Boundaries and limitations, and he&#8217;s not allowed on the couch or my bed for a while (which is a tough one, &#8217;cause he&#8217;s my scooshy pooshy) and I have to make him sit and stay before eating, leaving, entering. \u00a0He tends to sigh deeply sometimes, like I&#8217;m sure I would if I ever joined the army and someone started ordering me around, but he is actually very obedient when he understands the command. The dog trainer said German Shepherds and Collies (Ami&#8217;s two halves) are amazingly trainable if you speak Dog well and she also said that he doesn`t sound aggressive, per se, but just not thoroughly trained and vying for dominance because he is still unsure of his place in the world because of his unstable and &#8220;sheltered&#8221; background.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>So I feel so much better to have received some expert guidance that actually works and to be implementing solutions.\u00a0 It makes me feel confident, more self-assured, and not alone. I will keep you posted on investigating and instigating ongoing classes for Ami and how that fares. \u00a0Importantly, my friends and family have also been giving me really helpful and supportive advice. It is touching and soothing to feel firmly that Ami and I are definitely not alone on our journey and that people want to help us.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>I am also learning that if what I think is fully informed and functional, then other people&#8217;s opinions have less power or I give them less power, and know that what I am now doing is right..\u00a0 There is so much to be said, in my opinion, for having full facts and expertise on my side, even if that expertise isn&#8217;t mine -yet. </strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>I also think receiving help and being able to give help may be another huge lesson that Ami and I are learning.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong> I am also learning what being out there involved in living is like and what other people feel and think and how much we&#8217;re all actually alike, and how I need to let my guard down, open up, and stop judging myself and others so harshly. \u00a0We&#8217;re all on this adventure together and maybe we&#8217;re specifically all here to help each other out.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>I am also learning just how important clarity is; how so very important. \u00a0No one is a mind reader and some people/creatures don&#8217;t share my language. \u00a0Clarity is so simple and yet so easily dismissed. \u00a0Let me give you an example. \u00a0To say to someone, &#8220;Blah blah blah blah,&#8221; in a really loud voice means nothing, but to say, &#8220;Don&#8217;t do that,&#8221; in their own language might produce an actual result that can be repeated.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong> To explain to someone what I really mean also lets them know that my shit is all about me and there&#8217;s nothing for them to take personally because what I say and do and how I react is all about me. \u00a0I have to work on being clear and non-reactive in the &#8220;moment,&#8221; which is the hard part because that&#8217;s not my default. \u00a0I think it is really important also to stay engaged with other people, not to hide or shy away, but to talk things through, to find common ground, to be kind rather than right, but maybe I&#8217;m getting off track now, and if I am, that&#8217;s okay, too.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Basically I guess I am slowly striving to reprogram my defaults or at least reset them to what they perhaps once were. \u00a0 Sometimes I&#8217;m not even sure what I am learning, just that I am and that every so often I go, Oh, wow, so that&#8217;s what I just learned. Amicus is like a whole self-help university all in one dog.\u00a0 I&#8217;m so glad I met him and so glad he&#8217;s my good friend. \u00a0 Canis Emeritus Amicus. </strong></span></p>\n", "post_id": 563, "location": false, "date": "01-15-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Even though I definitely should be working right now, I felt a sudden pressing need to update the world a.k.a. my three readers on Amicus&#8217; progress because I typed in my name to google and some of the blog entries came up saying, &#8220;Amicus is definitely a fearful dog,&#8221; and while that was true at the time I wrote it, I want to strongly vehemently vigorously (you get the idea, right) stress that Amicus is definitely NOT a fearful dog any more, nor is he an aggressive dog. \u00a0He has been doing brave, wonderful, and sweet things and that is the current truth of\u00a0Amicus. We just visited my best friends, and Farther, their nine-year-old pit bull/lab cross, and Amicus are now sensai and student, respectively, and fast fearless friends. \u00a0Amicus and I climbed Valentine Mountain using only deer trails and sheer will power. \u00a0Amicus has charmed both trainers in town because they&#8217;re smart observant experts who know a good thing when they see it. \u00a0 Amicus does stick up for himself if he has to, but if you love him, he loves you. \u00a0He gives what he gets and he&#8217;s a work in progress. \u00a0Amicus is not a destination, he&#8217;s a journey. \u00a0Amicus loves dogs, except for two or three out of 100, and frankly my guess is they&#8217;re assholes, anyway, or maybe they just like mixing it up a bit. \u00a0He frolics, romps, and gambols &#8211; yes, gambols &#8211; when he meets other dogs and his big goofy mouth stretches back in a mammoth dog grin and his fluffy tail with its tiny tip of white goes awiggy-waggy. \u00a0He only occasionally barks at people when they come up behind us in the forest and that&#8217;s his job, right, and he shuts up pretty darn quick if I speak clearly to him in Dog. \u00a0So the current &#8220;in the now&#8221; truth of the matter is that Amicus is just a normal, happy, slightly reactive, and delightful houndie hound and, as for me, I am doing swell learning how normal, happy, slightly reactive, and delightful I am, too.</strong></span></p>\n", "post_id": 569, "location": false, "date": "02-04-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p><a

Everyone over here is in major learning mode.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Once I really thought about it and how much I hate it when someone goes, &#8220;Awwww,&#8221; or says, &#8220;It&#8217;s okay, Layne,&#8221; or whatever when I feel vulnerable or uncomfortable and how I&#8217;d way prefer them to ignore me, its become quite easy to not do that anymore about him.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Just took Amicus off leash along the seawalk and he was awesome, playing or avoiding dogs depending on his mood, no aggression, stayed within 20 feet of me the whole time; what fun we had!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Now, he&#8217;s sleeping guarding my door while I work.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>He made like a 30-foot avoidance circle around two little toy poodles as though they were killer werewolves; he cracks me up.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Yeah, he&#8217;s the swellest; he does have some fear issues we&#8217;re working through. He doesn&#8217;t like to be surprised and he is still scared of men unless they have cute playful dogs and treats and then he warms up to them.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>He&#8217;s awesome with me on all counts. I have been testing to see if he has any food aggression issues and started with feeding him his first handful of food out of his bowl as I crouched right down by the bowl and this morning I pretended to eat out of his bowl first and let him eat out of it with me, and he was totally fine wagging and crunching away, so it&#8217;s not at all aggression for him, he just gets scared sometimes.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Just took Amicus off-leash in the forest, as well, and he is the most awesome off-leash forest dog you could ever possibly want; sorry, Kimba, Zach, Jethro, Brown Dog, and Farther, but the best off-leash forest dog I&#8217;ve &#8220;ever&#8221; seen.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>So far Amicus has made these friends: Highway, Chica, Lulu, Peaches, Milly, and Barney.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Highway is a 12-year-old Australian something or rather; Chica is also an Australian something or rather, I guess Amicus has a thing for Ozzies; Lulu is a black border collie/lab/Akita/etc., I believe; Peaches is a sled dog who actually pulled a sled in Churchill, Manitoba, for two years; Milly is a Golden Lab who likes to bark happily a lot;<strong> </strong>and Barney is a Basset Hound.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>I don&#8217;t really know much about blogging; but sounds like a really fun idea; I&#8217;ll have to research that and learn more.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>I have to add Sally, a border terrier which I&#8217;d never heard of, and Max a Labradoodle to his friend list.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>I have had more conversations with strangers in the last four days than I have in the preceding year; and I kid you not.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Seriously, how have I managed these many years without a car and a big dog to ride in it?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>It amazes me that a huge strong creature with big sharp teeth who could easily rip out my throat and carry my head around chooses instead to give me happy sloppy kisses.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Amicus grabbed another dog&#8217;s tennis ball and then permanently lost it in the rocks; kind of embarrassing.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Thanks, Terri and Simon, I&#8217;m actually checking out that site Terri and I think I will start a blog about Amicus, WTF.

clearly what the trainers have been trying to tell me, which is that if you want a dog to come to you, you don&#8217;t say in a stern commanding voice, &#8220;Come,&#8221; instead what you do is you put on your high squishy gishy voice, put your hand in your jacket pocket, and say, &#8220;Does Pooky Looky want a treat,&#8221; and big butch Shepherd/Collie boy immediately comes trotting over, whereupon I give him a treat.\u00a0 Also I&#8217;ve realized it doesn&#8217;t matter how big the treat is, a molecule of flavour seems to satisfy him, and then I can easily and calmly grab his collar and, if need be, put his leash on.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>In the forest today, every single time I did this it worked and during high-stake situations, as well, where joggers and other dogs were involved and, in the case of one set of dogs, it was a good thing because, with hand on Ami&#8217;s collar, I asked the owner, &#8220;Are you dogs friendly,&#8221; and she answered, &#8220;Not really.&#8221;\u00a0 So I leashed Ami and we walked past them and, interestingly enough, Ami didn&#8217;t want to go near those two dogs, he wanted to go away from them, but had I not done my pookylookysquishygishy thing, he probably would have run up to them eagerly and then been pulverized.\u00a0 It also worked with joggers and almost every situation we encountered this morning.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>I am also teaching him a command which I made up which is &#8220;Hind,&#8221; which means he has to be behind me, not heeling, but behind me.\u00a0 This is very useful on narrow forest paths where if he&#8217;s leading and runs into dogless people, he will make the wrong choice figuring he&#8217;s running defence and start barking at them, whereas if I&#8217;m in the lead, I can reach back and grab his collar and then calmly decide what course of action is best.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Also we have ongoing leash lessons and I must say he is becoming very obedient and sensitive to what I want when he&#8217;s on the leash.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Also, on another note, what led me to finally figure all this out and crack down is the other day at Valentine Mountain we were heading up a path back to the car and suddenly out of the blue a fellow appeared right in our path and Ami was ahead of me.\u00a0 This was before implementing my pookylooky thing and so I said sternly, &#8220;Come&#8221; and went forward to grab Ami, but both my tone and my forward movement propelled Ami forward, as well, and then the young fellow smiled and started towards me, and Ami started barking and barking and went right up to the guy, and I finally did grab Ami and I apologized three times to the fellow who was wearing big headphones which he never did remove and he never did say a single word and I don\u2019t even know if he heard my apologies, but I do feel bad about it and it has led to me exercising even greater vigilance, discipline, consistency, and rigour in our outings, but I would like to say I&#8217;m sorry to the fellow if I ever see him again as he was happily strolling along listening to tunes and then tries to be nice to a lady and her dog and gets vehemently barked at for his well-intentioned efforts.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>So, kind fellow on the path at whom my dog barked, I apologize and want to assure you that it has led to me instigating greater control over my dog, so, seriously and sincerely, sorry and thank you.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Of course, if it turns out you were actually a serial killer and were smiling because the knife in your pocket felt so lovely, well, then thank you, Amicus.\u00a0 I&#8217;m just saying.</strong></span></p>\n", "post_id": 849, "location": false, "date":

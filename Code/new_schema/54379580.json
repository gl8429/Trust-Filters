Put down the quote, and then realize I never got the second check I asked for to cover all this damn work, so back on the phone to TD Take All Your Money and find out what happened. \u00a020 minutes later, I find out they never sent the damn the damn check. \u00a0I CHECK my temper, ask nicely if they could please send it out NOW, and hang up. \u00a0I am now having thoughts of a very nice glass of wine&#8230;no bueno, Ame Baby &#8211; you have come too far to blow it now. \u00a0Take a few deep breaths, email some people, and then remember what the therapist had said about after care when I get done being sliced and diced. \u00a0Call my ortho&#8217;s PA &#8211; all of them have lovely PA&#8217;s who don&#8217;t answer their phones. \u00a0Leave a message while trying not to lose it about the check and the car and more thoughts of a cocktail &#8211; this time a lovely large Svedka and seltzer over ice. \u00a0The phone rings (there go my minutes on the phone this month, I am sure) &#8211; it&#8217;s the PA. \u00a0She explains I will most likely be sent to a rehabilitation facility afterwards because I live alone, and have no one to help me. \u00a0I sputter WHAT???? and she says that is the most likely scenario, but that they will do that before discharge &#8211; discuss things with me, make decisions on home aid versus rehab facility, etc. \u00a0Hang up with her (wow &#8211; only nice female on the phone today) and TOTALLY melt down. \u00a0Epic nuclear proportions. \u00a0Email Val and Karen, text DeDe and then call my mother (shock) who thank the goddess answers the damn phone. \u00a0I loose my shit. \u00a0I am wailing I want a drink, nothing is going right, I fucked everything up, I am going to be homeless in 7 months, my $$ isn&#8217;t here &#8211; OMG the crap that came pouring out would have won \u00a0me an Oscar had it been filmed. \u00a0Scarlett O&#8217;Hara had NOTHING on how drama queen I was being. Carry on about how everyone keeps saying how strong I am and I amn&#8217;t &lt;&#8212; new word, on and on and on. \u00a0 I really did want a drink, though. \u00a0Like &#8211; I really really would have given anything to just get rip roaring \u00a0drunk. She tells me everything will be fine, it&#8217;s okat, I am not horrible, people will be there to help (yeah? WHO?), etc. \u00a045 minutes later (I now KNOW I am going to be fucked by <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"AT&amp;T\" href=\"http://www.att.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"homepage\" rel=\"nofollow\">AT&amp;T</a> for over minutes) I finally get off the phone with my mother, who is off to her chicken club meeting, not an AA one (chicken club?? \u00a0fried, with mayo???) , email Val who was frantically trying to call, email Pete and DeDe and take a deep breath. \u00a0Crisis over &#8211; hopefully. Install <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Microsoft Office\" href=\"http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"homepage\" rel=\"nofollow\">MS Office</a> (old copy) on laptop (prays it works &#8211; it does &#8211; go me!!). \u00a0Go back to FB, chat with a few people who care, ask Jennie why I didn&#8217;t get a baby shower invite &#8211; she says they haven&#8217;t gone out yet, how was I so I told her &#8211; that was the end of THAT convo, lol, \u00a0send out a prayer request for Donna&#8217;s hubby, remember her auction the nanosecond it is over (not that I can buy anything anyway), play with Justin and Azure, take my pills, post the worst post ever for a book release (which I did fix this morning), have 3 cupcakes for dinner at 9 pm (fuck my body), do some ebay feedback and Steve texts me. \u00a0Did I see his picture in the paper. \u00a0I say no, because after reading the local paper whist sitting and having a double decaf espresso and some quiche while waiting for therapy and realizing just how right wing slanted it is, I vow to never read it again. \u00a0I go their site, plug in his name, and an obit from January pops up with a woman named Marion from across the river who left a son named Stephen Ulmer. \u00a0Steve&#8217;s mom&#8217;s name is Marion. \u00a0That freaked me out totally, so I emailed that to him and finally decided I need sleep. I crashed. \u00a0Totally crashed.</p>\n<p>So today is another day. \u00a0Up at 5:30, re-do blog, get morning FB out of the way, decided to post here, and now Steve is blowing up my phone while getting tires on his car (WAY more expensive than mine, and mine aren&#8217;t cheap!!) and going to move forward on a more positive note today. \u00a0:) \u00a0 I am even going to print out the morning yoga thing I found and try that. \u00a0What I REALLY want to do is go back to bed. \u00a0But no. I will not. \u00a0I will be strong.</p>\n<p>I got the eye of the tiger, the fire<br />\nDancing through the fire<br />\n&#8216;Cause I am a champion, and you&#8217;re gonna hear me roar<br />\nLouder, louder than a lion<br />\n&#8216;Cause I am a champion, and you&#8217;re gonna hear me roar!</p>\n<p>So, what&#8217;s the point spread on me having another meltdown today? \u00a0;)</p>\n<p>Oh yeah &#8211; PS &#8211; you GO, Sinead O&#8217;Connor. \u00a0Stand up for mental health and Miley&#8217;s setback of the sexualization of women and put that little dumb ass bitch in her place. \u00a0Miley &#8211; keep your damn tongue in your mouth, stop twerking, stop trying to be &#8220;ratchet&#8221; and go back to singing nicely, like you did when you did Jolene. \u00a0And STFU!!!!!!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amebaby.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/snapshot_20130904.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1089\" alt=\"My lovely ankle\" src=\"https://amebaby.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/snapshot_20130904.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 1085, "location": false, "date": "10-04-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Lies", "PayPal", "Facebook", "Stradivarius", "Rage"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://www.tarot.com/daily-horoscope/pisces/2013-10-05#.UlAk91bMOVU.wordpress\">Pisces Daily horoscope for October 5, 2013</a>.</p>\n<p>Serious doubts about the uncertainty of my future?? \u00a0That&#8217;s the funniest fucking thing I have heard in months!!! \u00a0Let&#8217;s see. \u00a0I am having major surgery in less than a month. \u00a0I have no clue IF I am coming home afterwards or going to some &#8220;rehab facility&#8221; (who will watch my animals and my house, helloooo??) or if I DO come home, who is going to be here to help me? \u00a0I will run out of money in 7 months. \u00a0That means I will be homeless. \u00a0My mother says we won&#8217;t let that happen. \u00a0I trust her as far as I can throw her, which I would like to do a lot lately. \u00a0I am filing for disability, but if you can&#8217;t even spell my fucking name right on the 800 pieces of paper you sent me to fill out, my faith in you getting it done quickly is pretty much shot. \u00a0My kid? \u00a0I go out yesterday to go food shopping &#8211; they are TOO TIRED to come with me, but could I get them a few things? \u00a0$140 later &#8211; my Food Stamp card is empty, I am $25 in cash broker than when I got there, and when I get home and say something, I get tude. \u00a0I went to bed, slept like shit as usual, got up and immediately started arguing with said daughter, who can&#8217;t even remember her own lies half the fucking time &#8211; yes DeDe &#8211; I was 21 once, too &#8211; I remember what it&#8217;s like to be selfish and think the world owes you everything and no one has it worse than you do and you work soooooooo hard &#8211; let me take you somewhere and show your lazy spoiled privileged entitled (in YOUR mind) ass what REAL hard work is. \u00a0I may not make my surgery, because I will probably have a heart attack or a fucking stroke before I even make it up there. \u00a0The world is full of incompetent assholes and I seem to be surrounded by the best of them these days!! \u00a0After an epic text war (I am not worth enough for a phone call or gods forbid a fucking visit), I finally said I am done, give me back the keys, and get the fuck out of my life. \u00a0Do not talk to me, do not pass go, do not collect $200. \u00a0Or has it changed for inflation or the drop in the market?</p>\n<p>I hear the door open, she comes in all quiet and contrite &#8211; I am sorry mom, I didn&#8217;t mean it I&#8217;m stressed I&#8217;m this I&#8217;m that, yadda yadda on and on for 1/2 and hour. \u00a0It has taken me until now to realize I have done it again. \u00a0I fell for it again. \u00a0She was here, she did nothing but take my food, and leave. \u00a0No help &#8211; oh wait &#8211; Boone took out the garbage and they did walk to Family Dollar for me, but more promises were made, which means more lies were told, and I can BET you any amount of money come Tuesday she will be busy, have to work, sick or something else and I will be yet again fucked up the ass sideways without KY and nothing will get done; nor will I get paid back any of the money I am owed for the the little shopping spree that happened. \u00a0I.

I am now an official &#8220;Black Pearl Girl&#8221; like it says in my header picture!!\u00a0<i></i>\u00a0I was the lucky winner (we all were, and just knowing Bree makes us winners) of a handmade earring holder &#8211; mine was &#8220;shot&#8221;, as Bree puts it (she\u00a0makes these out of wood and then airbrushes them) with the Black Pearl color. Our task for winning the contest was to do something inspiring or good or kind for someone else &#8211; again, the intertwining theme of kindness, which more of us need. My &#8220;entry&#8221; was that I would go to a local nursing home and to the NYS Firefighter&#8217;s Retirement Home, which is Hudson &#8211; very close to me &#8211; and get stories from men who had done &#8220;heroic deeds&#8221; and then write about them. My daughter actually showed me that I have a recorder on my phone I can use to record the conversations &#8211; I was excited! Bree ALSO said there was a little something extra in my package from her. It came today. Another amazing woman who knows me all too well. She has been to my home, and knows my love of &#8220;blingy&#8221; things, as well as my love of dragons. I have a large collection of all kinds of dragons &#8211; especially D&#8217;Artagnon, the very impressive ceramic one that takes up the entire top of my coffee table in the living room. He was reluctantly sold to me by a vendor at a Renaissance Festival, but I did promise him a good home.So imagine my surprise when I opened my earring holder, and a small package falls out, and in it are two little dragons popping out of their eggs, with a note stating &#8220;This goes next to your stand. The Guardians.&#8221; And my stand &#8211; my stand has my name on it in shiny letters, totally blinging it out for me as well. There was also a note enclosed, which I will show you. It encompasses the kindness thread throughout all three of these amazing people who have given me hope, made me cry, and made me loved like I have never felt before. I wish I could put into words (more than I have) but all I can say is Thank You. All three of you have given me a gift of love that I will remember for the rest of my life. And shown me that Kindness DOES exist in this world.\u00a0<i></i>\u00a0<i></i></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div><img alt=\"Photo\" src=\"https://scontent-b-atl.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/q77/s320x320/1394411_10152239154973835_810612872_n.jpg\" width=\"167\" height=\"125\" /></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div><img alt=\"Photo\" src=\"https://scontent-b-atl.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/q71/s320x320/1378327_10152239156193835_1104844979_n.jpg\" width=\"166\" height=\"222\" /></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div><img alt=\"Photo\" src=\"https://scontent-b-atl.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-frc3/q81/s320x320/1385626_10152239157248835_713172033_n.jpg\" width=\"167\" height=\"125\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div><a title=\"Like this\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/amebaby#\">Like</a>\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0<a title=\"Tell friends this post is important\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/amebaby#\" rel=\"dialog\">Promote</a>\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0<a title=\"Send this to friends or post it on your timeline.\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ajax/sharer/?s=22&amp;appid=25554907596&amp;p%5B0%5D=656408834&amp;p%5B1%5D=10152239157938835&amp;profile_id=656408834&amp;share_source_type=unknown\" rel=\"dialog\">Share</a></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div id=\"u_jsonp_2_2j\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jodi.ellwanger.johnson\">Jodi Ellwanger Johnson</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/marisa.algarin\">Marisa Algarin</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/nimbysep\">Bobbielyn Harrsch</a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/browse/likes?id=10152239157938835\" rel=\"dialog\">15 others</a>\u00a0like this.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>\n<div><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/barbi.simons\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net/hprofile-ak-prn1/c0.34.75.75/s32x32/59175_10151783159532935_1778645498_t.jpg\" /></a></div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/barbi.simons\">Barbi Simons</a>\u00a0Beautiful!</div>\n<div><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/amebaby/posts/10152239157938835?comment_id=34337561&amp;offset=0&amp;total_comments=3\"><abbr title=\"Monday, October 7, 2013 at 2:54pm\">Monday, October 7 at 2:54pm (14 hours ago)</abbr></a>\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0<a title=\"Unlike this comment\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/amebaby#\">Unlike</a>\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/browse/likes?id=10152239268883835\" rel=\"dialog\"><i></i>1</a><a>Reply</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>\n<div><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Mztrshdish\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net/hprofile-ak-prn2/s32x32/273791_1236456402_1505376759_q.jpg\" /></a></div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Mztrshdish\">Trisha Ramsey</a>\u00a0Really beautiful honey!

She mentioned a strand of crystals to me, and I immediately was drawn to them, and basically &#8220;needed&#8221; them to help me through my upcoming surgery (yes, I am into that energy stuff). So, she sold them to me for a steal, and then mentioned that she &#8220;threw in a little something extra.&#8221; I was intrigued, and I am a 4 year old when it comes to surprises. Well, she did. And she know me ALL TOO WELL!! A gorgeous (and I am assuming somewhat vintage) total Ame bling crystal earrings and necklace set! They are stunning!! The beads are everything I could have wished for and more &#8211; full of energy that is incredible, but the jewelry is just amazing.

I did not get the job, even tho I was way more qualified that the person that got it. After a few days, one of people who interviewed me called me back, said he really liked who I was a person, and I obviously had skills they needed (aka I could use a computer) and would I like a part time position? I had just gotten over a bad breakdown from having spent 3, almost 4 years doing an hour each way commute to work, and someone else raising my daughter. Loved the woman, but I never got to see DeDe&#8217;s first steps, hear her first words, potty train her &#8211; I was always working. So I took the job, and I could spend more time with DeDe. The school was like a cult. You either were a cult member (sheep) or you were not. If you made waves, you were sent to slaughter. Long story short, I spent 15 years of my life there never conforming to their cult like ways, always part time, always given excuses why I could never be full time, no tuition breaks even tho other people got them &#8211; nothing. I allowed it to happen. When I applied for disability, they said I would get about $700 a month. That won&#8217;t even cover my rent. If I had been full time (I worked 32 hours a week &#8211; 3 hours short of full time) I would have been okay with the disability. Someone asked DeDe to ask me to come to the fall festival today. I went looking for a fight. What I got was &#8220;OMG where have you been???&#8221; &#8220;OMG you look amazing!!&#8221; &#8220;OMG we will set you up with a schedule of who will take care of you &#8211; we will all chip in!!&#8221; Then the person who hired me so very long ago, who has been following me on here and my journey said to me that if I didn&#8217;t see that the goddess I always had been has shed the bad shell and is emerging, brighter and better and shinier than ever, and what good would it do to confront anyone? It can&#8217;t be changed &#8211; let it go. So I lost the hate and re-found the love of the people in that community who always did care. I can&#8217;t even put into words how I feel right now. Closure in one sense, but opening a new door and allowing help and love in, and doing new things, and becoming more of a part of a community I had forgotten. But no had forgotten me. At least, no one that mattered. There were a few snubs, but mostly &#8211; it was healing, it was amazing, and I am blessed yet again. I wish I knew how to draw. I really want to draw a picture of a wounded goddess emerging from a chrysalis, shining so brightly, ready for a new life. I physically hurt so bad from walking and standing so much, but I had the best Sunday I have had in a very very long time. And I feel so loved, and so blessed. People I wasn&#8217;t even friendly with who live in this town &#8211; &#8220;you let me know whatever you need we will do for you and take care of you and&#8230;.&#8221; &#8211; and someone told me let them, because people WANT to do that. I said okay. I&#8217;m going to be okay. And I am not angry anymore. I never did see any of the people I was going to.

You can&#8217;t really drive and read directions at the same time (well, I can&#8217;t &#8211; I can&#8217;t walk and think at the same time) so I whip into the parking garage and immediately realize it&#8217;s the wrong one. \u00a0I ask the man how to get where I am supposed to go. \u00a0He looks at me like the idiot I am, mumbles something, and I go off to find a parking space. \u00a0I drive around the maze a few times, find a spot and immediately lose all sense of direction (not that I have much to begin with when it comes to parking garages, lots, etc.). I then proceed to go in the opposite direction of where I want to be, and when I finally end up across the street at the hospital, I am on the other end of the complex from where I need to go. \u00a0I do what any person in the predicament would do &#8211; I burst into tears. \u00a0Say what you want about hospitals &#8211; Albany Med has some of the nicest people ever working there &#8211; I don&#8217;t care if it&#8217;s the chief of staff or a janitor. \u00a0Some poor lady took me by the hand, unlocked some secret passage, wound me through the employees only bowels of the facility, and finally got me somewhere near where I had to be. \u00a0I get to the room (I am now limping, and my right knee hurts &#8211; DANGER DANGER &#8211; and my left ankle is swollen over the sneakers I thought would be a good idea to wear. \u00a0I am only 10 minutes late, which is cool &#8211; I take a number (19), look to see where they are (14) sigh, and turn on my <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Kindle Wireless Reading Device, Wi-Fi, 6&quot; Display, Graphite - Latest Generation\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Wireless-Reader-Wifi-Graphite/dp/B002Y27P3M%3FSubscriptionId%3D0G81C5DAZ03ZR9WH9X82%26tag%3Dzemanta-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB002Y27P3M\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"amazon\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kindle</a>. \u00a0And my cell phone, even tho it was prohibited &#8211; texting doesn&#8217;t count, right?? \u00a0They have ONE person doing intake and she is obviously distraught. \u00a01/2 an hour later, someone else comes and things start to move. \u00a0I get the crying lady. \u00a0Her son&#8217;s best friend had just tried Molly for the first time at age 17 and had committed suicide. \u00a0She&#8217;s also pregnant. \u00a0I have a knack for getting info out of people, and just being a kind ear, so I listened for awhile, and she sent me back to my old seat, instead of in the cattle section. \u00a0Jennie texts me a picture of her engagement ring (finally!!!!!) &#8211; it could feed about 6 small countries for years, but I am thrilled for her and since it was a shape I wouldn&#8217;t chose for myself, my jealousy quotient was lower than expected. \u00a0They finally call me &#8211; it&#8217;s 11:30 now (really??) &#8211; vitals, weight (do I need to give you a urine sample? NO? \u00a0*runs to bathroom*) then into room for exam. \u00a0I am in pretty good shape, I brought my med sheet like a good girl, I mention my apprehension about THIS particular surgery (aka I am going to die) &#8211; the PA says this is not good. \u00a0I ask maybe I could have the really great anesthesiologist from my last operation in March? \u00a0She says hang \u00a0on, goes to find my chart somewhere, can&#8217;t read his name (I am now dying laughing because can you ever read a doctor&#8217;s writing???), so she goes to check after I describe him, finds his name on the list and says it&#8217;s important &#8211; I&#8217;ll request him. \u00a0I thank her profusely &#8211; he was very calming and very competent, if a bit blunt (&#8220;I have lost over 100 lbs!!&#8221; \u00a0&#8220;You can lose a few more, no?&#8221; *evil smile*). \u00a0But it doesn&#8217;t hurt that he looks something like this&#8230;<a href=\"http://amebaby.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/grigori.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1391\" alt=\"grigori\" src=\"https://amebaby.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/grigori.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So then the phlebotomist comes in and we have a great time discussing the fact that we are both 51 (she looked gooooooood!!!!!

The Celtic peoples, who were once found all over Europe, divided the year by four major holidays. According to their calendar, the year began on a day corresponding to November 1st on our present calendar. The date marked the beginning of winter. Since they were pastoral people, it was a time when cattle and sheep had to be moved to closer pastures and all livestock had to be secured for the winter months. Crops were harvested and stored. The date marked both an ending and a beginning in an eternal cycle. The festival observed at this time was called Samhain (pronounced Sah-ween). It was the biggest and most significant holiday of the Celtic year. The Celts believed that at the time of Samhain, more so than any other time of the year, the ghosts of the dead were able to mingle with the living, because at Samhain the souls of those who had died during the year traveled into the otherworld. People gathered to sacrifice animals, fruits, and vegetables. They also lit bonfires in honor of the dead, to aid them on their journey, and to keep them away from the living. On that day all manner of beings were abroad: ghosts, fairies, and demons&#8211;all part of the dark and dread. Samhain became the Halloween we are familiar with when Christian missionaries attempted to change the religious practices of the Celtic people. In the early centuries of the first millennium A.D., before missionaries such as St. Patrick and St. Columcille converted them to Christianity, the Celts practiced an elaborate religion through their priestly caste, the Druids, who were priests, poets, scientists and scholars all at once. As religious leaders, ritual specialists, and bearers of learning, the Druids were not unlike the very missionaries and monks who were to Christianize their people and brand them evil devil worshippers. As a result of their efforts to wipe out &#8220;pagan&#8221; holidays, such as Samhain, the Christians succeeded in effecting major transformations in it. In 601 A.D. Pope Gregory the First issued a now famous edict to his missionaries concerning the native beliefs and customs of the peoples he hoped to convert. Rather than try to obliterate native peoples&#8217; customs and beliefs, the pope instructed his missionaries to use them: if a group of people worshipped a tree, rather than cut it down, he advised them to consecrate it to Christ and allow its continued worship. In terms of spreading Christianity, this was a brilliant concept and it became a basic approach used in Catholic missionary work. Church holy days were purposely set to coincide with native holy days. Christmas, for instance, was assigned the arbitrary date of December 25th because it corresponded with the mid-winter celebration of many peoples. Likewise, St. John&#8217;s Day was set on the summer solstice. Samhain, with its emphasis on the supernatural, was decidedly pagan. While missionaries identified their holy days with those observed by the Celts, they branded the earlier religion&#8217;s supernatural deities as evil, and associated them with the devil. As representatives of the rival religion, Druids were considered evil worshippers of devilish or demonic gods and spirits. The Celtic underworld inevitably became identified with the Christian Hell. The effects of this policy were to diminish but not totally eradicate the beliefs in the traditional gods. Celtic belief in supernatural creatures persisted, while the church made deliberate attempts to define them as being not merely dangerous, but malicious. Followers of the old religion went into hiding and were branded as witches. The Christian feast of All Saints was assigned to November 1st. The day honored every Christian saint, especially those that did not otherwise have a special day devoted to them. This feast day was meant to substitute for Samhain, to draw the devotion of the Celtic peoples, and, finally, to replace it forever. That did not happen, but the traditional Celtic deities diminished in status, becoming fairies or leprechauns of more recent traditions. The old beliefs associated with Samhain never died out entirely. The powerful symbolism of the traveling dead was too strong, and perhaps too basic to the human psyche, to be satisfied with the new, more abstract Catholic feast honoring saints. Recognizing that something that would subsume the original energy of Samhain was necessary, the church tried again to supplant it with a Christian feast day in the 9th century. This time it established November 2nd as All Souls Day&#8211;a day when the living prayed for the souls of all the dead. But, once again, the practice of retaining traditional customs while attempting to redefine them had a sustaining effect: the traditional beliefs and customs lived on, in new guises. All Saints Day, otherwise known as All Hallows (hallowed means sanctified or holy), continued the ancient Celtic traditions. The evening prior to the day was the time of the most intense activity, both human and supernatural. People continued to celebrate All Hallows Eve as a time of the wandering dead, but the supernatural beings were now thought to be evil. The folk continued to propitiate those spirits (and their masked impersonators) by setting out gifts of food and drink. Subsequently, All Hallows Eve became Hallow Evening, which became Hallowe&#8217;en&#8211;an ancient Celtic, pre-Christian New Year&#8217;s Day in contemporary dress. Many supernatural creatures became associated with All Hallows. In Ireland fairies were numbered among the legendary creatures who roamed on Halloween. An old folk ballad called &#8220;Allison Gross&#8221; tells the story of how the fairy queen saved a man from a witch&#8217;s spell on Halloween. O Allison Gross, that lives in yon tower the ugliest witch int he North Country&#8230; She&#8217;s turned me into an ugly worm and gard me toddle around a tree&#8230; But as it fell out last Hallow even When the seely [fairy] court was riding by, the Queen lighted down on a gowany bank Not far from the tree where I wont to lie&#8230; She&#8217;s change me again to my own proper shape And I no more toddle about the tree. In old England cakes were made for the wandering souls, and people went &#8220;a&#8217; soulin'&#8221; for these &#8220;soul cakes.&#8221; Halloween, a time of magic, also became a day of divination, with a host of magical beliefs: for instance, if persons hold a mirror on Halloween and walk backwards down the stairs to the basement, the face that appears in the mirror will be their next lover. Virtually all present Halloween traditions can be traced to the ancient Celtic day of the dead. At Samhain the spirits of the dead sought the warmth of the fireside and communion with their living kin. This time was also known as <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"All Souls' Day\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Souls%27_Day\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">F\u00e9ile na Marbh</a> (the Feast of the Dead). As the veil between worlds thinned, all manner of spirits walked abroad at Samhain, including those of loved ones passed on. An empty chair by the fire was often left free along with a candle in the window to guide the ghost\u2019s home for comfort and seek their blessing for the coming year. In time the candle was placed inside a turnip lantern upon which a demon\u2019s face was carved to scare off unfriendly spirits. The tradition of wearing of costumes and masks at Samhain developed to deceive these same unfriendly spirits lest they recognised you and called you to the Otherworld before your time. Nervous living folk would attempt to appease the wandering spirit with gifts of fruit and nuts, which may be the origin of the ubiquitous treat or treating. Halloween is a holiday of many mysterious customs, but each one has a history, or at least a story behind it. The wearing of costumes, for instance, and roaming from door to door demanding treats can be traced to the Celtic period and the first few centuries of the Christian era, when it was thought that the souls of the dead were out and around, along with fairies, witches, and demons. Offerings of food and drink were left out to placate them. As the centuries wore on, people began dressing like these dreadful creatures, performing antics in exchange for food and drink. This practice is called mumming, from which the practice of trick-or-treating evolved. To this day, witches, ghosts, and skeleton figures of the dead are among the favorite disguises. Halloween also retains some features that harken back to the original harvest holiday of Samhain, such as the customs of bobbing for apples and carving vegetables, as well as the fruits, nuts, and spices cider associated with the day. Today Halloween is becoming once again and adult holiday or masquerade, like mardi Gras. Men and women in every disguise imaginable are taking to the streets of big American cities and parading past grinningly carved, candlelit jack o&#8217;lanterns, re- enacting customs with a lengthy pedigree. Their masked antics challenge, mock, tease, and appease the dread forces of the night, of the soul, and of the otherworld that becomes our world on this night of reversible possibilities, inverted roles, and transcendency. In so doing, they are reaffirming death and its place as a part of life in an exhilarating celebration of a holy and magic evening.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amebaby.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/samhain-fire.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image\" id=\"i-1405\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://amebaby.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/samhain-fire.jpg?w=310\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 1401, "location": false, "date": "10-31-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgQRkHcEyq8\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgQRkHcEyq8</a></p>\n<p>This Just Undid 2 Months of Therapy &#8211;\u00a0I don&#8217;t know how or why I stumbled across this today &#8211; why, why, why &#8211; but I sat here in stunned disbelief &#8211; I couldn&#8217;t watch him anymore &#8211; my eyes were too filled with tears, but my ears heard his words and my mind &#8211; OMG MY MIND &#8211; filled with the images he was reciting as they were done to others that I have read about, heard about and of course, what was done to me.

The only problem is, Andrew keeps talking about books Eddie hasn\u2019t read, that he can\u2019t read \u2014 at least not in the usual way \u2014 because Eddie\u2019s dyslexic.</p>\n<p>When the two men find Eddie\u2019s favorite teacher, Mrs. Henderson, wandering the school grounds confused and smelling of human decomposition, they come together to help her. Eddie\u2019s fiercely loyal, and this is the teacher who uncovered Eddie\u2019s learning disability and helped him regain his self-esteem. He\u2019ll do anything, even take on a massive cleaning job pro bono to pay Mrs. Henderson back for the support she\u2019s given him.</p>\n<p>Andrew and Eddie come from different worlds, Eddie can\u2019t read, Andrew can\u2019t dance. Andrew\u2019s father is a horrible snob and if all Eddie\u2019s secrets are laid bare, he\u2019ll have plenty to feel superior about.

We could\u2019ve worked it out if he was less attentive, more considerate and polished up on his communication skills.\u201d<br />\nSamira snickered, \u201cYou know most woman would kill to have a man who\u2019s attentive.\u201d<br />\n\u201cGood for them! They can have him. Eric wants to know where I am and who I\u2019m with at all times. I can\u2019t live like that. I had a father who already raised me and I\u2019m not looking for another one.\u201d<br />\nSamira chuckled. \u201cI bet you wished that fairytales would have warned you about guys like that.\u201d<br />\n\u201cYes, it would\u2019ve been nice. While you\u2019re in Africa, bring back a tall, tanned, muscle-bound hunk for me.\u201d<br />\n\u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do.\u201d<br />\nAmy laughed and hit her with a throw pillow she grabbed from the sofa. \u201cI\u2019m just glad the other person you were going to have as a roommate changed her mind. I needed to get away from him.\u201d<br />\n\u201cI\u2019m glad too. The last thing I need is some random person going through my stuff while I\u2019m not around.\u201d<br />\n\u201cDido, if I had to spend another day at Eric\u2019s place, I would\u2019ve lost my mind. He\u2019s too into me.\u201d Amy took a sip of her drink and put it on the accent table beside the sofa.<br />\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about me in regards to that. At least here, you\u2019ll get to keep your sanity.\u201d Samira eased back on the sofa.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amebaby.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/enchantress_of_books_blog_toursshine.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1572\" alt=\"Enchantress_of_Books_Blog_Tours.jpgshine\" src=\"https://amebaby.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/enchantress_of_books_blog_toursshine.jpg?w=300&#038;h=38\" width=\"300\" height=\"38\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 1554, "location": false, "date": "12-04-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p><img class=\"size-full\" alt=\"Shine\" src=\"https://amebaby.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/shine_cover_reveal_banner.jpg\" /><a href=\"http://amebaby.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/shine_cover_reveal_badge.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1569\" alt=\"Shine_Cover_Reveal_Badge\" src=\"https://amebaby.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/shine_cover_reveal_badge.jpg?w=227&#038;h=300\" width=\"227\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amebaby.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/shine500x800.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1570\" alt=\"SHINE500x800\" src=\"https://amebaby.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/shine500x800.jpg?w=196&#038;h=300\"   /></a></p>\n<p><b><i>Book Links:</i></b><br />\nGoodreads: <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13571899-gravity\">http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13571899-gravity</a><br />\n<b><i>Release Date:</i></b> December 20, 2013</p>\n<p><b><i>Author\u2019s Bio &amp; Picture:<br />\n</i></b> This is the segment where you learn a little more about who I am, so here&#8217;s what I can tell you: \u00a0I drink copious amounts of vitamin water placed precariously close to my laptop while writing. These are two healthy habits I have no intention of breaking. I&#8217;m a transplant living in the south, but I was born in the 70&#8217;s to a military dad who moved us around the world.</p>\n<p>When I&#8217;m not writing (which is all the time), I&#8217;m hunting down Indie music, watching movies, reading, eating Tex-Mex, discovering new ways to humiliate myself bowling, and burning up my laptop battery on the Internet. I have a relaxed, easy-going personality and don&#8217;t like drama. I live with a cat who thinks she is a dog, or a goat (she eats plastic, so I&#8217;m not sure which).</p>\n<p>Throughout my life, I&#8217;ve had insomnia. Counting sheep never worked and eventually I would imagine those sheep were the sole source of food after an apocalyptic battle where only thousands survived. I made up stories in a futile attempt to bore myself to sleep. The problem was, I got so wrapped up in my &#8220;head stories&#8221; that I would continue them through the following nights, changing it up each time to make it more exciting. Eventually, I started writing my ideas down &#8211; creating short stories, and then I discovered my love for poetry.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s almost embarrassing how many spiral notebooks and stacks of paper I have of poetry and lyrics.</p>\n<p>Another passion: digital art. I design all my book covers, marketing, and series art. I&#8217;m a very visual person and pursued photography as an avid hobby for many years.</p>\n<p>I am not a YA author (I feel like I have to state this only because I&#8217;ve had a few people ask), but I think it&#8217;s wonderful there are so many books available to teens in Urban Fantasy and Paranormal.</p>\n<p>I am finally doing what I have always wanted to do: giving my characters a pulse through writing full time. I focus on adult urban fantasy romance, but I don&#8217;t like labels and I enjoy blending genres to break out of the confines of predictability.</p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s what I love to do.</p>\n<p>Danni</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amebaby.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/mageri_series_bks_1-5.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1571\" alt=\"Mageri_Series_bks_1-5\" src=\"https://amebaby.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/mageri_series_bks_1-5.jpg?w=300&#038;h=92\" width=\"300\" height=\"92\" /></a><a href=\"http://amebaby.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/enchantress_of_books_blog_toursshine.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1572\" alt=\"Enchantress_of_Books_Blog_Tours.jpgshine\" src=\"https://amebaby.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/enchantress_of_books_blog_toursshine.jpg?w=300&#038;h=38\" width=\"300\" height=\"38\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 1567, "location": false, "date": "12-04-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Therapy"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://www.gocomics.com/momma/2013/08/31\" title=\"Emotions\">Emotions</a></p>\n<p>I have to start &#8220;talking&#8221; about my feelings &#8211; I don&#8217;t &#8220;talk&#8221; enough. \u00a0I told the shrink I could give her 1,000 other people who would disagree, but wrong kind of talk. \u00a0*eyeroll*\u00a0</p>\n", "post_id": 157, "location": false, "date": "09-02-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Jordana Brewster", "Fast and Furious", "Vin Diesel", "Skylar Grey", "Paul Walker"], "text": "<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/o8UCI7r1Aqw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></p>\n<p>I know I haven&#8217;t written a lot personally in awhile &#8211; just in a bad space. Stuck at home in this ridiculous wheelchair for 2 months, not being able to walk or drive or even take a damn shower by myself. So I have spared everyone the pity party and just remained silent. There are other things going on, too, that will impact my life severely in the next few months &#8211; I guess it will be the next chapter of my life. I don&#8217;t know. And the not knowing is tortuous. But I thank the powers every day I wake up that I am alive and have my daughter and at least for now, a place to live and food to eat.</p>\n<p>Paul Walker&#8217;s death hit me so hard &#8211; I still can&#8217;t believe he&#8217;s gone.

This video is amazing &#8211; it captures every bit of love from the entire Fast and Furious franchise.

This time he had his heart in his throat. He could feel the cold chill of trouble coming same as he could feel the thunderheads that gathered out over the ocean, ready to pound the Newport Sands Resort with relentless rain.</p>\n<p>Strings of Christmas icicles fluttered in the breeze along the edge of the RV\u2019s awning. At night, they were pretty, but right now, in the weak afternoon light, they were cheap bits of dirty plastic Gavin kept up all year round.</p>\n<p>He knocked again. \u201cGavin, it\u2019s me, Ringo. Open up.\u201d</p>\n<p>After a minute or so, the flimsy metal door opened a crack. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Bird?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBird? He\u2019s inside.\u201d Gavin opened the door the rest of the way, but didn\u2019t come down the steps.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t inside an hour ago when he ran into someone\u2019s RV after their cat.\u201d Ringo shook his head. \u201cGoddamn it, how many times do I have to tell you? You can\u2019t just let that dog out to wander around.\u201d</p>\n<p>Irritation played over Gavin\u2019s features. \u201cWhat\u2019s your damage, Ringo? So he pees on the grass. If he shits, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll pick up some other dog\u2019s shit sometime, as penance.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ringo folded his arms across his chest. \u201cSome lady from the As said Bird scared her grandkids. She was hysterical.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, well. If she\u2019s from the As then\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAw, Gav. Cut me some slack here, will you?\u201d Ringo leaned in. He wasn\u2019t above pleading a little. Gavin had more than once insinuated that the resort had different rules for people with better rigs or bigger wallets, which was bullshit. Everyone had to behave like they paid for a spot in the As. Ringo didn\u2019t ride Gavin for half the shit Bird got up to, but he was forced to respond when Bird caused a mess. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a trailer park, it\u2019s the Newport Sands Resort. These RVs are multimillion-dollar land yachts and the people expect to be able to open their doors without your dog charging inside. If Bird leaves this rig, you have to go with him. You take him out on his leash from now on, or you keep him in.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSir. Yes, sir.\u201d Gavin saluted smartly. \u201cNo letting Bird out off leash.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing personal. Management gets on me if they think I\u2019m not doing my job\u2014and they won\u2019t hesitate to have your ass and your rig hauled out of here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t just leave the form letter I normally get when someone from your security team sees Bird off leash?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ringo was too embarrassed to meet Gavin\u2019s eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t you just throw those away?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut nothing personal, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Christ, there was everything personal between them. Ringo felt it in his gut and his heart and his empty goddamn bed. They hadn\u2019t spoken in over a month and he\u2019d missed Gavin every single day. But that\u2019s not why he was here today. \u201cNo. Nothing personal.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf that\u2019s all then, I\u2019ll just haul my ass into my rig and\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLook.\u201d Ringo raked a hand over his buzzed hair. \u201cI don\u2019t know why you gotta be like this. You never heard anyone say, \u2018You can\u2019t fight city hall\u2019?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI hardly\u00a0<em>ever</em><i>\u00a0</i>let Bird run, only when it\u2019s absolutely necessary. And with it being Christmas, the park is half-empty anyway. You know people only say that city hall shit when the government is taking advantage.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou signed the lease. You know the rules. How is asking you to walk your own dog taking advantage?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNever mind. Message received and noted.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ringo sighed. \u201cWhy should the rest of us deal with Bird if you\u2019re too fucking lazy to do it? While you\u2019re wallowing, he\u2019s scaring off the tourists.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that what you think?\u201d Gavin eyed him sourly. \u201cI\u2019m wallowing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u00a0<em>think</em>\u00a0you need to walk your dog on a leash, like everyone else around here. What if you let Bird out and he eats something bad? Even a<i>\u00a0</i><em>lick</em>\u00a0of antifreeze could kill him. What if he gets into a fight with another dog? You need to think what your neglect could cost Bird, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ringo was about to turn away and leave when Gavin reached out and caught his arm. \u201cWait.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ringo took a step up toward Gavin. Even with another step between them, he was taller, especially since Gavin had a way of slouching lazily against his doorframe. His posture now was relaxed, and yet closed off.\u00a0<em>Typical</em>.</p>\n<p>Gavin sighed. \u201cI did let him go out alone this morning. I couldn\u2019t take him, so\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you mean, you couldn\u2019t take him?\u201d Ringo looked Gavin over closely and realized he didn\u2019t just look tired, he appeared to be in pain.</p>\n<p>Gavin grimaced. \u201cLook, it\u2019s nothing. Right now, I can\u2019t take him out, is all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait. What?\u201d Ringo asked. \u201cDid something happen? Are you sick?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not sick. I finally had to have my knee repaired. I stepped in a hole on the beach the other day and tore it again. The doc said I didn\u2019t have a choice anymore.\u201d Gavin looked anywhere except into Ringo\u2019s eyes. \u201cI figured I had some time off between Christmas and New Year\u2019s, might as well get it taken care of. But I just got home, and it\u2019s been tougher than I thought, and I\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJeez.\u201d<i>\u00a0</i><em>That\u2019s</em>\u00a0why Ringo had seen Gavin come home in a cab the day before.\u00a0<em>Christ</em>.\u00a0<em>Alone and hurting and you still won\u2019t ask anyone for shit.</em>\u00a0\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have told me that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy should I?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause I\u2019d have helped you. I\u2019d have taken Bird out for you, for one. At least I can ask one of the interns\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI had that Jules kid take care of Bird yesterday, but I thought\u2014\u201d Gavin chewed his lower lip \u201c\u2014I don\u2019t know what I thought.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJules is a good kid, but he\u2019s gone home until after New Year\u2019s. Do you want me to see if I can get a couple of the other kids to take shifts? They can walk Bird until you\u2019re well enough to do it yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gavin gave a reluctant nod. \u201cI\u2019d appreciate that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ringo sighed. \u201cGoddamn it, Gavin. I\u2019m only a phone call away. We\u2019re not seeing each other anymore, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t ask me for help if you need it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re surprised I didn\u2019t. We didn\u2019t work out because you always tell me I don\u2019t ask for enough.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ringo frowned at him. \u201cI thought it was because I wanted to give you too much.\u201d</p>\n<p>They stood nearly nose to nose. Ringo could smell the warm, smoky campfire scent of Gavin\u2019s skin, could feel desire building between them, even from that brief contact. But he couldn\u2019t make Gavin meet his gaze.</p>\n<p>He sighed. \u201cI didn\u2019t come here to autopsy us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot much left to dissect, is there?\u201d Gavin wrapped his arms around himself. Maybe he was cold, and maybe he needed holding. Ringo had a lousy habit of wondering what Gavin needed, as opposed to just giving him what he asked for, and Gavin hated it.</p>\n<p>God, Ringo wanted to hold him. He wanted to wrap himself around Gavin and never let go. How did everything between them always go to shit?</p>\n<p>Instead, Ringo said, \u201cGo back inside, you look like hell. I\u2019ll ask around, or I\u2019ll come back and walk Bird myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRingo\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t get your panties in a wad. Everybody has to learn to ask for help, just like every so often people ought to seek out someone who needs help and give it. It takes your mind off shit to look outside yourself for a change.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gavin snorted. \u201cThe Gospel According to St. Ringo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight.\u201d A gentle tease, instead of Gavin\u2019s customary porcupine spines. That was better. \u201cYeah. Well. Don\u2019t knock it until you\u2019ve tried it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve tried it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ringo ignored that. \u201cI\u2019ll be back later. I\u2019m assuming you have pain meds. What about food?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to infuriate you by checking on you every so often, and I\u2019m going to do it with hot meals. Just warning you ahead of time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRingo, don\u2019t make this a big deal.\u201d Gavin started back inside.</p>\n<p>\u201cGav\u2014\u201d Ringo reached for him, but he jerked away. \u201cDon\u2019t make me pull information out of you like this. I need to know. Please, if you need me, call me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd then what?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ringo shifted his weight from his right leg to his left. \u201cWhat do you mean, and then what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat would happen if I needed something?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d get you what you need. What do you mean what would happen?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat if I need to be left alone?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you really need to be left alone?\u201d Ringo asked. \u201c\u2019Cause the Gavin who plays his sax at midnight because he knows I\u2019ll have to come and tell him to knock it off\u00a0<em>loves</em>\u00a0my company. It\u2019s the Gavin who pushes me out of his bed before dawn the next morning and tells me I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSmothering,\u201d Gavin snapped. \u201c<em>Hovering</em>. Blocking the exits and taking up all my\u00a0<em>space</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>God, Ringo\u2019s shoulders ached. \u201cJust tell me what you need, Gav. What can I do for you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure you will.\u201d Ringo sighed. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gavin lobbed him his slow-pitch softball smile, round and a little wobbly. Ringo guessed that was the best he was going to get. \u201cSee you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Ringo nodded.</p>\n<p>Ringo wished Gavin would say more, like he was looking forward to it, or he\u2019d be glad for the company\u2014something Ringo knew was true, even if Gavin would rather die than admit it\u2014but if he waited for that, he\u2019d stand there forever.</p>\n<p>Instead, Ringo got in his golf cart and took off because it never paid to give Gavin even the gentlest squeeze. If Ringo squeezed, Gavin would slip through his fingers like a bar of soap, and they\u2019d end up back at square one.</p>\n<p><em>What do they mean by square one, anyway? Was that a reference to a game or the first stone on a path? The first bubble on the SATs or the first letter they turn on</em>\u00a0Wheel of Fortune?</p>\n<p>Ringo\u2019s square one was the very first time he\u2019d seen Gavin playing saxophone for the summer crowd at the picnic tables. He\u2019d looked like a young Carlos Santana in shades, with a mustache and a highly kissable soul patch. He\u2019d worn a weathered fedora.</p>\n<p>Gavin always wore a hat, but that was mostly because his hairline was receding. Ringo went along when Gavin pretended his hats were some kind of fashion statement. They were that too, from skull caps to stingy-brimmed straw fedoras to out-and-out wool felt mafioso lids, but Gavin kept his hair buzzed short and his head covered because he was vain about going bald.</p>\n<p>The first time Ringo had seen him, he\u2019d thought Gavin had stepped right out of the movies.</p>\n<p><em>Central casting, get me a Latino street musician.</em></p>\n<p>Ringo drove back toward his office, five miles per hour, waving at the tourists. Trying to look strong and silent. Reassuring, as if he were \u201cthe law\u201d in this here town.</p>\n<p>As if he were doing something besides pining for a guy who didn\u2019t want him around.</p>\n<p>His sister had warned him musicians were dogs, but Ringo had never listened.</p>\n<p>God knew, Gavin was a musician. To paraphrase Ringo\u2019s mother\u2019s favorite poem, music was the thing with strings that perched in Gavin\u2019s soul. Wherever Gavin went, he had to blow his horn or pick at his guitar or drum on the park benches and the trashcans with chopsticks. He bought instruments whenever he could, and he always had a half a dozen or so on his patio undergoing repairs. He was constantly tinkering with some broken guitar or refurbishing a brass instrument that needed a little TLC. He sold some on eBay, and some he got attached to.</p>\n<p>What he couldn\u2019t live without one day, he gave away the next.</p>\n<p>Ringo stopped to bag up some garbage that had blown off a picnic table, and even that reminded him of Gavin: give Gavin a milk carton, a plastic fork, and a couple of rubber bands, and you\u2019d get an entire symphony orchestra.</p>\n<p>Gavin had warm golden skin and cold brown eyes, and he lived in a crappy camper because it made him feel free. He didn\u2019t have to live like that; he\u00a0<em>liked</em>\u00a0it.</p>\n<p>He drank too much, and he laughed too loud, and when Ringo got near the cracks in the shell Gavin had built around himself, Gavin chased him away like a junkyard dog. Gavin had a miserable fucking temper. He could lash out.</p>\n<p>It hurt a lot to love a man like that.</p>\n<p>Especially when Gavin was always the center of attention and could pick and choose from any man around. He never kept any of his lovers for long; he didn\u2019t know how. He always seemed lonely to Ringo, even if he was rarely alone.</p>\n<p>Ringo had pried his way into Gavin\u2019s life through persistence and the judicious application of alcohol, and although they\u2019d washed out, they still kept company sometimes. Lots of times.</p>\n<p>Ringo always said that if he had it to do over again, he\u2019d do it over again.</p>\n<p>He pitched the trash he\u2019d policed into the Dumpster as he rode by.<i>\u00a0</i><em>Hole in one.</em></p>\n<p><em>Whoopee.</em></p>\n<p>That was probably his entire quota of \u201cwin\u201d for the day, the rest of which would be spent filing incident reports and making sense of client complaints. He was responsible for\u00a0<em>lost or stolens</em>, and there was one case of employee pilfering at the snack bar to deal with.</p>\n<p>When he got back to the office, he shut himself inside for the better part of the morning, until a knock sounded at his door.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jurgen, one of the interns, a college kid from Germany, entered and stood nervously in front of Ringo\u2019s desk.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou wanted to see me, sir?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ringo took off his reading glasses and rubbed his eyes. He was only thirty, but he couldn\u2019t read without glasses for shit. It made him wonder if he was going to be like his nana, with her bottle-bottom trifocals, when he got old.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know the guy who lives in the Cs over by the laundry room, Gavin Lopez?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe musician?\u201d Jurgen nodded. \u201cIs there a problem?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLittle bit. He\u2019s out of commission for a few days because he had to have some knee surgery. Would you mind walking his dog? I\u2019ll pay you, but don\u2019t tell him I said anything about money.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can do that.\u201d The kid spoke English well, with little to no accent, and he was respectful and polite. The smile he gave Ringo was unforced.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe if you went first thing when you get to work, at lunch, and before you leave?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure.\u201d Jurgen gave another bob of his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe dog\u2019s name is Bird. Let him run in the fenced off-leash area by the volleyball courts while you\u2019re at lunch. Otherwise keep him on a leash at all times. Give him some exercise; he\u2019s an energetic, curious pooch, so if he gets loose he\u2019s likely to wander into people\u2019s rigs.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jurgen smiled wryly. \u201cI can see how that might create concerns.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you know when to stop\u2014just a few days probably. You\u2019ll be here over the holidays, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ll be here. Is that all?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Once dismissed, Jurgen left. Ringo wondered what his story was, if he was studying for a career in hospitality, or if he just wanted to work in America for a while. The resort always had foreign interns as part of an exchange program with the local university. Whether they had aspirations to stay in the States, or just wanted a chance to work where they could surf and go to Disneyland and tour the beaches where\u00a0<em>Baywatch</em>\u00a0had been filmed, they came and went.</p>\n<p>Jurgen seemed like a nice kid. He\u2019d be good for Bird, and maybe Bird would be good for him.</p>\n<p>When Ringo made his rounds later, he saw Jurgen and Bird on the beach together, Jurgen running along the water and Bird bounding happily along beside him in puppylike high spirits when he wasn\u2019t busy chasing after sea birds. The sight warmed Ringo\u2019s heart. A boy and a dog could be a beautiful thing.</p>\n<p>He watched Jurgen play tug of war with Bird for a while, and then he continued on his rounds, making sure everyone was in their proper space. He liked to greet the campers and check in with the groundskeepers. He needed to make sure the empty cabins were locked up tight.</p>\n<p>Since the economy was still in the shitter and the price of gas was at an all-time high, some of the resorts streets echoed with emptiness. The holidays hadn\u2019t brought crowds to the resort the way they usually did, but they still had the die-hard snowbirds.</p>\n<p>The size of the population didn\u2019t matter, though. He had to keep security tight, and his crew had to stay dialed in to any potential problems so they could prevent mishaps or react quickly if they were needed.</p>\n<p>A case of illegally dumped trash was the most he had to deal with before he sat down at his desk again after lunch to write up incident reports. His security detail for the day, Gunn and Frisbo, patrolled the grounds together while he caught up on paperwork.</p>\n<p>Most days, their lives revolved around a series of small, inconsequential matters and the paperwork that went with them.</p>\n<p>Most days were dead boring, but it went with the job.</p>\n<p><em>Yessir, I am the sheriff in this here town.

Never saw such a white man before. Not around here. I stared at the deep dimples on his lower back near his waist band. Heat pooled in my stomach and I real-ized I should follow him. Halfway there, I stopped. \u201cYou mind if I take my shoes off? Kinda sounds like I\u2019m calling possums or somethin\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p>Before I could regret the stupid comment, his deep laughter strummed through me.<br />\n\u201cYou call possums?\u201d He shot a glance at me with that sexy half grin.</p>\n<p>Heat flooded my face. \u201cNah, not really.\u201d I slid off my sneakers and scooted them to the side with a foot then entered the shoebox-sized kitchen, shaped like a U.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot really?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean, no, of course not.\u201d I waved a hand, coming to stand at the island for two in the center.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt would totally be okay with me.\u201d He set two red mugs on the island\u2019s butcher block top and hit me with those eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cTotally?\u201d I managed to tease back. \u201cWhere you from anyway? You\u2019re obviously not from around these parts.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEh,\u201d he shrugged, \u201chere and there.\u201d</p>\n<p>I tore my eyes from his broad glowing chest and ran into his direct gaze. I quick-ly looked around the small kitchen. \u201cCan\u2019t believe what you\u2019ve done to this place. Re-ally nice.\u201d</p>\n<p>He turned to the sink and my eyes swerved back to his body. I watched the beautiful phenomena of rippling muscles in his arms and back as he got the pot ready for fresh coffee. I forced my attention to the pot. \u201cI love those aluminum drip pots.\u201d I managed to keep my voice between high and low but I couldn\u2019t manage keeping my eyes off his body.</p>\n<p>He glanced over his shoulder and my cheeks burned at being caught gawking. Again.<br />\nGood grief. I scratched my cheek and stared at the copper pots hanging above the tiny island. \u201cYou got yourself some nice cookware there.\u201d I nodded at them. \u201cDo they actually work?\u201d</p>\n<p>He set the pot on the stove, turned on a low flame then headed toward me with that smile that could possibly mean he thought I was a fantastic idiot. But at least a fun one. My body gradually tensed as he drew closer, already resisting that gravitational pull he had about him. Lord, standing there like he didn\u2019t affect me one bit was like holding up a mountain.</p>\n<p>\u201cI should get a shirt on.\u201d</p>\n<p>I choked out a gasp, horrified. Horrified that it was quite obvious to him how much he affected me. \u201cOh, pffft, not at all, you\u2019re fine,\u201d I said, making it clear that it was utterly unnecessary.</p>\n<p>He grinned. \u201cWell thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI meant, I\u2019m fine, as in, not bothered, it doesn\u2019t bother me, I see men all the time like that around here, everybody goes around in the summer time without shirts.\u201d I capped the lie with an overly exuberant laugh.</p>\n<p>\u201cEverybody?\u201d</p>\n<p>I met his teasing gaze and half grin. \u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d My voice dropped to its usual low tenor, aka my strong voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m Johnny.\u201d He reached a hand out to me.</p>\n<p>I tore my eyes from his and stared at his hand. I was suddenly very concerned over what touching this man would do to me. \u201cJewel.\u201d I placed my hand in his.<br />\nMy heart raced as he lifted it and pressed my knuckles to his soft, full lips. \u201cPer-fect name.\u201d</p>\n<p>His hot breath and lips on my fingers went straight to all those womanly places that I\u2019d barred every man from. I gripped his fingers, needing something to hold on to.<br />\nHe eyed me with wonder.</p>\n<p>I forced a disconnection, trying to appear unburned by his touch. But I failed miserably as I pulled back my hand with a series of embarrassing jerky hesitations. My lord, I\u2019d said more without words than I could or wanted to explain, and yet felt the need to.<br />\n\u201cJohnny, huh?\u201d It came on a squeaky whisper.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He lowered his head, and I glanced at him, trying to read his mind. He looked troubled, but about what and why, lord I wanted to know.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you have a middle name, Jewel?\u201d</p>\n<p>He spot-lighted me with liquid sapphire and my mouth opened without speech. \u201cUh, well, yeah, everybody has a middle name.\u201d I stroked my ponytail several times and tried to smile. \u201cPearl is mine. Jewel Pearl Harbor.\u201d I gave a light laugh. \u201cMomma and daddy never lacked a sense of humor.\u201d I realized I cared way too much about what he thought about my stupid name. Of course his face would grow so darn serious again. And mysterious. \u201cIt\u2019s uh, a family joke.\u201d I took a deep breath, feeling the need to level this playing field. \u201cWhat about you? What\u2019s your middle name?\u201d</p>\n<p>He turned from the island and answered me with his delicious backside. \u201cNo middle name. Just Johnny Blue.\u201d</p>\n<p>I averted my gaze as he turned with the coffee pot, barely managing to not get caught lusting. I watched the coppery liquid pour into the red ceramic. \u201cJohnny Blue? Well I think that\u2019s a very nice name. Is that why your favorite color is blue?\u201d</p>\n<p>He only gave a soft smile, keeping his attention on the cups. \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p>\n<p>I tossed a glance at the art studio. \u201cWell it\u2019s pretty obvious in those pictures over there, I think. I love them\u2014the colors I mean. And the pictures too, of course.\u201d</p>\n<p>He assaulted me with one of those electrical smiles while I\u2019d bumbled out the words, turning up the voltage as each word passed my lips. Whether he liked what I said, or thought I was hilarious, I wasn\u2019t sure, but more inclined to believe the worst.</p>\n<p>He slowly slid my cup of coffee to me then went to the counter behind him and returned with a tray. I smiled at the two white glass canisters with tiny green dragons painted on them. Adorable. He set them on the island between us. \u201cCream and sugar?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI uh- yeah, why not.\u201d I pulled the tray carefully toward me.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you trying to quit?\u201d His soft tone held humor.</p>\n<p>I glanced from him to the canisters, picking up the tiny silver spoon that went with it. \u201cNah, I just\u2026\u201d I removed the lid to the sugar and scooped two in my cup, try-ing to think. \u201cI normally drink it black, but, with dishes like this, I can\u2019t resist.\u201d I cleared my throat and picked up the creamer then promptly over-flowed my cup with it. \u201cOh lordy,\u201d I whispered.</p>\n<p>I looked around for a cloth and Johnny tossed me a napkin. I wiped it up, feeling like this whole thing was a long and painful audition that I was ruining. I gave a light laugh, bringing the mug of coffee to my lips. \u201cI\u2019ve always been a goofball.\u201d And to prove my point, I dribbled coffee down my chin.</p>\n<p>Johnny was just a watchin\u2019 the whole damn show and tossed me another napkin.<br />\nI forced out more light laughter. \u201cMight as well give me the whole stack, I\u2019m likely to need it.\u201d</p>\n<p>He slid the wrought iron napkin holder closer and I shot a glance at him. \u201cJust as you\u2019re likely to not get many visitors like me, I\u2019m likely to burn the place down.\u201d Like-ly, likely, don\u2019t you know any other words? I dabbed coffee off my chin and white t-shirt, then wiped the counter for extra measure all the while feeling the burn of those blue orbs on me.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt ain\u2019t nice to stare at the company, Johnny B.\u201d I took another sip of coffee, be-ing extra careful while avoiding his gaze.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re nice to stare at.\u201d</p>\n<p>The compliment undid the little composure I pretended to have and coffee sloshed out of my cup when I set it down too fast. \u201cMight as well dump the whole cup on the counter and get it over with,\u201d I mumbled, grabbing another napkin and shaking my head.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I paint you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOhhhh my lord,\u201d I breathed, fanning my face a little. \u201cPaint me? Like with paint?\u201d For some reason I thought he meant on my body, then it dawned on me he meant paint a picture of me. \u201cOh, I\u2014I\u2019ve never done anything like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMe either.\u201d</p>\n<p>I looked at him, surprised.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I mean\u2026\u201d he looked down. \u201cI haven\u2019t\u2019 in a very long time.\u201d</p>\n<p>That pressed my puzzle button. \u201cWell why start now?\u201d</p>\n<p>His brows drew together briefly. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re probably right, stupid idea.\u201d</p>\n<p>I immediately regretted my words. \u201cWell, I mean, I wouldn\u2019t call it stupid, I just ain\u2019t never had nobody want to paint me, it\u2019s kinda\u2026 I don\u2019t know, embarrassing, I guess.\u201d I stirred the little spoon in my cup loudly.</p>\n<p>\u201cEmbarrassing?\u201d Like he\u2019d thought it was something else and had never considered that.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell yeah, I\u2019m not used to people\u2026you know\u2026\u201d I tapped the spoon rapidly on the edge of my cup then returned it to the tray, \u201cstaring at me.\u201d</p>\n<p>I lifted my cup and took a sip in the fat silence.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p>\n<p>I was pretty sure that was relief I heard in that velvety voice of his. The idea that he might have his own inhibitions made me want to encourage him. \u201cI ain\u2019t never had nobody ask to paint me. But\u2026 if I was to be painted, I think you\u2019d be a\u2026 I mean, you\u2019re very nice and\u2026 it\u2019s just a picture for crying out loud.\u201d I laughed a little. \u201cI\u2019d love it if you painted me, why not. Only if you still want to, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>I worked up the nerve to look at him after several seconds of silence. Made no sense that I suddenly wanted to beg him to. But I did. Cause it felt like he\u2019d offered me a ride and I\u2019d turned it down, not realizing he was offering a ride to the moon.</p>\n<p>He suddenly walked toward me and as the distance closed between us, my heart sped up. He stood at my left shoulder and all I could do was keep my palms firmly on the counter, waiting, holding my breath, wondering what on earth he might say or do.<br />\nMy body tingled when he slid a finger along my face. Then spoke words that went further into my bones than words had a right to go. \u201cI do want to paint you. You\u2019re different.\u201d</p>\n<p>There was a raw need in his voice that lit a flame in me. A flame I had no idea how to control, didn\u2019t want to. I couldn\u2019t turn to him cause I could feel it. The insane urge to consume his lips right where he stood. Lord. How did this happen?</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I start tomorrow?\u201d His voice was so damn calm! It was unfair.</p>\n<p>My heart hammered my chest. Start? How long did it take? I nodded, only able to glance toward him, surely not at him. What must he be thinking? What a prude to be so undone over something so silly. It\u2019s not like I was stripping naked.</p>\n<p>My stomach jolted as naked bodies flashed in my mind, making lava leak from that volcano in my center. \u201cI\u2019d\u2026 I\u2019d really like that.\u201d And there it was, years of unmet need right there in my quiet answer. But all regret was erased when he whispered that thank you, next to my ear. I\u2019d never heard such emotions mixed in a tone. Joy\u2014mystery\u2014passion\u2014it was enough to make me swoon.</p>\n<p>I suddenly knew right then and there. I would let that man paint me however he wanted or needed. Clothed, nude, standing on my head, it didn\u2019t matter, the only thing that mattered was answering that need I\u2019d heard in \u201cI do want to paint you.\u201d Because really, to my ears, it sounded like, I do need to paint you.</p>\n<p>I followed his beautiful form as he went to the sink, turned, and placed both palms on the counter behind him. \u201cWhat time would you like to come?\u201d</p>\n<p>I tucked hair behind my ear wondering why the word come suddenly took on an erotic meaning. \u201cI get off work after supper time\u2014eight o-clock. If you don\u2019t mind workin\u2019 evenin\u2019s then\u2026that works for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>He stirred his coffee then put his spoon in the sink next to him. \u201cI love painting in the evening.\u201d</p>\n<p>I swallowed as every letter in his soft words slid through me and tickled places that had never been touched. Not like that.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo it\u2019s a date.\u201d He gave me a sexy half smile before sipping his coffee, all while masturbating my soul with those clear blue eyes.</p>\n<p>I focused on sipping my own coffee, wanting to vomit with excitement. \u201cYes, it sure is.\u201d</p>\n", "post_id": 1759, "location": false, "date": "02-06-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p><a title=\"Another free book from Azure\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Sessions-Covenant-Series-ebook/dp/B00EEPZ5HA\">Another free book from Azure</a></p>\n<p>This series by Azure Boone is probably my favorite. \u00a0I can&#8217;t WAIT until book 4 comes out!!!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amebaby.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/the-csessions.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1766\" alt=\"the csessions\" src=\"https://amebaby.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/the-csessions.jpg?w=300&#038;h=300\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Micah was enamored. Sarah was as beautiful as he\u2019d expect she\u2019d be in normal clothes. White casual shorts that went to her knees, modest of course, and a lavender silk top with a frilly collar, no cleavage. Her auburn hair was down and tucked behind her ears. It was just past her shoulders, as he\u2019d guessed. She always wore it up at the hospital and he\u2019d hoped, maybe even prayed, that she\u2019d wear it down for him. She had on little makeup, just enough to accentuate her natural beauty and it was all he could do to not sit and stare at her. She was putting on a superb act all for him, despite her clearly being nervous. For him, she could surpass any fear, any inhibition. And that was a total turn on in every possible way.</p>\n<p>After dinner, she led him to \u201cthe office\u201d which turned out to be her back patio on the third floor, scented candles\u2014cedar and sandalwood, he was sure\u2014a plastic table with a bowl of pinecones and two chairs.

I like being on top.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOhhh okay.\u201d She bit her lip and looked down.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t mean that the way it sounded.\u201d Though yes, he did.</p>\n<p>\u201cMeet any neighbors?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sex was definitely not a topic she was going near in any shape or form. Yet. \u201cYes, I met the woman right next to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh? Tell me about her.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s not much to tell yet. She\u2019s nice. Helped me organize a few things.\u201d Micah looked at her, wanting to smile at how well she didn\u2019t hide her troubled expression. \u201cIs that\u2026a bad thing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh! No, not at all. Just be careful, okay? The world is full of\u2026danger.\u201d</p>\n<p>He looked down, smiling. \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you catch her name? I mean I may know her. Been here\u2026quite a while.\u201d She laughed a little, still not hiding her disapproval very well.</p>\n<p>\u201cI probably shouldn\u2019t have opened myself up to strangers so soon.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAbsolutely not. You did well, don\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHer name was\u2026I\u2019m bad with names. I think Tammy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh. Hm. Can\u2019t say I know a Tammy. So you got settled in okay? When do I get a tour?\u201d</p>\n<p>He shrugged. \u201cNever maybe.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, that\u2019s fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>He was amazed to hear it hurt her feelings. That he let a perfect stranger over and not her. \u201cI was joking. You can come over whenever you want. Maybe call first so I can at least pretend I\u2019m not a slob.\u201d</p>\n<p>She smiled knowing he was as OCD as they came, but he noticed it lacked the bubbly warmth. Would she ever fully recover from the other woman announcement? He also wondered why exactly that bothered her so much. He was almost sorry he\u2019d told her but at the same time, desperate to know every reason for this reaction. Possessive he hoped. Fixated even better.</p>\n<p>She angled her head, a question on her beautiful face. \u201cYou know, somebody forgot to enter your date of birth into the files and I\u2019m trying to recall how old you are exactly.\u201d<br />\nHe studied her a bit, wondering. \u201cI\u2019m thirty-two. And you are?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cSorry, I suppose that\u2019s not my business.\u201d</p>\n<p>Her face scrunched with cute indifference, \u201cNo, it\u2019s fine, it\u2019s just age, not a huge deal.\u201d And yet she bit her lip and wagged her foot rapidly. \u201cI\u2019m thirty-five.\u201d</p>\n<p>His cock twitched at this discovery. Another vulnerability. She could never have too many with him. She clearly saw herself as beyond the dating age. A true blue spinster woman. A comical concept with her rare beauty.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look thirty-five.\u201d</p>\n<p>She laughed a bit louder than normal. \u201cWell\u2026thank you. You certainly don\u2019t look your age either. You mentioned once you had a brother, I believe.\u201d</p>\n<p>Therapy time.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d She knew he didn\u2019t want to talk about it. But the therapist in her insisted.<br />\n\u201cIs he older than you? Younger?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s younger. And dead.\u201d</p>\n<p>Brief silence and then a silky, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>His cock jerked again. It did that a lot with her. The depth of emotion he heard in those words was erotic for him, fascinating even. \u201cIt\u2019s been a very long time. He died when he was four.\u201d</p>\n<p>She was silent but he knew she wanted details. She\u2019d have to work harder for those.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have siblings?\u201d he asked.</p>\n<p>She cleared her throat a little. \u201cI have four. I\u2019m the youngest.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWow. That\u2019s a lot. I was an only child after my brother.\u201d He hoped she got the hint that he\u2019d like an information exchange. Patience was definitely one of her virtues. But then it was one of his as well.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow about I tell you a little about myself?\u201d</p>\n<p>Micah smiled at the unexpected treasure. He turned in his chair and scooted to the table, mostly to hide his hard on. \u201cI would love that.\u201d Utterly true. She had taken his information exchange bait, and was being honorable by going first. He already knew what he\u2019d tell her when it came time to sharing.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I had a normal life, maybe even boring by some standards. My mom was a regular Betty Crocker\u2026too bad it didn\u2019t rub off on me. My dad was a philosopher and doctor. He loved William James.\u201d She smiled fondly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI see who you took after.\u201d He felt like a young boy at an amusement park for the first time.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d She bit her lip, still grinning while delving into her beautiful shoe box of innocent memories. \u201cI loved playing in my dad\u2019s office. The smell of books was just\u2026wow, I still love the smell.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo do I.\u201d</p>\n<p>She bit her lip again, flashing a look his way. His arousal had colored the words and she\u2019d caught it. So perceptive. He wondered why she looked at him though. To see him in that emotion?</p>\n<p>\u201cMy mom was forever chasing after me to be girly and I hated it. We were three boys and two girls, and apparently my sister just before me stole all the girly genetics from my mom and she had none left to give me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Micah laughed out right at that. \u201cYou seem to have grown into your girlie, I think.\u201d</p>\n<p>The surprise on her face, or adamant disbelief, crimped her forehead. \u201cI\u2019m so not girlie.\u201d</p>\n<p>He chuckled and lowered his head a bit. \u201cOkay. You\u2019re not girlie.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not! I\u2019m not into fancy clothes or make up, or jewelry. I even hate shopping!\u201d She seemed desperate to prove her delusion.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, if that is your definition of girlie, then you\u2019re right. You\u2019re not girlie. I thought you meant something else.\u201d</p>\n<p>She seemed to relax a little. \u201cI mean I know I look like a girl,\u201d she muttered, fishing for him to elaborate.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re free to believe what you want about yourself,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine, tell me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTell you what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is your definition of girlie.\u201d</p>\n<p>He shrugged a shoulder. \u201cI said you grew into your girlie. And I meant you became a beautiful woman.\u201d</p>\n<p>Her reaction was one for the books. He\u2019d never seen her look so shocked. \u201cPlease doc, you\u2019re far too intelligent and perceptive to not be aware that you\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she conceded too casually. \u201cIt is rather thick of me to not be aware of my beauty. I can\u2019t tell you how often I\u2019ve been called the blind professor. And with all the guys knocking down my door, how could I miss it? And me being single, well, that sort of just slaps me in the face with it, just amazing that I\u2019ve managed to miss your delusion.\u201d</p>\n<p>Micah had to laugh. \u201cSo, because I think you\u2019re beautiful, I\u2019m delusional?\u201d He loved being able to say I think you\u2019re beautiful to her face and yet not.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, stop, enough. And I guess you know how gorgeous you are.\u201d</p>\n<p>Micah shifted in his seat readjusting his hard on. Was she playing? Did she really think that?</p>\n<p>\u201cI assure you, in a matter of days, you will have every woman knocking at your door,\u201d<br />\nshe knocked on the table for emphasis. \u201cI, on the other hand, have been living here for seven years and have had zero men, aside from maintenance, knock on my door.\u201d</p>\n<p>He was shocked and thrilled. \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault they\u2019re blind.\u201d</p>\n<p>She became animated in her frustration. \u201cOh hell, forget it, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re blind to whatever it is they apparently see or don\u2019t see.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re glad?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs in, for your sake, I could care less if you think I\u2019m beautiful or hideous, that is hardly the point of our relationship.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh. Yes, you\u2019re right.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWould you like some coffee? I\u2019d like a cup, I\u2019ll bring you some.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d</p>\n<p>Micah watched her hurry off, unable to contain his grin. He\u2019d never seen her so flustered. What he\u2019d give to feel what was going through her head in that moment.</p>\n", "post_id": 1764, "location": false, "date": "02-06-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["nys", "fall"], "text": "<p>Someone asked &#8220;What do you love most about Autumn?&#8221; \u00a0Huh. \u00a0How to put that into words&#8230;.</p>\n<p>The SMELL of upstate New York &#8211; fires in fireplaces, apples, leaves, the crisp air &#8211; the COLORS up here are magnificent, as though Mother Nature herself is doing one last fashion show before retreating to return again as the wheel turns once more.

Yes *continues writing*). \u00a0Okay. \u00a0O.o</p>\n<p>DeDe and set out for the B&amp;B on Saturday morning instead of Friday night, because basically, I couldn&#8217;t get my shit together, and any excuse to put this off longer was fine by me. \u00a0We left at 8:30, which was a miracle to begin with, seeing as how I am never ready that early. But after a stop at Cumby&#8217;s for coffee for her and water for me, we were on our way. \u00a0One more stop at a Stewart&#8217;s in Duanesburg (maybe) for food and more coffee, and back in the cat. \u00a0I guess I subconsciously on purpose missed the turn off for my old house, so we ended up going to 80 and turning left. \u00a0We&#8217;re driving, and I am like where the hell is this place? \u00a07 tenths of a mile on the right? \u00a0Uh no dude &#8211; more like 2 miles, but whatevs. \u00a0Pull up &#8211; I FREAK. We are smack dab in the middle of Springfield Center &#8211; the same town I spent 2 of the worst years of my life in. \u00a0I start eating Ativan like skittles &#8211; no not really, because DeDe was watching me like a fucking hawk. \u00a0We get inside &#8211; really beautiful B&amp;B &#8211; my mother is gone for a walk, no one can find Nancy or the room key &#8211; it&#8217;s getting later and later &#8211; I am having MAJOR panic attacks. We find Nancy, get into the room with a master key &#8211; gorgeous room (totally forgot to take pix like an idiot) &#8211; in waltzes my mother who swears she doesn&#8217;t have the key until it miraculously appears out of her pocket. \u00a0*eyeroll* I then have to hear about how they wanted this room, but they took the one upstairs with the two beds because of my legs. \u00a0SORRY my legs are fucked up!! We get ready &#8211; DeDe is watching some flesh eating parasite show on tv &#8211; I am trying not to mainline the Ativan &#8211; she glues my eyelids shut getting on my lashes, we finish &#8220;gussying up&#8221; and off we go for the pictures. \u00a0Of course the directions are incomplete &#8211; not wrong &#8211; just incomplete, so we are a little late, but it doesn&#8217;t seem to matter. \u00a0My stepfather doesn&#8217;t even recognize me (thanks, Johnny &#8211; really??), LJ looked beautiful &#8211; I will give her that, altho I REALLY wanted to do her makeup. \u00a0I go sit in a chair after being introduced around, blah blah (LJ&#8217;s sister is a beotch and a 1/2 &#8211; do not know why, but I smile and look pretty). \u00a0My mother gets her pic done with my bro and my stepfather, more talking, then time to go to the ceremony. \u00a0WHY WAS I THERE?? \u00a0I corner my brother and ask &#8211; he says because he loves me and I love him and he wanted me there. \u00a0Okay. \u00a0I can do that. \u00a0Off we go to the wedding site. \u00a0Discussions ensue on how to get me down to the lake front &#8211; I don&#8217;t know what happens, but I get down there in my car (I think?) and walk the rest of the way. \u00a0I immediately want more Ativan but I promised, so no. I see a few people I know and love and hugs ensue and OMG&#8217;s I haven&#8217;t seen you in 40 years your daughter looks just like you did (haha DeDe take that x100!!!!) and I see Barbara Michaels who knows me first, but it took me a second &#8211; 1/2 hour later and many more OMG&#8217;s and &#8220;Who is that&#8221; the ceremony begins. \u00a0It was nice &#8211; I guess &#8211; LJ asked for no rain, so it spritzed a few times, and there were rumbles, but no rain. Okay &#8211; good job Mother Nature. \u00a0Short, \u00a0religious ceremony (really??) and they are married. \u00a0I don&#8217;t even know if I got any decent pix &#8211; have not even had time to look, let alone unpack except for perishables and necessities. \u00a0Time to eat. \u00a0Cute\u00a0\u00a0seating arrangements &#8211; bad way to do a buffet &#8211; so I ended up having people get stuff for me, which I dislike. \u00a0People&#8217;s names were on a piece of paper with a header and their name at the bottom and a peacock feather (wedding theme that I didn&#8217;t know about because I wasn&#8217;t invited to the bridal shower &#8211; bad bad bad &#8211; you do NOT not invite the groom&#8217;s only blood relative besides his mother). ANYWAY &#8211; you are supposed to write something down and LJ can have them for her scrapbook. \u00a0Cute. \u00a0Ate a little, nice music, more talking &#8211; no &#8220;real&#8221; animosity or tensions, which was nice &#8211; I was expecting more, especially since my stepfather&#8217;s wife was NOT at the picture taking event, which I thought was odd. \u00a0She finally came over and chatted &#8211; it was getting late, I wanted to go &#8211; Ame wait for the cake and shit &#8211; okay &#8211; had cake, speech, DeDe won&#8217;t go catch bouquet, whatever, my stepfather breaks down doing his speech and I lose it. \u00a0The ONLY time I cried the whole day. \u00a0Have cake, talk more, don&#8217;t correct stepfather when he makes several mistakes talking to me and Deedles &#8211; I HAVE to leave. \u00a0Convince her to stay &#8211; she&#8217;s 21, she should have fun &#8211; my mother, Nancy and I go back to the B&amp;B &#8211; they go for ice cream &#8211; I whip out the laptop and end up face first on the bed diagonally &#8211; passed out.

If they are good friends, they&#8217;ll be willing to listen and give you an honest perspective or the benefit of their life experience. That&#8217;s what friends do for each other.</p>\n<p>You are lucky to be vital and active, because it means your world doesn&#8217;t have to shrink any more than you want it to. Because you say you&#8217;re lonely, perhaps it&#8217;s time to consider enlarging your circle of acquaintances.</p>\n<p>The loss of your sister is probably what started your re-evaluation of your life and choices, and that&#8217;s normal. But please remember that regret is the cancer of life. You can&#8217;t change the past, and you mustn&#8217;t allow it to cloud your future. While you may be having second thoughts about choices you made when you were younger, the lessons you learned from them have made you the person you are today.</p>\n<p>DEAR ABBY: I think our culture is severely lacking when we don&#8217;t teach our children how to politely and non-aggressively stand up for themselves when the need arises. People suffer in all sorts of relationships &#8212; work, family, friends &#8212; because they&#8217;re afraid of confrontation. Raising a subject that may be embarrassing and risking angering someone isn&#8217;t fun, but it&#8217;s\u00a0<i>communication.</i></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><i></i>If you have a problem, large or small, address it in private with the individual. And if someone tries to talk to you about something you&#8217;d rather not hear, be an adult, listen and respond civilly instead of reacting childishly.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We teach children to respect authority, be kind to others and be leaders &#8212; but we don&#8217;t teach them healthy confrontation, which is something we all encounter in our lives. &#8212; TALKING IT OUT IN INDIANA</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>DEAR TALKING IT OUT: I agree with you. The kind of communication you&#8217;re describing is a skill. It requires not only a strong ego on the part of the &#8220;confronter,&#8221; but also tact and diplomacy. And the &#8220;confrontee&#8221; needs to have the ability to listen without responding with hostility to what is being said.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "post_id": 21, "location": false, "date": "08-27-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>I am BIG into horoscopes. \u00a0I read about 4 a day. \u00a0I always have &#8211; I don&#8217;t know why. \u00a0But it helps me.

He skidded on wet leaves and went into a tree.\u00a0</span></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">\u00a0</span></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">He ended up all kinds of fucked up and tried to kill himself and the police were involved, blah blah &#8211; I got him into a treatment center, but he ended up with <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Electroconvulsive therapy\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroconvulsive_therapy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">electro shock therapy</a>. It really fucked him up. He came to live with me, but my mother didn&#8217;t like that because I was still drinking at the time, and she and his father both thought/denied there was anything wrong with him except booze. \u00a0Um &#8211; you don&#8217;t give electroshock therapy to alcoholics. She came and &#8220;kidnapped&#8221; him one day while I was at work, and I didn&#8217;t talk to her for 8 years or so &#8211; I have just recently started talking to her.\u00a0</span></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">\u00a0</span></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">He is getting married this weekend. To a woman I thought was okay, but turns out isn&#8217;t. I can tell you more later, but I don&#8217;t want to go, I don&#8217;t want to see her, my step father, his now wife, her daughters, etc. I don&#8217;t want to go to <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Cooperstown, New York\" href=\"http://www.cooperstownny.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"homepage\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cooperstown</a> where one of the worst times in my life happened (1972-74). I have been stressing this for MONTHS. \u00a0She even told me I couldn&#8217;t wear my normal black to the <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Wedding\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">wedding</a> (I ONLY wear black) and I guess my brother got pissed, cause she recanted, but I got a really pretty dress that&#8217;s black and blue, which is what I want to do to her face.\u00a0</span></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">\u00a0</span></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">Anyway, I get another email from her saying we need to be out there an hour away from the wedding site, which is 2 hours away to begin with for 10 minutes worth of pictures and I lose it. I have been dieting to look nice, and Friday night I had to poop and couldn&#8217;t and ended up having to help myself and finding out first hand (and it was my hand) how people have anal sex. Once the block unblocked, what came out of me was unreal. \u00a0I was a mess &#8211; mentally, physically (I was bleeding, etc.). I went to bed, woke up the next morning, had an accident, had to call DeDe who gave me tude, which I didn&#8217;t need, and I slept most of the weekend. I was really sick. \u00a0Everyone said don&#8217;t go to the wedding, but I SWORE to my bro I would go. Monday I called my doc, who had been on vacay and made an app&#8217;t., but I was not connected to my body &#8211; my head was somewhere, my body was doing stuff by remote control. I got scared. I called my doctor back, they said call 911. I called 91DeDe. They took me to the ER, and it took me up to 1/2 hour before I talked them into letting me go instead of keeping me to realize I was in the psych ward part of the ER. \u00a0I have some problems. \u00a0I don&#8217;t &#8220;talk&#8221; enough. I said I could give them the names of 1000 people who would disagree with that, but I need to talk about &#8220;stuff&#8221;. So. I go to the doctor tomorrow, I get my drugs re-evaluated, I get some <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Lorazepam\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorazepam\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">Ativan</a> and I go to the wedding. \u00a0Then I have to go to therapy.

I don&#8217;t think he has a whole lot of confidence in me&#8230;yet, judging by the Daniel Boone back to basic whirlwind he&#8217;s on.</p>\n<p>He&#8217;s saving electricity in various ways&#8230;.he shuts the washing machine off and agitates the clothes by hand saving a whopping .0006 cents a load. He hangs the clothes outside and I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s a considerable savings. But he doesn&#8217;t\u00a0hang them on a clothes line, he hangs them on the kid&#8217;s tree house. The clothes are so stiff, they stand on their own in the closet.</p>\n<p>The latest is, we&#8217;re looking into morally questionable &#8220;free wi/fi&#8221; via a cantena. There&#8217;s talk of using the swimming pool as a water cistern to collect rainwater and use for flushing toilets. After all, the water bill accounts for half of the electric bill since the outrageous sewage charges are tacked onto that. But I&#8217;m more than happy to pay somebody to clean up everybody&#8217;s shit, you feel me?</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll be sleeping without AC because the fans do a fine job of keeping us cool at night. That was my suggestion. (yes, i&#8217;m playing along, so that when i say no to something that I&#8217;m not willing to part with, I won&#8217;t be seen as illogical and uncaring)</p>\n<p>During the day, there&#8217;s a huge picture window at the front of the house that he&#8217;s discovered is acting as a heater in the summer time. So, he&#8217;s hung up two unmatching blankets outside the window to block the heat. Looks Jethro, but works. I said, &#8220;wow, two unmatching blankets.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, as soon as the sun reaches twelve, they roll up and sit in the attic.&#8221; This is possible from the soffit that he&#8217;s removed to allow the heat to escape the attic.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m praying he doesn&#8217;t think of using the pool as a community bathtub that can be filtered for drinking. I have divorce papers on standby. Let&#8217;s hope it doesn&#8217;t come to that.</p>\n<p>Update on husband&#8217;s operation CONSERVE ENERGY</p>\n<p>Okay, so, I&#8217;m working late in my office because I have to win bread for the family now. I worked into the evening until it became a dire emergency that i get to the bathroom ASAP.</p>\n<p>I RUN into the house, flip on the hall light&#8230;only it doesn&#8217;t come on. I hurry into the bathroom and hit the light switch, NO LIGHT. What the fuck? I&#8217;m dancing and I reach toward the mirror in suspicion to feel where the fluorescent bulb should be only they&#8217;re NOT. oooooookay Daniel fucking Boone.</p>\n<p>I hurry out that bathroom and into the one just next to it. Light works! I move at warp speed and notice the top of the toilet is off just as i sit to REEEEEEELIEVE myself thank you Jesus. After I&#8217;m done, I finally have a look to see what the helll he&#8217;s up to with the toilet.</p>\n<p>Holy. Shit. The back of the toilet is nearly FULL of bricks. I flush it and watch as the water goes out and the toilet flushes normally. As the water fills back up, I figure out what he&#8217;s done. He&#8217;s cut our water usage in half with the toilet. I giggle because I think it&#8217;s both hilarious and CLEVER. I wash my hands and am relieved to see we still have this privilege.</p>\n<p>I go into our bedroom and turn on the light only it doesn&#8217;t turn on. &#8220;Why are all the lights not working?&#8221; I ask.</p>\n<p>He flicks on a flashlight and I frikn loose it and give into fits of laughter. I say, &#8220;Everybody gets a flash light for each room at night?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;The lamps still work,&#8221; he says, serious as shit.<br />\n&#8220;What are you doing with the AC on, wasting all this electricity?&#8221;<br />\n&#8220;It was hot, I&#8217;m just cooling it off then using the fan.&#8221;<br />\n&#8220;Well, you&#8217;d better damn well.&#8221; More hysterical laughter from me.</p>\n<p>What will he come up with tomorrow?</p>\n<p>&#8220;Dear God. Please help me sell lots and lots of books so I don&#8217;t have to divorce my husband. Amen.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Saturday!! 9/7 &#8211; 4:06</p>\n<p>Cashing in on that prayer I prayed for God to remind me of how sweet my husband is the next time he&#8217;s an asshole. That didn&#8217;t take long.</p>\n<p>So we&#8217;re figuring out how many gallons of water we use in the new brickfilled toilets. Turns out 2.5 gallons is all it takes as opposed to the 5 it was using before, older toilet. Multiply that times the amount of people in the house times the average amount of times each uses the toilet then you have the amount of gallons of water you need a day to flush the toilet.</p>\n<p>Now, we have to figure out how big of a cistern we need to build JUST for flushing the toilets. Well, turns out a 4ft. deep by 8ft wide by 4.6 feet high would hold enough water to flush the toilets for 7 days.</p>\n<p>&#8220;But how much water can we collect off of our sized roof with gutters, shouldn&#8217;t we figure that out? If it rained for 15 minutes once a week, what would that give us?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Well, we can figure that out, but I mostly need to know how many gallons it takes a day and what size cistern would hold that for a weeks supply.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I think I follow? Part of me thinks if we knew the rainfall average first though, would help us decide less days, smaller container. But we are erring to the worse case scenario.</p>\n<p>But he wants to go outside to figure out where we might put something the size we&#8217;ve come up with. Fine. After measuring it out, I&#8217;m not liking it. &#8220;That&#8217;s too big, I don&#8217;t want a giant structure on the outside of the house like that. Plus if we need it by the bathroom for gravity feed, it&#8217;s going to block the windows.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Well we don&#8217;t have to put it in front of the windows, we&#8217;re designing it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Okay,&#8221; I say.</p>\n<p>Wasps suddenly come out of the greenery where we&#8217;re measuring. I quickly run backward. &#8220;Wasps!&#8221;</p>\n<p>He steps back, &#8220;It&#8217;s fine.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m 20 feet away by then thinking, ummmm no it&#8217;s not.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Okay so go inside and tell me what the level of the toilet is at.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I look at him. &#8220;Why am I doing that?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;So we can figure out how high it needs to be.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t get what you&#8217;ve decided on the too big problem.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He shows signs of frustration. Signs he&#8217;s likely not aware he&#8217;s showing. But I&#8217;m aware.</p>\n<p>He basically does the repeat thing that doesn&#8217;t really help me understand any better. &#8220;But how is that going to fix the hugeness.&#8221;</p>\n<p>And this is where we became like 2 kids.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to build it and throw it up on the wall right now.&#8221; This is said incredulously with him demonstrating the whole throwing it on the wall part.</p>\n<p>My button is pushed.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Okay, calm down. Don&#8217;t talk to me like that. I don&#8217;t understand what you&#8217;re doing and i have the right to ask until i do, you can like it or not, but that&#8217;s what i&#8217;m doing.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Exasperated head shake at me. Clearly I&#8217;m being unreasonable and don&#8217;t know it. &#8220;I explained it to you&#8211;&#8220;</p>\n<p>&#8220;and I didn&#8217;t understand and so I ask questions and you start acting like i&#8217;m stupid.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;No, you act like I&#8217;m stupid.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yes because you act like I&#8217;m stupid, you start it, you just don&#8217;t see it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>We both head back in the house because our little conservation project is officially on hold now.</p>\n<p>He says, &#8220;You&#8217;re the one who starts it and you don&#8217;t see it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;No, I see when I do it, I do it right after you.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Fuck you.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;No, fuck you!&#8221; This just before I walk in the house and assume my motherly personality.</p>\n<p>He gets in the car and leaves. The great escape. Must be great to be able to do! And a real gas saver!</p>\n<p>I put on lunch. Chicken and sausage gravy again. Baked beans, navy beans, smothered potatoes and sausage with onion. And rice.</p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n<p>Sept. 9th</p>\n<p>My poor 8 year old comes to me today, looking for a job. I tell her maybe she can be my assistant. She says &#8220;Yes, i can get you things and clean your office and rub your shoulders.&#8221; That last bit brought a smile to my face. I really like the sound of this. &#8220;Okay, so how much pay do you want?&#8221; She says, &#8220;Oh for free.&#8221; I say, &#8220;you can&#8217;t do all that for free. What do you think would be fair?&#8221; She says &#8220;Oh, I guess one dollar a week.&#8221; Poor child. &#8220;How about two dollars a day? That would be ten dollars a week.&#8221; Huge smiles. (Note to self: Never strike deals with your kids without consulting your other half)</p>\n<p>Well of course she goes immediately to inform everybody of the good news. I happen to go inside for something and I&#8217;m informed by my husband that I&#8217;ve agreed to pay her 60 dollars a month and that&#8217;s just way too much money. I&#8217;m like&#8230;&#8221;well I&#8217;m just talking by the week so it would be 40 dollars a month.&#8221; Still too much. Her pay was knocked to 5 bucks a week and would come in the form of FOOD! Seriously? LOL. I don&#8217;t say anything to him, but I wink at her and give her my &#8216;i&#8217;ll handle him&#8217; face. She&#8217;s immediately relieved. She knows i&#8217;ll be victorious.</p>\n<p>So, after about ten hours of work, I come in and put supper on. Husband and I don&#8217;t stop working until we&#8217;re laying in bed over here. I see husband heading to the back of the house with four gallons of suspicious looking water. &#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; I ask.<br />\n&#8220;It&#8217;s brown water,&#8221; he says.<br />\nWell i can see that. &#8220;What&#8217;s it for?&#8221;<br />\n&#8220;To flush the toilets.&#8221;<br />\n&#8220;Where&#8217;d it come from?&#8221;<br />\n&#8220;The washing machine. If I use this water, we don&#8217;t have to use the city water, another little something I learned about. You might want to tell your friends, most people wouldn&#8217;t think of the money they can save by just doing these simple things.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Definitely can&#8217;t wait to tell my friends. I know they&#8217;re going to be thrilled and begin saving their milk jugs, setting their timers at their washing machines drain cycle and pulling that hose out of the drain pipe and filling their jugs up to haul to the toilets for a whopping savings of 000.5 cents. SMH. It is good EXERCISE however, I give him that much.</p>\n<p>So it&#8217;s the newest idea for savings and I&#8217;m not entirely unimpressed. His &#8220;plan&#8221; is to have all the &#8220;brown water&#8221; sent to a holding tank that would be specifically for flushing toilets. It would go through a standard gravel, sand, carbon filtration. It would be less rain water we&#8217;d need to collect on a whole. I like it.</p>\n<p>What I don&#8217;t like, however, is how DARK he&#8217;s got the house in the evening. We&#8217;ve got no bulb in the kitchen main light, only one pathetic one over the stove and another pathetic one over the sink. And the den exactly connected to it has ONE pitiful bulb in the 5 bulb chandelier. So, I feel like I&#8217;m &#8220;high&#8221; and walking through a dream tunnel.</p>\n<p>That needs to change.</p>\n<p>Dear God, I&#8217;d like to trade out my prayer for &#8220;sweet patience&#8221; with the more useful &#8220;not no, but hell no,&#8221; virtue. Amen.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "post_id": 463, "location": false, "date": "09-07-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["New York State", "Great Danes", "Pittsfield", "The 99 Restaurant", "Autumn", "BJ's"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://www.tarot.com/daily-horoscope/pisces/2013-09-07#.UitBubaqCxQ.wordpress\">Pisces Daily horoscope for September 7, 2013</a>.</p>\n<p>My condolences to the Sipe Family on the loss of their beloved Great Dane, March. \u00a0She was an amazing dog!! \u2665 \u2665</p>\n<p>GLORIOUS autumn day in NYS!!! \u00a0So GLAD to be ALIVE!!</p>\n<p>Hopefully out with my friend Steve later for some shopping and dinner at the 99 in Pittsfield &#8211; don&#8217;t get that way much!! <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)</span></p>\n", "post_id": 475, "location": false, "date": "09-10-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Diseases", "Mosquitoes"], "text": "<p><a title=\"Oooooo - Do NOT Need Any More Diseases - I Have Enough issues!!!!!\" href=\"http://bit.ly/15M1Dkh\">Oooooo &#8211; Do NOT Need Any More Diseases &#8211; I Have Enough issues!!!!!</a></p>\n<ul id=\"webMessengerRecentMessages\">\n<li id=\"wm:mid.1378569860343:7a3978f79db210e598\"><a style=\"font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;\" href=\"http://www.news10.com/category/172705/video-landing-page?clipId=9282632&amp;topVideoCatNo=14990&amp;autoStart=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.news10.com/category/172705/video-landing-page?clipId=9282632&amp;topVideoCatNo=14990&amp;autoStart=true</a>\n<div>\n<div id=\"mid.1378569860343:7a3978f79db210e598\">\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li id=\"wm:mid.1378574709699:5df4196377cc377b19\">Ame Kane-Barkley<br />\nDo I need to worry??<br />\n<span style=\"font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;\">1:25pm</span></p>\n<p>Donna Deville LeBlanc<br />\n*schnort* No more than you would worry about <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"West Nile virus\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Nile_virus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">West Nile</a>, <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"La Crosse encephalitis\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Crosse_encephalitis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">Lacrosse encephalitis</a>, or other mosquito-borne <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Pathogen\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">pathogens</a>.

So I gave Steve one, and I have two left &#8211; one of which I will replace the burned out one in my work room with today. \u00a0By then it was 11:30, which is SOOOO late for me, and I just haven&#8217;t been out doing and socializing like that in SOOOO long it took a lot out of me!!

Now she\u2019s been drawn back to Mexico and the career she walked away from in order to protect the most precious thing in the world: her daughter.</p>\n<p>One desperate phone call brings salvage expert Thad Leighton back to Mexico. For his murdered brother, he\u2019s ready to settle the score, but one look at Maren and everything changes. Years may have passed, but she\u2019s still as mesmerizing as she once was, and a few days on site together have him questioning his priorities and why the hell he walked away from her so long ago.</p>\n<p>Sparks between them reignite, but Thad knows Maren is holding something back. Thrust together in the middle of the sweltering Yucatan, Thad is more than willing to strip away her layers. But while the truth might offer the second\u00a0chance\u00a0he\u2019s been searching for, forgiveness may be as elusive as the relic they\u2019re both hunting. Because when Thad unearths Maren\u2019s biggest secret and discovers who she\u2019s really working for, suddenly it\u2019s not just about a life that was stolen\u00a0from both of them, it\u2019s about staying alive and outwitting a madman who will stop at nothing to get what he wants.</p>\n<p><b>Buy Links: </b><br />\nPre-order Link: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Stolen-Chances-Series-Book-ebook/dp/B00EIV08P4/ref=sr_1_10?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1378598201&amp;sr=8-10&amp;keywords=elisabeth+naughton\">http://www.amazon.com/Stolen-Chances-Series-Book-ebook/dp/B00EIV08P4/ref=sr_1_10?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1378598201&amp;sr=8-10&amp;keywords=elisabeth+naughton</a></p>\n<p><i>Website/Blog:</i>\u00a0 <a href=\"http://www.elisabethnaughton.com/\">http://www.elisabethnaughton.com</a></p>\n<p><i>Twitter:</i> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ElisNaughton\">https://twitter.com/ElisNaughton</a></p>\n<p><i>FB Author Page:</i> <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/elisabeth.naughton1\">https://www.facebook.com/elisabeth.naughton1</a></p>\n<p><i>Eternal Guardians FB Page</i>: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/EternalGuardians\">https://www.facebook.com/EternalGuardians</a></p>\n<p><i>Goodreads:</i> <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2002988.Elisabeth_Naughton\">http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2002988.Elisabeth_Naughton</a></p>\n<p>@ElisNaughton<br />\n#StolenChances</p>\n<p>#StolenSeries</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amebaby.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/viv.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-770\" alt=\"viv\" src=\"https://amebaby.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/viv.jpg?w=300&#038;h=37\" width=\"300\" height=\"37\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.enchantressofbooksblogtours.com/\"><i>\u00a0</i></a><a href=\"http://www.enchantressofbooksblogtours.com/\"><i>Enchantress of Books Blog Tour\u00a0</i></a></p>\n", "post_id": 624, "location": false, "date": "09-18-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://amebaby.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/neverforget.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image\" id=\"i-631\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://amebaby.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/neverforget.jpg?w=380\" /></a></p>\n<p>I remember like it was yesterday where I was when &#8220;it&#8221; happened &#8211; sitting at work at the school my daughter attended and someone racing into our office screaming. \u00a0I pulled up what I could on the internet &#8211; <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Dial-up Internet access\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dial-up_Internet_access\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">dial up</a> back then, servers so clogged nothing would move &#8211; and just stared at the screen. \u00a0I remember someone else coming in and saying they hit the <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"The Pentagon\" href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=38.87099,-77.05596&amp;spn=0.01,0.01&amp;q=38.87099,-77.05596 (The%20Pentagon)&amp;t=h\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"geolocation\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pentagon</a>, too. \u00a0Disbelief &#8211; HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN?? \u00a0I left that job and drove to my other job in Troy &#8211; almost an hour away. \u00a0EVERY radio station was NEWS ONLY &#8211; EVERY.

\u00a0No. \u00a0Not even a remote possibility!! \u00a0So Dr. What&#8217;s His Face (I can&#8217;t remember his name &#8211; it&#8217;s Khalifeh or something like that &#8211; nice guy) comes in, glares at me (screw you too, sweetie) and says we will do the filling and next time, after the deep cleaning on the other side, we will do the extractions &#8211; OKAY? \u00a0 I smile sweetly and say &#8220;Fine &#8211; I will be ALL prepared for that for the next visit &#8211; I will meditate, medicate and do whatever else I need to do to get through that.&#8221; \u00a0 I them bat eyelashes, cause that usually works on men. \u00a0It did. \u00a0He calmed the F down, did my filling, made sure he reminded me 800 times to get a clearance form from my ortho after my ankle surgery so he could work on me, and off I staggered to the car. \u00a0Oh my Gods!! \u00a0I went to the PO &#8211; thank you Beneful for sending me enough samples to feed my dogs for a week &#8211; got all my stuff, came home, ran to the bathroom, shut off the coffee pot, threw my pills \u00a0down my throat and off I wen in search of a fax machine. \u00a0I live in a VERY small town &#8211; so small we don&#8217;t even get out mail delivered; we have to pick it up at the post office. \u00a0So I got to the $ store, get AAA batteries for my menopause hair shaver for my face (freekin menopause), then go to the library to fax the 4 sheets of paper I need to fax to somewhere in Nebraska (I need $ for my tires, so I am raiding my IRA&#8217;s). \u00a0She tries 4 times &#8211; error message on THEIR end &#8211; won&#8217;t go through. \u00a0She says go try Town Hall at the end of your road (I TOLD you this was a small town &#8211; everyone knows everyone). \u00a0I get back in the car &#8211; there is NO WAY I should be driving &#8211; go the back way to the Town Hall, and the really nice pretty young woman who works there says let&#8217;s give it a shot. \u00a0She throws the papers into the fax machine &#8211; nada. \u00a0She says let&#8217;s give it a few minutes &#8211; sometimes this happens. So I sit and watch her multitask like I have never seen anyone do in my entire life &#8211; it was amazing (especially because I was so loopy) and after a few minutes of beeps and boops and buzzes, she announces it didn&#8217;t go thru &#8211; it was a problem on THEIR end, and I should try tomorrow. \u00a0So I go home &#8211; NOW I want a damn drink so bad I could taste it &#8211; I&#8217;m frustrated, pissed, my mouth hurts, I NEED that fax to go through &#8211; I WANT A DRINK!!!!!!!!!! \u00a0I get online, I email my &#8220;sober coach&#8221; (for lack of a better term), I tell her what has happened the whole day between the author shit, the missed cardiologist appointment, the double dentist appointment, the failed fax and the fact that I would love to go buy a bottle of nice crisp cold white wine and guzzle it out of the bottle &#8211; she says NO!!!!!! \u00a0So I do the next best thing. \u00a0I put on my jammies and go lay down on my bed, immediately followed by all the animals. \u00a0I am surrounded by purring cats &#8211; do you know how cathartic that is (notice that word starts with CAT)?

Here is my FB post on it, because I just don&#8217;t feel like typing it all over again!! \u00a0When Life gives you the wrong day for something, you don&#8217;t bitch about it &#8211; you turn it into an adventure!! What a glorious day for a ride across the county almost to the MA border &#8211; foothills of the Berkshires. Stopped at a farm stand and bought myself a sunflower &#8211; one of those stands that still has the &#8220;Trust Boxes&#8221; &#8211; you take your produce, and put your money into the box. Didn&#8217;t think there\u00a0were any left around!! Then decided to stop in at the world&#8217;s Greatest Thrift Store ever &#8211; the Purple Barn on Route 23 in Martindale &#8211; haven&#8217;t been there in years &#8211; hasn&#8217;t changed in years!! Spent tons of time talking to the owner (you kind of have to &#8211; she&#8217;s one of those kinds of people who just loves to talk to everyone), and left with a GORGEOUS velour black pullover shirt with a blingy zipper for $5 &#8211; a 2 piece skirt and shirt set for $6, some belts, a tank top that will go with everything that I so desperately needed and $1 bottle of silver nail polish!! I did good!!!! Got to the PO at 10 of 5 &#8211; ran in, grabbed everything, gossiped a wee bit (well &#8211; you have to &#8211; it&#8217;s the Post Office!!!!!) and came home with HUGE SMILE on my face. It&#8217;s not what I set out to do, but it turned into a beautiful, fun filled day, and sometimes those are the best ones of all!! LOVING LIFE!!!!! \u00a0Yes, I got the day wrong for the art exhibit &#8211; it wasn&#8217;t Friday, it was today. \u00a0And by the looks of the time and the weather, I don&#8217;t know if I will make it. \u00a0It will be packed with &#8220;cidiots&#8221; (NYC people who NEVER drive, rent a car to drive up here for events and don&#8217;t think traffic laws are applicable to them). \u00a0They do 20 in a 55 (&#8220;OMG A COW!!!!&#8221; \u00a0OMG ANOTHER COW!!&#8221; \u00a0OMG pumpkins GROWING on green stem things on the ground!!!&#8221;), etc., and do 55 thru towns that are posted at 30 &#8211; never mind someone might be crossing the street or waiting to turn or something &#8211; that doesn&#8217;t apply to THEM!!!!! \u00a0I shall see how I feel in a little while, check the weather, and see if I want to deal with all that bullshit. \u00a0I think I have had my share for the week!!!! \u00a0On the bright side, my horrorscope DID tell me to go shopping/buy something for myself, and the gorgeous black and bling Bob Mackie sweater I have had my eye on for a few weeks got dropped to $19.95 on eBay, so I snatched that sucker up faster than a shopper at a Macy&#8217;s One Day Sale!! \u00a0*does the dance of joy* \u00a0So hopefully I will get my title, my new tires and my head shrunk next week, along with the meds I messed up for Monday (please Dr. Semlear, be in a good mood!!!). \u00a0Love and Light and enjoy your weekend &#8211; my daughter texted me at 10:30 and said they were on their way &#8211; they live 12 minutes away &#8211; it&#8217;s now 2:20. \u00a0*head desk* \u00a0And they wonder why I need my head examined!!!!!! \u00a0O.o</p>\n", "post_id": 845, "location": false, "date": "09-21-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Think before you speak", "Love"], "text": "<p>&#8220;The only good thing you&#8217;ve ever done right in your sorry life!!&#8221; \u00a0I still miss you, Dad. \u00a0Even though that hurt me more than you can ever know.\u00a0<a href=\"http://amebaby.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/deedsandboonealf.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image\" id=\"i-93\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://amebaby.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/deedsandboonealf.jpg?w=310\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 88, "location": false, "date": "08-30-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Mastectomy", "Breast Cancer Survivor"], "text": "<p>Because it really DOESN&#8217;T matter. \u00a0You have a heart of GOLD and I love you!! \u00a0<a href=\"http://amebaby.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/fashion-magazine-mastectomy-small-19659.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image\" id=\"i-99\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://amebaby.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/fashion-magazine-mastectomy-small-19659.jpg?w=590\" /></a>\u00a0love yourself!! \u2665 \u2665</p>\n", "post_id": 95, "location": false, "date": "08-30-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>You think you&#8217;re ready for it. \u00a0They are out of the house, living on their own, living their own lives, paying their own bills, still asking for money &#8211; most of their belongings still in their old rooms, even though they promised they&#8217;d get them out 2 years ago. \u00a0You&#8217;ve moved on with your own life &#8211; if you are me, you&#8217;ve lost 140 lbs, gotten sober, had a breakdown, gone off Prozac and on Effexor and then off Effexor and on nothing now. \u00a0You&#8217;ve met new friends and tried different things and bought new clothes and tried to accept compliments gracefully when people say &#8220;Holy SHIT you look amazing&#8221; or when your old boss doesn&#8217;t recognize you at the Post Office. \u00a0You&#8217;ve tried out therapy and decided you like it. \u00a0You&#8217;ve come to terms with your 2nd surgery of the fucking year and you&#8217;re making arrangements and all kinds of groovy things.

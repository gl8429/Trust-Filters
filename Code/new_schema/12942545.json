My husband and I had lived at our last place for nearly six years and in those years I held parties and cooked and did what I love &#8211; baking. So to say I knew my oven is a misnomer. I was intimate with my oven.</p>\n<p>It burned me, it steamed in my eye, it emitted foul odors when I didn&#8217;t clean it right and it fed people from across the boroughs. It also ran hot.</p>\n<p>Which to those who don&#8217;t cook I&#8217;m not making a joke. Ovens can run hotter or colder and still say 350 degrees. My mother&#8217;s oven for example runs a little cooler. Take for instance a batch of brownies to be cooked at 325 for 25 minutes. My mom&#8217;s would take about 28 &#8211; 29 minutes, with my old oven, I&#8217;d clock it around 22-23.</p>\n<p>With the move, I lost my beloved oven.</p>\n<p>Now I&#8217;m stuck with the\u00a0 a temperamental oven.</p>\n<p>Yesterday&#8217;s recipe for the pound cake came out dry. Wanna know why? My oven runs hot. Sometimes.</p>\n<p>I followed the recipe, stopping it about 3 minutes before the recipe called for it and the cake was still dry.</p>\n<p>Granted, I should have checked a little more frequently if I knew my oven was pms-ing but hey, I didn&#8217;t ask for your logic. So just take it and move along.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_121\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://annetaintor.com/caption/tag/domestic-bliss\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-121 \" title=\"magnets-do-i-ever-question-your-lifestyle\" src=\"https://allmirthnomatter.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/magnets-do-i-ever-question-your-lifestyle.jpg?w=250&#038;h=250\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Move along&#8230;.</p></div>\n<p>So, I have to break in my oven.

My hair has always been a variation of the above color for the past 29+ years. I have tried auburn and I have tried red and all it did was give me highlights. As a teenager I didn&#8217;t experiment with colors in my hair because 1 &#8211; my mother would&#8217;ve cut all of my hair off 2 &#8211; I had the fear of damaging my hair put into my head by hairstylists, mothers and black ladies (I&#8217;m half-black, this argument is valid).</p>\n<p>So, I didn&#8217;t realize the bleach would stink like hellfire and brimstone! I also didn&#8217;t realize I should&#8217;ve kept the bathroom door open and only realized my folly after the first three glovefuls of bleach were in my hair, making my eyes burn and my nostrils run pell-mell away from my face.</p>\n<p>After getting the first layer on, I believe I used like a third of the bottle or some such, I clipped it up with a plastic clip and started to see results immediately. Now, this is where it gets exciting &#8211; or so I think.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_125\" style=\"width: 235px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://allmirthnomatter.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_0363.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-125\" title=\"IMG_0363\" src=\"https://allmirthnomatter.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_0363.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">OUCHIES!</p></div>\n<p>I think I&#8217;m allergic to hair dye. I often get the burning and itchy sensation and it always feels like my scalp wants to peel away from my skull. Which is a gross image but imagine if you felt it?</p>\n<p>I kept a washcloth handy so that I could wipe away the blood, sweat and tears and yet the burning continued. Even after I ringed my scalp line with chapstick (I don&#8217;t keep Vaseline in the house).</p>\n<p>I started playing Borderlands 2 while I waited the requisite 50-60 minutes for the bleach to strip away my hair color &#8211; and my follicles.</p>\n<p>At around 45 minutes, I&#8217;m noticing that only parts of my hair are pale blonde while the rest is orangey blonde. It actually looks pretty cool but I&#8217;m still pissed because my hair is going to be uneven. I realize I might have to go out and buy a second box.</p>\n<p>15 minutes later I drown my hair in shampoo to stop the bleach from going any further because you&#8217;re not supposed to let the bleach stay in your hair for longer than an hour. BUT you can re-bleach immediately.

I didn\u2019t have another job lined up because I quit due to the fact that I was going bananas.I started looking for a few jobs before I quit but I wasn&#8217;t getting any call backs then. So I figured, better I leave before my head explodes and the nice cleaning ladies have to clean up brain matter off of my cubicle walls.</p>\n<p><strong>June \u2013 July 2010</strong> \u2013 My rest period. I needed a break and my husband agreed with me about this grace period.</p>\n<p><strong>July \u2013 August 2010</strong> \u2013 I was supposed to be writing.

It\u2019s an ancient holiday that was once called Samhain by the Celts (think before 10<sup>th</sup> century). It means November and roughly broken down and translated means \u201cSummer\u2019s End\u201d. It was the New Year for the Irish, Scots and Manx Celts. It was a time to take stock of your harvest and prepare for the new year and oncoming cold. You would slaughter your livestock during this time in order to prepare and keep others that could handle the oncoming time. It was pretty much about preparing for surviving and honoring what took place in the last year. Including the dead.</p>\n<p>According to Peter Berresford Ellis in his book \u201cThe Celts\u201d the celebration of Samhain was:</p>\n<p><i>\u201c</i>[The}\u2026<i>one day of the year when the Otherworld could become visible to this world: on the feast of Samhain, the eve of 31 October to 1 November. This was a time when the supernatural boundary between the two worlds was broken down and people, the living and the dead, could move freely between the two lands. IT was a time when those who had been wronged by the living could return and haunt them. Christianity, unable to suppress the belief, adopted it. 1 November became All Hallows Day or All Souls Day and the evening before, \u2018Hallowe\u2019en\u2019.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>The custom of wearing costumes and masks as to trick the evil spirits by pretending to be one of them (sort of like in zombie movies when someone tries to act like a zombie so they don\u2019t get eaten by the real zombies) or to ward them off.</p>\n<p><i>\u201cThe Gaelic custom of wearing <a title=\"Costumes\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costumes\">costumes</a> and <a title=\"Mask\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mask\">masks</a> was an attempt to copy the evil spirits or ward them off.

Large turnips (also known as <a title=\"Rutabaga\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutabaga\">rutabaga</a> or swedes) were hollowed out, carved with faces, placed in windows to ward off evil spirits\u201d</i> &#8211; Wikipedia</p>\n<p>In the 11<sup>th</sup> century, the church adopted the Holiday and made it a bit more religious and soon after began the propaganda that the holiday was a time for demons, devils and evil to leak out and shouldn\u2019t be celebrated.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong>Pun\u2019kins</strong></span></p>\n<p>Pumpkins were actually an American thing that started in the late 1800\u2019s and early 1900\u2019s.

They do have turnips and rutabagas and other stuff that I would never eat and would prefer to carve up into a slightly creepy mannequin face. The Celts didn\u2019t even carve these things until later into Christian Conversion of the holiday around the earlier part of the 20<sup>th</sup> century.

Ever.</p>\n<p>I\u2019d like to introduce you to my friend Mariet, an artist and a Halloween connoisseur, who will be helping me with this little editorial.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy!</p>\n<p>Once upon a time little girls dressed up as zombies, flappers, mummies, ghosts, cops, wrestlers, Disney characters and action heroes/figurines.</p>\n<p>Then something happened in their life. Maybe their father left them. Maybe they discovered the pleasures of sex too early. Maybe they were ignored by their parents. Maybe they liked extra candy.</p>\n<p>No one knows what happened but the story goes that these little girls grew up in a culture <strong>that celebrates being half-naked and flaunts an impossible ideal</strong>. These children took those costumes that they were as a child and sexified them.</p>\n<p>Yes. They sex-i-fied them.</p>\n<p>To this day, on the days leading up to Halloween, these girls \u2013nay, these Women, for that\u2019s what they are now, have lowered the neckline of their princess costumes, hiked up the hems of their action heroes and cut out large portions of their cop uniforms until you don\u2019t know what they are until they tell you that they are the Sexy version of something.</p>\n<p>Let us not be hypocrites. Sometimes sexy is cool. I may have been a sexy cat or whatevs for one Halloween. Hell, I may have been a cute ass pirate.</p>\n<p>BUT! While I understand that Sexy is the new Halloween costume (much to my chagrin because I would really like to see a Neils Bohr costume) and the clothing is just the accessory, there are just certain costumes that are just bad ideas; either through horrible social connotations or just for the sheer creepiness factor.</p>\n<p>My friend Mariet and I were watching one of my favorite video blogs and up popped an ad for <a href=\"http://www.yandy.com.\">www.yandy.com.</a> A lingerie company that makes sexy Halloween costumes. Just like Frederick\u2019s of Hollywood &#8211; <a href=\"http://www.fredericks.com.\">www.fredericks.com</a> except the difference is that these costumes are just like..wow.</p>\n<p>It got us to start a-thinking, which can either end badly or amazingly (in this case, A-MAA-Zingly) of the horrible sexy costumes that are out there.</p>\n<p>Listen, if everyone is wearing a sexy costume you\u2019re gonna wear one too. You\u2019re not going to be like Lindsay Lohan in Mean Girls and show up wearing a mummy bride costume. You\u2019re just not so stop pretending.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_162\" style=\"width: 480px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://allmirthnomatter.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/lindsay-lohan-3-lacey-chabert-2-amanda-seyfried-2.jpeg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-162\" title=\"lindsay-lohan-3-lacey-chabert-2-amanda-seyfried-2\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://allmirthnomatter.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/lindsay-lohan-3-lacey-chabert-2-amanda-seyfried-2.jpeg?w=470&#038;h=313\" height=\"313\" width=\"470\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">I think the lesson in all of this is actually :Never do anything LiLo would do.</p></div>\n<p>So with that in mind, Halloween is not the time to sex-i-fy just anything. \u00a0Childhood memories, anything childlike, things that are supposed to be scary or animals should not be sexy.</p>\n<p>So for your sake and mine, me and my good friend Mariet have put together a list of certain costumes that you just shouldn\u2019t sexify.</p>\n<p>Because it\u2019s creepy.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s start with Queen of Halloween, Mariet.</p>\n<p>These are Mariet\u2019s top five \u201cAre you fucking kidding me\u201d sexified costumes:</p>\n<p>Well ladies, it&#8217;s that time of the year again, where we all have to practice our walk of shame in our brightly decorated costumes.

That has about the same sex appeal as dressing up as a sexy hamburger.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_175\" style=\"width: 176px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://allmirthnomatter.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/sexy-hamburger-costume-3307-3.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-175 \" title=\"Sexy-Hamburger-Costume-3307-3\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://allmirthnomatter.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/sexy-hamburger-costume-3307-3.jpg?w=166&#038;h=300\" height=\"300\" width=\"166\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Look Lady, I don&#8217;t know why you&#8217;re dressed like that either</p></div>\n<p>- <strong>Sexy Unicorns</strong> &#8211; You can be a sexy cat.

It\u2019s the only place that you can get stuck in a Wikipedia or IMDB wormhole, which is great for trivia night at your local pub but not so great for your work productivity. It\u2019s also the easiest place to meet strangers. Weird as that sounds, it\u2019s true. More people are willing to talk to some stranger on the internet than their neighbor or that one guy you always see on the way to work. Why? You feel that there is an element of anonymity.</p>\n<p>This is kind of hilarious because it\u2019s not 1997 and it\u2019s pretty easy to figure out who you\u2019re talking to. Or who you\u2019re about to hire.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://ledgerlink.monster.com/benefits/articles/33-dude-seriously-facebook-could-cost-you-a-job\">CareerBuilder,</a> in 2009 45% of jobs were checking out their potential hires on social media sites like Facebook and Twitter.</p>\n<p>35% of employers didn\u2019t hire candidates based on their online profile. So, you know maybe taking that picture of snorting heroine off a hooker\u2019s ass wasn\u2019t the best profile pic.\u00a0 Perhaps your iNterneT Speek showed others why the education system was failing. If it wasn\u2019t any of the above, it could be that when you said that you were a rocket scientist but all of your pictures, interests, and friends comments prove otherwise, then you\u2019re a liar. Companies don\u2019t like that.</p>\n<p>Any intelligent person can understand that potential employers want to check out what they\u2019re getting into.</p>\n<p>But is it legal?</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t have the answers to that, there are too many conflicting ideas and thoughts on the web and all my employment law litigator contacts are buried somewhere in a desk that I no longer sit at. I imagine that if it were, you would need to sign off on something like you do when potential jobs check your background.</p>\n<p>My take? As long as it\u2019s not illegal, inflammatory or harmful, who cares? Granted, everyone should take into consideration that the internet has a wide and broad audience and if you don\u2019t want something to be blown up out of proportion, you shouldn\u2019t post it but if you did, you shouldn\u2019t be punished by a potential job.</p>\n<p>If you can get into work on time, work solidly and be an integral part of your team what you do in your off hours are your business.\u00a0 If your dumbass friend took that picture of you passed out while your other friend drew a large penis on your forehead, it shows that you might have considerable lack of judgment when it comes to friends but it doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t boot up a computer and write a killer proposal.</p>\n<p>There should still be a thing as something as off limits when it comes to jobs. They have you for about 8 hours a day for about 48 weeks of the year. If you want to blow off steam in a manner fitting your personality then it\u2019s none of their business.</p>\n<p>I have personally seen candidates not get hired based on their Facebook profiles. I tried to persuade him to call the person in but he merely shook his head and claimed that a person who is posting those kinds of party pictures would not be reliable.</p>\n<p>I didn\u2019t agree and my respect for that person went down considerably.</p>\n<p>The other night I was at my local watering hole when I brought this subject up and randomly a guy next to me jumped into the conversation and said \u2018yeah, I\u2019ve not hired candidates based on their Facebook pages\u2019.\u00a0 I found that interesting and we started talking. I understood where he was coming from and we talked about ways to protect your identity and make certain things private but my argument was I shouldn\u2019t even have to do that because what I do on my own time is my business.</p>\n<p>The danger of checking someone\u2019s social media pages can be vast. I\u2019ve always wondered if \u2018stupid party pictures\u2019 was just a code for not agreeing with their age, race, political affiliation or their looks. It\u2019s a kind of discrimination I think.\u00a0 One that you can\u2019t even sue for because you haven\u2019t even been hired.</p>\n<p>I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is it\u2019s not fair to be vetted by some unseen human resources assistant based on something that is supposed to be fun and not on your merit.</p>\n<p>I hope this doesn\u2019t cost me a job.</p>\n", "post_id": 19, "location": false, "date": "08-23-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["baby", "after these messages"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://allmirthnomatter.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/please-stand-by.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-199\" alt=\"please-stand-by\" src=\"https://allmirthnomatter.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/please-stand-by.jpg?w=470&#038;h=264\" width=\"470\" height=\"264\" /></a></p>\n<p>Hi all!</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not dead I promise.

You&#8217;re out of touch with everyone else, managing your daily needs can be a chore and if you&#8217;re illness is severe enough, the very idea of getting up and going to the bathroom can be a feat in and of itself.</p>\n<p>I am still part of a support group over on Babycenter.com for people with HG (hyperemesis gravidarium) and many of the women over there don&#8217;t have any real life support. Their friends and family don&#8217;t know how to deal with them, don&#8217;t know anything about this disease or don&#8217;t want to, and generally ignore or are passive aggressive towards the ill person.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve experienced some of this and it hurts. A lot. When the people who love you or, who you thought cared about you, don&#8217;t seem to want to have anything to do with you when you&#8217;re going through a bad time, well it can be damaging.</p>\n<p>When I first got sick, I had hope that it would end at four months. Once that didn&#8217;t happen and the sickness worsened, I began to get depressed. Between hormones and the feeling that no one understood or cared or that I was somehow being punished, every day was a trial.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t usually ask for help. But I told my friends and family that I was sick and what I had wasn&#8217;t just normal morning sickness. It wasn&#8217;t going to go away, adjusting my diet wasn&#8217;t going to help, and simply putting on a happy face wasn&#8217;t going to make me well.</p>\n<p>I was lucky, I immediately gathered a support group. Not through anything I asked or wished for but simply because I was immensely lucky to have certain people in my life who cared about me and my health enough to support me through this. My husband is one of them.</p>\n<p>It was trying to get certain family members to understand what was going on. I came up against a wall. They either didn&#8217;t want to know or didn&#8217;t care or in some cases thought I was making a mountain out of a mole hill.</p>\n<p>That hurt the most.</p>\n<p>Some of the women I&#8217;ve had the pleasure and privilege of interacting with have had it much much worse. Their HG, more severe than mine, confined them to their beds and made them slaves to the vomiting and nausea that consumes us all.</p>\n<p>No one knows much about HG. It is a disease. It&#8217;s a chronic illness with varying level of severeness but with one thing in common. There is no cure. There is a chance of a respite and there is always a chance of a relapse in the worsening of symptoms. I have a mild case. If I get pregnant again, there is a very high percentage stating that I will jump from mild to medium or severe.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s hormonal and it&#8217;s chemical and that&#8217;s only the current theory.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll tell you what it is though. It&#8217;s a scary and unbiased beast that will attack and keep you pinned down even while you&#8217;re screaming &#8220;Uncle&#8221;.</p>\n<p>It can shutter you in a dark place that exists only in your own mind and create such a siphoning void of exhaustion and despair that depression is the only option.</p>\n<p>From weeks 28-39 the HG slammed into me. Vomiting, extreme fatigue, headaches, horrible nausea, dehydration and just general irritability. At around week 31, I started shunning my support group because I began collapsing into myself. I didn&#8217;t want to talk to anyone. I just wanted to give birth. I just wanted relief. I would&#8217;ve done anything. In fact I did. I did accupressure, I walked, I walked some more and did more accupressure. Anything to feel like I was doing something.</p>\n<p>I leaned more on my internet group because I didn&#8217;t have to talk and they knew, more than anyone, what I was going through. Reading their stories, telling mine, got me choked up a few times.</p>\n<p>I was also lucky and had people that educated themselves on what was going on with me. For that I can&#8217;t help but be very grateful. However, the truth of the matter is; the only people that will ever know, with 100% clarity, what you&#8217;re going through are the ones that have gone through it or are going through it.</p>\n<p>This is true for many chronic illnesses. I will never understand what a cancer patient or AIDS goes through because I have never had those illnesses. I can relate to some of their feelings but I can never fully understand.</p>\n<p>But you know what, sometimes all a sick person needs is understanding.</p>\n<p>From my own experience I can safely say that the people who will stick by you are the ones that will help you up rather than watch you lie there.</p>\n<p>But here&#8217;s the thing folks, being a caring and thoughtful person costs nothing and if you&#8217;re not the caregiver or in the support circle, then <strong>NOT</strong> being a dick should be easy peasy.</p>\n<p>Based on experiences seen, heard and experienced, I&#8217;ve compiled a few tips on how to not be when your friend or family member is sick.</p>\n<p>1. <em>The sick person is sick.</em></p>\n<p>They aren&#8217;t making it up and they aren&#8217;t exaggerating. Never tell a chronically sick person that they really aren&#8217;t sick. This is rule number one. You my friend, are not a doctor and apparently you are not close enough to the patient to know what&#8217;s going on. This is strike one and a pretty major one. You&#8217;ve basically declared that your friend/family member is a liar or a drama queen and you don&#8217;t really trust them.</p>\n<p>Welllllll&#8230;here&#8217;s the thing. A doctor or hospital has diagnosed them. The pills next to their bed are real and the schedule that they are on to ensure they don&#8217;t get even more sick is important and real.</p>\n<p>HG might not be understood but it is real. Your loved one is not lying.</p>\n<p>2. <em> Research is the best defense</em></p>\n<p>There are a handful of sites that deal with HG and only about two that are official and offer an in-depth description on HG. <a href=\"http://www.helpher.org/hyperemesis-gravidarum/\">Helpher.org</a> is one of them. They too have a FAQ on how care for a loved one who is ill.</p>\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t just apply to HG here. There are tons of diseases that are confusing to a person who doesn&#8217;t have it and like helpher.org, there are also tons of organizations that will explain and offer tips on how to help.</p>\n<p>If you are armed with the knowledge of what the disease is, what treatments are being done and what options there are, then you are making great strides in not be a jerk. It shows that you care enough to know what&#8217;s going on. You get bonus points if you didn&#8217;t have to be prompted by your sick friend to check out the illness.</p>\n<p>3. <em>You don&#8217;t have to be the caregiver, you just have to care</em></p>\n<p>A phone call, a text, an email, a smoke signal, maybe even carrier pigeons, anything that makes the sick person feel like you took a minute to say, &#8220;Hey, are you ok? I&#8217;ve been thinking about you.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If you honestly care about the person, it costs you nothing (except for standard fees where applicable) and gives your relationship an extra boost. It also gives you +5 charisma.</p>\n<p>4. <em>Talking about the sick person behind their back makes you look awful</em></p>\n<p>And it will come back to haunt you. The sick person is sick. If you are not the caregiver or the nurse, you shouldn&#8217;t be bad mouthing the sick person. Unless you really are a dick. In that case, why are you reading this? Shouldn&#8217;t you be on reddit?</p>\n<p>5. <em>Do not offer advice unless you absolutely know what you&#8217;re talking about</em></p>\n<p>The sick person has heard it a million times. Try resting more, drink more water, eat some dry crackers, bathe in the blood of a newly born calf that was born under the eighth moon of the eleventh month yada yada yada.</p>\n<p>Your job is just to listen. Ask questions or keep the sick person cleverly diverted. Unless specifically requested please shut the hell up with your pseudo-science advice. You look like an idiot and the sick person, if they could, would most likely punch you in the mouth.</p>\n<p>There are plenty other nuggets of advice, ranging from not commenting on the sick person&#8217;s appearance to not asking if they are STILL SICK (because they are fully aware of 1. what they look like and 2. the length of their illness).</p>\n<p>All you need to do, as a loved one, is to love the sick person. Don&#8217;t isolate the sick person any further, keep them updated via email or text. Invite them to places the first month just to make them feel like they haven&#8217;t dropped off the face of the planet. Respect their decisions. Don&#8217;t argue with said decisions. Make yourself available. Don&#8217;t promise something you can&#8217;t commit too and above all; be understanding.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not easy on anyone when there is an illness involved. It directly affects the sick person and the caregivers. As a friend, you should ask if there is anything you can do. Not what they can do.</p>\n<p>Just. Don&#8217;t be a dick.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>*thanks to the ladies on the HG board. You got me through many a months.

The <a href=\"http://www.helpher.org/hyperemesis-gravidarum/\">HG</a> is back and I&#8217;m on the phone with my mother-in-law. We&#8217;re talking about HG support groups. I&#8217;m on one over at babycenter and she joined one on Facebook (because she&#8217;s awesome), so I&#8217;m clicking around on babycenter and lalalala&#8230;.a video starts.

I want ALL the drugs. </p>\n<p>I&#8217;m also not a fan of needles. Or needles near my spine. So I thought, ok.

It&#8217;s a new chapter and you must adjust accordingly.</p>\n<p>The first thing that gets adjusted is your sleep pattern. Gone are the lazy weekends, the long lie ins, the ability to hit the snooze button for that extra fifteen minutes, and any endings to any dreams you may have wanted to finish (like the one about the cute federal agent who is helping you save the world from zombies and looks great in a tux).</p>\n<p>Now before I get into anything, I will gladly state that I am lucky when it comes to the sleeping &#8220;through the night&#8221; portion of babydom. Now let me explain that sleeping during the night isn&#8217;t an 8 hour affair, it&#8217;s 4-6 with a 20-30 feeding in between and another 20-30 to get baby back to sleep deeply enough to transfer her back to the crib. Then getting up to turn the coffee maker on for your husband and filling up any bottles that you have (because you ran the dishwasher the night before). If you&#8217;re like me, then you also know that just because you put the kid down it doesn&#8217;t mean that you&#8217;re not going to be awake for another 10-15 minutes making sure that baby doesn&#8217;t wake up.</p>\n<p>Yes. I&#8217;m that neurotic.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not going to complain, I get at <em>least </em>4-5 hours of sleep at night plus two or three after her dawn feeding.</p>\n<p>But that doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m not tired.</p>\n<p>As she gets older, she stays awake more. Besides the basics of feeding and changing, she needs to be played with, taken outside, and taught (or at least the beginnings of teaching things).</p>\n<p>So I&#8217;ve taken into account what doctors and other moms have told me: <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><em><strong>Sleep when the baby sleeps.</strong></em></span></p>\n<p>At first I thought I was going to be supermom. The first week taking care of Kid Cusack by myself, there was no napping for me. I was a little too nervous.

Unless you\u2019re rich.

As a kid, back in the day when the economy wasn\u2019t so weird, I always thought that I would have a corner office by the time I was in my early thirties while living in an awesome large Manhattan apartment. I thought that I would be able to hop around if I didn\u2019t like my chosen career. \u00a0Clearly I was watching too much television.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m a writer; I\u2019m probably a couple of years away from being a failed writer. Writing doesn\u2019t pay the bills though.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m nearly 30. I neither have a corner office nor do I live in Manhattan. Which is ok. I discovered that the kind of office environment that I thrive in is not the one I envisioned when I was 12 and desperate to be an adult. In fact those jobs are extremely hard to come by, because no one wants to leave a fun and creative environment.</p>\n<p>I also don\u2019t have a book deal.</p>\n<p>I would say that I feel bad for the graduates that just got out of school but I\u2019m not that altruistic because at the end of the day it\u2019s between me and them. I have about 7 years of office experience doing everything from answering phones to coordinating events.</p>\n<p>That and a dollar can get me a small cup of street coffee.</p>\n<p>The experience, the know-how and the awesome personality? I have all those. What I don\u2019t have is a job because guess what, I\u2019m competing with hundreds if not thousands of people for one job. \u00a0I mean, I\u2019m good, but I\u2019m not that good.</p>\n<p>So, I wake up at a very late time, sit in my pajamas while I wait for my stomach meds to kick in and my coffee to brew and I scour the same internet sites for several hours hoping and praying that today I\u2019ll go up against less people. Or, maybe, just maybe, they\u2019ll be an awesome job out there that I am qualified for.</p>\n<p>If nothing else, at least a job that I\u2019m qualified for.</p>\n<p>I check my email like a crazy person for emails from companies; I check my SPAM (why am I getting things in Russian?) and I check my phone manically. Nothing. Zip. Zero. Nil. Nada. Goose Egg. The operative word here is \u201ccrazy\u201d because the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again expecting different results. \u00a0The results are the same. Nothing. Zip. Zero.</p>\n<p>This concludes Monday\u2019s unemployment rant.</p>\n<p>Pardon me while I check my gmail.</p>\n", "post_id": 38, "location": false, "date": "08-27-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["fear", "writer's block", "writing"], "text": "<div id=\"attachment_46\" style=\"width: 470px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://allmirthnomatter.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/dt-tenth-doctor-anxious.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-46\" title=\"DT Tenth Doctor Anxious\" src=\"https://allmirthnomatter.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/dt-tenth-doctor-anxious.jpg?w=460&#038;h=276\" alt=\"\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">DT as 10th Doctor</p></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The other night I was up late, due to sleeping issues, and an idea came to me. Ok, not an idea so much as a revision of an idea and I couldn\u2019t get it out of my head for the life of me. Every time I dozed off, the images and dialogue popped up in my head like an old drive-in movie and I couldn\u2019t shake it away.\u00a0 Usually this is a great thing. I crave these moments like dragon-chaser craves that ultimate vivid high. To me it means my muse has once again deigned to grace me with her presence (oh muse, you fickle fickle thing).</p>\n<p>It also means that sleep will continue to elude me until I write this stuff down.</p>\n<p>So, being the good little insomniac that I am, I arose from my bed with nary a clatter and stumbled half-sleeping into my living room, grabbing my white board and a marker before plopping down on the couch. Turning on the television, I turn the channel to the Food Network/Cooking Channel (which is another subject for another time) and write by the light of the Iron Chef.</p>\n<p>I erased everything that was on my white board which had Story Idea A on it and started on Story Idea B, which in my opinion was better and more suited to my style and taste. The problem with SI A was that I was never sure if I needed to make it First Person or Third Person. I tend to write in the Third Person focusing on two characters at a time (meaning two POV switches only) and First Person when I am writing a short story or vignette. \u00a0The fact that I was vacillating between the two gave me pause and stopped me from writing more than three pages. I wasn\u2019t sure where the hell it should go and how it should be voiced.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s an indicator that something is wrong.</p>\n<p>Also, the story felt too contrived and it was hard for me to get to the points I wanted to get to. I don\u2019t really have a logical plan when I start writing. I have bios and characteristics and I have a synopsis and points that I want to hit; it\u2019s more like a blue print rather than an itemized list.</p>\n<p>Anyway, back to the story.</p>\n<p>So, erasing everything and writing down the SI B, I feel really good about this story and I can\u2019t wait to write it. I mean I\u2019ve already visualized the important parts and dialogue; all I really need to do is just <em>write it down</em>.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s when it happens.</p>\n<p>Fear.</p>\n<p>At first it feels a little like how you feel before going to a party by yourself and you don\u2019t really know anyone. And they aren\u2019t serving alcohol.</p>\n<p>Then you take a few breaths and mentally mutter \u201cI can do this\u201d but it doesn\u2019t sound as convincing as you thought it was going to sound so you pause and wonder <em>how</em> are you going to do this.</p>\n<p>The nerves turn into anxiety.</p>\n<p>What if I can\u2019t do this? What if it is all going to turn to crap and then I\u2019m going to end up never writing anything and it will end like crap and I\u2019ll keep repeating myself until my fragile ego needs to be coddled and soothed like a mewling infant?</p>\n<p>This is when the awesome numbness slips over you and you can\u2019t do anything but stare at a group of people trying to make wolfberry poptarts FTW!</p>\n<p>I suck.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s the only thought that I had at that moment. That I really and truly just suck.</p>\n<p>I took to Facebook with my feelings of inadequacy and a few people responded that I should pretty much put on my big girl panties and push on.</p>\n<p>On anything else I would completely and wholeheartedly agree.</p>\n<p>But when it comes to something that is such a part of me and is such an expression of vulnerability, I can\u2019t help but listen to the\u201d <em>I can\u2019t do this, this will be awful no matter what\u201d</em>, portion of my brain (that treacherous bastard).</p>\n<p>I think I need a new pair of big-girl panties.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "post_id": 45, "location": false, "date": "08-29-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["food", "repurposed", "candy"], "text": "<p>Nothing much to report here, I&#8217;m gearing up for Writer Friday which I&#8217;m kinda exciting about it.

I loved candy as a kid, an adolescent, a teenager and now. Of course my tastes have varied as I grew up and my tolerance for all things sugary-sweet has dwindled &#8211; and the development of TMJ, has severely limited my candy intake. I still eat candy, just <em>different </em>candy. Which leads me to the point of this particular entry.</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#444444;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;\"><strong>Candy from the good ol&#8217; days (pt 1). </strong>There are a lot of different candies for each age group that you belong too. My grandparents remember penny candies and my mother remembers jawbreakers and what not from the 70&#8217;s. It all depends on when you were born and what generation you were raised in.</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#444444;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;\">Candy, to me, is a notoriously kid thing to eat. Adults frown upon candy and fear that it will spoil appetites (which yes, they can, I&#8217;ve seen the way my sister&#8217;s eat candy) or that it will make them unbelievably hyper (studies show that it isn&#8217;t necessarily the sugar but the anticipation). Adults think of candy as empty calories and things to remember from when they were younger. They sneak it when they think no one&#8217;s looking or pretend to have you twist their arms when you offer it to them. It&#8217;s almost verboten. In place of Candy Buttons, Ring Pops, Caramels or Zagnuts there is Sugar Free Candies and Sugarless gum.\u00a0</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#444444;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;\">Kids, well, any kid that doesn&#8217;t like candy of some kind probably will grow up to be a politician and no one wants that. At the mere mention of candy, kids will study grow quiet and obedient. They will clean their rooms or sweep the patio. They will raise their hands in class or learn math. Kids will steal candy. Kids will give candy. Kids will cry over candy. Kids want candy like an adult wants a strong drink after a long day of work (or visiting relatives). Candy is the great equalizer to kids. It makes everything ok. Until you take it away.</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#444444;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;\">I ate candy, I stole candy, I hoarded candy. I counted candy (anyone remember the &#8220;how many M&amp;M&#8217;s are in the jar?&#8221; exercise). I gave out candy and I bet candy. I have always been a &#8216;candy lady&#8217;. At work, it&#8217;s no different. I can&#8217;t keep it in my house because my husband likes salt. He should&#8217;ve been a politician.</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#444444;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;\">So now, the top 13 favorite candies I had as a child in the late eighties/nineties.

You made my mouth bleed with your sugar blades (or the tiny crevices where the sugar hadn&#8217;t quite cooled properly and opened) and your vivacious fruit taste was mingled with the taste of coppery blood. I&#8217;m not talking about the new sour kind, the Blue Razz or the Black Cherry kinds either. Nor am I talking about the glutton&#8217;s desire &#8211; the Super Blow Pop. I&#8217;m talking old school. The cherry, strawberry, sour apple, watermelon and finally the red-headed step-child of the group, the grape flavor.</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;\">Blow Pops were the Ultimate treat. It was an oral fixator&#8217;s wet dream. Not only was it a lollipop but it had a secret garden of gum! Of GUM I tell ya! I always thought that Blow Pops were the older cooler sibling of the Tootsie Roll pop and about ten times more dangerous. You didn&#8217;t have to be patient with a Blow Pop, there was no counting how many licks it would take to get to the center because nobody cared. In the world of instant gratification, these babies were GOD. You could lick &#8216;em, suck, chomp &#8216;em; it was oral masturbation</span></span>!</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;\">Blow Pops were also a divider. It made the older kids feel superior when the younger ones couldn&#8217;t have them because adults were scared they would choke on the gum. I relished that I was older enough to chew gum and have the added bonus of a hard candy. My little sister didn&#8217;t like it so much. She would have to throw it out before it became gum. It was also the candy of the hip comfortable middle class kids. Blow Pops were not something that was had in my house as a kid. In fact I don&#8217;t think we even had them until Halloween and then it was because the neighbors gave them out. I couldn&#8217;t afford Blow Pops until I was in Middle School and by then I had moved on to other things.</span></span></p>\n<p><a style=\"clear:right;float:right;margin-bottom:1em;margin-left:1em;\" href=\"http://www.toppsonlinestore.com/catalog/PP_ready.jpg\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.toppsonlinestore.com/catalog/PP_ready.jpg\" alt=\"http://www.toppsonlinestore.com/catalog/PP_ready.jpg\" width=\"320\" height=\"320\" border=\"0\" /></a><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;\">\u00a0</span></span></p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;\">2 Push Pop\u00a0</span></span></strong></p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;\">Push Pops were kind of disgusting if you think about it. Sure, the flavors were pretty good. They were the slightly blander, too smooth to be real cousin of the Blow Pop without all of the fun. I enjoyed eating this a lot as a young kid (like 4-5). They were safe for kids because the lollipop never came off* and you could CLIP them onto you! You could never lose them and unlike a real lollipop, if you tired of it you could always cap it and come back to it later (unlike having to put it back in the wrapper or putting it in a cup to put back in the fridge).\u00a0</span></span></p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;\">BUT they were absolutely gross because unlike a lollipop on a stick, where any fluid would get absorbed into the paper, your saliva caught at the end of the Push Pop. Meaning, every time you pushed the damn thing up your fingers were sticky. Try being a small kid and having sticky fingers. It does not work. You get lint on your hands, you get lint in the chamber of the Push Pop and all these equals getting lint on your pop. But I loved it as a kid.

As a New Yorker, I&#8217;m still fucking pissed off. I&#8217;m very proud to be a New Yorker. These people that live in Manhattan are as tough as they come.\u201d \u2013 </em>John Romita Jr.</p>\n<p>Everyone has a story to tell about 9/11. This is mine.</p>\n<p>Eleven years ago I was a freshman in college. I had started classes about two weeks before September 11<sup>th</sup> and I remember it being a Tuesday for because I had an early morning math lecture class that I hated. I suck at math. Some call it a math phobia; I call it just pure unadulterated hatred.</p>\n<p>I had left the class pretty quickly and was walking back to my dorm room and I noticed that everything was sort of quiet. It was a Tuesday and there were classes going on but there were no kids. I filed that away as weird but I\u2019ll be honest, I was tired. Exhausted really because the math class was at 8:30am and I am not a morning person. I also didn\u2019t drink coffee back then so I was bleary eyed and my mind was full of visions of going back to sleep.</p>\n<p>One kid was running back to their dorm but everything was still quiet. Again, didn\u2019t think much of it but a feeling started in the pit of my stomach that I chalked up to my digestive system not knowing what time it was.</p>\n<p>I get back to my dorm, I\u2019m by myself, I can\u2019t find my roommate (which in hindsight was a good thing) and someone tells me to put on the television. That the world trade center had been attacked. I wish I could tell you who told me. I don\u2019t know if it was a phone call or if I heard it from someone out in the hall but all I thought was \u2018yeah right\u2019. I put on the radio and there was no music. Only reports of an attack in New York City.</p>\n<p>I still thought it was some weird War of the Worlds thing. My mind just wasn\u2019t capable of wrapping the thought of someone daring to attack <em>my</em> home around itself.\u00a0 So I put on NBC and I was in just in time to see the second plane hurl itself into the second tower.</p>\n<p>Confusion. Anger. Shock.</p>\n<p>Then sadness.</p>\n<p>I had been there a couple of weeks ago with my Uncle. He worked on Wall Street. We had taken the train from Newark and walked through the terminal where the shops and food stands were; where millions of people passed through every day.</p>\n<p>My Mom had worked in 7 World during the first attack back in the 90\u2019s.</p>\n<p>I knew my Mom was ok. She was working in Queens at that point and my little sisters were in Queens and <em>oh my god, someone just blew up the world trade center</em>.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t think I realized that tears were falling until the first sob. Until my body shook with rage and sadness at the realization that people were dead.</p>\n<p>What looked like papers falling from the towers turned out to be human beings trying to flee a death by inferno.</p>\n<p>Streets that I only knew in passing were covered in ash and god knows what else and <em>oh my god, someone just attacked us.</em></p>\n<p>I think I called my Mom immediately after, my eyes glued to the television soaking up every piece of information and image. My brain still didn\u2019t believe it, there was just no way this could\u2019ve happened. This was just a sick joke and I\u2019d wake up and all those people would be alive and the WTC would still be standing there and when I grew up I could go shopping in the terminal.</p>\n<p>I wanted to go back. Hop on a bus and help with the cleanup and taking care of the survivors.\u00a0 Two hours or so after staring at the TV, I needed a plan of action. I am by nature a fixer. I wanted to help <em>fix</em> this, this horrible wound on my home. I wanted to help patch it up and heal it. I wanted to heal.</p>\n<p>My Mom wouldn\u2019t let me. She wanted me safe. She didn\u2019t want to worry about me getting hurt of if there was a second attack; she wanted me to stay where I was. All I wanted to do was go back home and help those EMTs, Firefighters, Cops and Doctor\u2019s that were risking their lives downtown. I mean, what I knew about medicine could fit a thimble but I wanted to help so bad it hurt.</p>\n<p>My brain, which doesn\u2019t work well in the morning on the best of days, took that info and told my mouth to stop asking. It didn\u2019t stop me from wanting to go but it stopped me from asking.</p>\n<p>But if I couldn\u2019t be there who would be able to stop my family from getting hurt.</p>\n<p>My sisters were little. I wanted to protect them. I wanted my parents to take the kids and get the hell out of the city. Go to PA where my Aunt was and just stay there until this was over.</p>\n<p>We didn\u2019t know if there was going to be another attack and if there was one when it would be. The city and its residents were paralyzed in a state of not knowing. I was and I was nearly 4 hours away.</p>\n<p>I was devastated. \u00a0That\u2019s the best emotion that I can come up with. I didn\u2019t shut the TV off for three days. I barely slept.</p>\n<p>Every morning that I woke up, I had that thought of <em>oh, it\u2019s such a nice day</em> before reality came barreling toward me. No. It\u2019s not a nice day. The city isn\u2019t safe and thousands of people are dead.</p>\n<p>We never stood a chance.</p>\n<p>We didn\u2019t know.</p>\n<p>We weren\u2019t prepared.</p>\n<p>I was depressed for quite a long while.</p>\n<p>I was angry. Very angry. I wanted those that did this dead. I never wanted a war. Just to kill those that had done this. I was hurt but I wasn\u2019t blinded enough to think that a war, where other innocent would die, was good.</p>\n<p>I just wanted the bastards that orchestrated this to pay.</p>\n<p>I was grieving. Much like everyone else, I was grieving the destruction of my home, the senselessness of the violence and the loss of safety.</p>\n<p>I was grieving for those that had lost loved ones.</p>\n<p>I was grieving for those that had given their lives to save others.</p>\n<p>I was grieving for innocence lost.</p>\n<p>Everyone remembers where they were on September 11,2001.</p>\n<p>We should never forget.</p>\n<p>Never forget the determination and sacrifices of the NYPD, NYFD, EMTs and other safety workers who were lost to us.</p>\n<p>Never forget the innocent lives that were snuffed out by a senseless act of violence.</p>\n<p>Never forget the holes that never can be filled for those that have lost someone dear to them.</p>\n<p>Never forget that as New Yorkers we can overcome anything. That we are stronger together than we are apart. That we will Never Forget this tragedy that occurred 11 years ago but we will move on from this.</p>\n<p>Together.</p>\n", "post_id": 70, "location": false, "date": "09-11-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p><span style=\"color:#888888;\">This is a free thought writing prompt that I wrote about a year ago.

Or at least that\u2019s what I thought of my older sister. Blonde, clear blue eyes, flawless skin that would only break out in pimples during her time of the month and curves that made her boyfriend Scott smile like an idiot.</p>\n<p>Despite being pretty and well-liked, Susy was <em>nice</em>. To everyone. Including the weird smelly kid down the block, to my Mom\u2019s bastard of a boyfriend and to the three legged cat that camped out on under our front porch with a predilection to scratch and spit.</p>\n<p>Most importantly she was nice to me.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t have any illusions about what a little shit I had been at thirteen; angry most of the time, obnoxiously sarcastic all of the time and a thief some of the time, I was not a poster child for all that was good and sweet in adolescents. In fact, I had been threatened with boot camp, Catholic school and juvie enough times that a normal kid would\u2019ve known to quit while she was ahead.</p>\n<p>I wasn\u2019t a normal kid. Neither was my situation.</p>\n<p>But, if I knew then what I knew now\u2026well, I would\u2019ve changed. I wouldn\u2019t have pushed buttons, wouldn\u2019t have pushed people away and definitely wouldn\u2019t have opened the door to the man who killed my only ally.</p>\n<p>In hindsight, through therapy mostly, I realized that the weeks leading up to Susy\u2019s murder she had become withdrawn. She was constantly sick and moody, the <em>nice</em> Susy, the cheerleader and valedictorian had been replaced by crazy Susy. The Susy that cried herself to sleep at night, who weeped while brushing my hair and would suddenly become quiet when I entered a room.</p>\n<p>To say that Susy was my sister would be to cheapen our relationship. Yes, she was my biological half-sister; the product of my father\u2019s first marriage.\u00a0 Our Dad had died when I was three and my mother, our father\u2019s second wife, had taken in Susy and for the first few years had raised us like the normal kids we should\u2019ve been.</p>\n<p>It was only when I was nine did shit hit the fan.</p>\n<p>Susy was like my mother. She took me to school, helped with my homework, wiped away my tears, fought for me and fed me. She was the only person in the world I didn\u2019t want to disappoint.</p>\n<p>She was the only person who loved me.</p>\n<p>I let her down when I opened that door.</p>\n<p>Jerry Thomas Willis was six foot three, blonde and dark eyed. He was two hundred and eighty pounds of muscle and had an attitude that was fueled by booze and vitriol. He loved two things, Jim Beam and my mother Janet Berk. The two J.B\u2019s in his life, he would joke as he smacked my mother\u2019s ass.</p>\n<p>Janet hadn\u2019t always been Jerry\u2019s whore. No, she had been a paralegal who had graduated near the top of her class and held two degrees. When my Dad had been alive she had affectionate, if slightly distracted. With her long black hair and grey eyes, my mother had captivated my father with a look. Or at least that\u2019s how she told it. I think it might have been the fact she was pregnant with me.</p>\n<p>As Jerry\u2019s girlfriend, Janet went from an intelligent and beautiful woman to a weak willed shell.</p>\n<p>The smacks on the ass had turned into smacks across the face which then migrated to beatings.</p>\n<p>They evolved into a familial <em>thing.</em></p>\n<p>I was twelve when Jerry broke my arm.</p>\n<p>He gave me a few more bruises and scrapes before my mother finally kicked him out and taught both Susy and I about gun safety.</p>\n<p>You can never forget the smell of gun powder and freedom.</p>\n<p>Susy had always remained unscathed. Scott, though only five nine, had squared off with Jerry a few times and Jerry, though a drunk, was not stupid enough to go after Susy.</p>\n<p>Except for that Friday night in October.</p>\n<p>Jerry, stumbling drunk and pissed off beyond measure had come to our back door. Janet had been at an AA meeting, Susy was babysitting and Scott was at school.</p>\n<p>Pissed that I needed a babysitter, pissed that I was stuck in a backward town in a decrepit ranch house with only one tv and no cable, pissed that I was thirteen and <em>alive</em>; I opened the back door and in came Jerry.</p>\n<p>For years I beat myself up over that; <em>He hadn\u2019t needed to even knock on the door, I just let him in</em>. It took many years of therapy to realize that no, I hadn\u2019t let him in, he had pushed me aside so hard that I had bounced off of the wall and onto my face. I still had the bump in my nose to prove its brokenness.</p>\n<p>Whatever happened after that will always remain a blur. I remember hearing shouting and a loud crash. Then the sound of flesh against bone and a thud, and then the screaming. That sound still wakes me up at night. It\u2019s the sound of pure terror.</p>\n<p>To this day, I can\u2019t tell if it was her or me that was making such an awful sound.</p>\n<p>There had been pleading and begging and shouts for me to run, to get away.</p>\n<p>I remember that the song playing on the radio was \u201cTainted Love\u201d.</p>\n<p>My memories play like a dream when I think about how the order of events happened. The radio blaring, the sound of the radiator kicking in and Susy crying and pleading that he leave her baby alone.</p>\n<p>My thirteen year old self thought she had meant me.</p>\n<p>I just know that before the absolute quiet hit, I had reached into the freezer where my mother kept my Dad\u2019s .38 special.</p>\n<p>If I think about it, I must have slipped the safety, stood behind him and pulled the trigger but if you put the same gun to my head, I wouldn\u2019t be able to swear to that. All I know is that the screaming had stopped and the radiator stopped kicking and I had squeezed the trigger, the recoil knocking me backwards, smacking my head against a protruding brick from the fireplace we hadn\u2019t used in five years.</p>\n<p>Darkness, sweet blissful darkness came after that.</p>\n<p>When I came to in a hospital, a smiling nurse at my side and a sobbing Scott on the other side, I pretended to be asleep. Something about the tension in the room made me wary about waking too soon. It was only when I heard the third voice near the foot of my bed, Detective George Marster from the Greene Sheriff\u2019s department, that my sister, my beloved sweet sister who I had called a bitch when she hadn\u2019t changed the radio, was dead.</p>\n<p>I was also told that Jerry Thomas Willis had survived the gunshot wound to his chest.</p>\n<p>It was days later, when I was being settled into Scott\u2019s well used Chevy that he told me that Susy had been pregnant. They had planned on getting married and taking me with them to Boston.\u00a0 He loved me like a little sister, he had said with his voice tripping on unshed sobs, and he was still moving to Boston and I was more than welcome to come with him.</p>\n<p>Susy would\u2019ve been proud of me, he had said as tears finally fell from his eyes. He had aged at least ten years in the past few days and I knew that I didn\u2019t look like a young kid anymore.</p>\n<p>My Mom didn\u2019t fight me when I packed up my stuff.</p>\n<p>Scott\u2019s the only family I have and we\u2019re both still haunted.\u00a0 We rattle around the house and make all of the appropriate noises that living people do. Every once in awhile we even have fun.</p>\n<p>But then one or both of us gets quiet.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m not sure what he\u2019s thinking but I know what is bouncing through my head. I know what I can never tell him.</p>\n<p>I know where Jerry Thomas Willis is. I know his schedule, his patterns, his disgusting habits and the fact that I have to close this particular end.</p>\n<p>Not have to. <em>Need to.</em> Taking a life for a life, that\u2019s the only thing that will satisfy this living breathing blackness that has taken residence in my chest.</p>\n<p>I need to do it for both of us.</p>\n<p>Which leads me to now.</p>\n<p>I am 30 years-old and I will perpetrate my first murder.</p>\n", "post_id": 74, "location": false, "date": "09-13-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://allmirthnomatter.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/598485_354816054586100_1853206012_n.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-78\" title=\"598485_354816054586100_1853206012_n\" src=\"https://allmirthnomatter.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/598485_354816054586100_1853206012_n.jpg?w=470&#038;h=500\" alt=\"\" width=\"470\" height=\"500\" /></a></p>\n<p>I don\u2019t believe that humans, as a species, are lazy.

Well, yeah. I believe individuals can be anything they want to be but that they don\u2019t necessarily reflect on the species as a whole.\u00a0 However, that\u2019s a rant for another day.</p>\n<p>This unemployment Monday I got to thinking about the value of work. I\u2019ve been feeling pretty damn low lately. I\u2019ve been wracking my brains to try to pinpoint the actual reason why (you would think it would be obvious to me but there are other things going on in my life that I can never be so sure). I\u2019ve been lethargic and pinwheeling between moments of brilliant creative thinking and hopelessness. In short, I guess I\u2019m a little blue. The reason why, the big bright neon reason why, is simply that I am not working; I am not receiving validation as a person in society.</p>\n<p>Work is a necessity. Office work, while suffocating and soul sucking at times, is just as important as farming used to be two hundred years ago. We are all cogs in a machine but we are all rewarded cogs. I\u2019m not just talking about the monetary tag attached to work but the actual feeling of satisfaction after completing a job well done and contributing to the overall bottom line.</p>\n<p>I do not get the same sense of accomplishment when I do my laundry, it\u2019s close, but it\u2019s not the same.</p>\n<p>Humans like to feel like they have done something; that they have made their mark in the world somehow.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s an adrenaline rush but it\u2019s not the same as finishing a project that took you two weeks and stressed you out so badly that you started to lose sleep and snap at those close to you.</p>\n<p>There are others out there that will argue with me and say that keeping house and maintaining it instills the same feeling.</p>\n<p>You wouldn\u2019t be arguing. I agree. There\u2019s a sense of accomplishment but to me, read \u201cto me\u201d, it\u2019s not the same. \u00a0It\u2019s arbitrary, I suppose, but society dictates that every member of the society that is over a certain age should be working to further the society.</p>\n<p>Sitting at home searching for positions while I\u2019m waiting for the coffee to drip doesn\u2019t do much to fill the hole for me. Frankly, I\u2019m not really furthering anything other than my electric and shopping bills.</p>\n<p>When an unemployed person goes out and meets people that she/he doesn\u2019t really know, it begins to wear on them that they have to keep answering the question of \u201cwhat do you do\u201d with a self-conscious smile, a bitter chuckle and a \u201cI\u2019m unemployed\u201d.</p>\n<p>It begins to make me feel like I\u2019m less of a person.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t particularly have a career but I\u2019m good at jobs.\u00a0 I hate waking up and I might curse having to work within confines but it makes me feel like a productive member of society.</p>\n<p>Then I feel sad as if I haven\u2019t contributed anything to anyone.</p>\n<p>That feeling you get at work is an intangible feeling. Some will it accomplishment or ambition; I, frankly, don\u2019t know what to call it but I do know that I\u2019m missing it.</p>\n<p>Hell, there\u2019s only so many times you can sit on your couch eating Havarti and Pepperoni and watching a very bad Hallmark Channel film.</p>\n", "post_id": 77, "location": false, "date": "09-18-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://allmirthnomatter.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/borderlands-2.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-83\" title=\"borderlands-2\" src=\"https://allmirthnomatter.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/borderlands-2.png?w=470&#038;h=286\" alt=\"\" width=\"470\" height=\"286\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>&#8220;<strong>Setting</strong></em></p>\n<p><em>Five years have passed since the events of <a title=\"Borderlands (video game)\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderlands_%28video_game%29\">Borderlands</a>, when four vault hunters located Eridian Vault and confronted an eldritch abomination known as &#8220;The Destroyer&#8221;.

Since then Handsome Jack rules over the inhabitants of Pandora with an iron fist from his massive supply base built in the shape of an &#8220;H&#8221; on Pandora&#8217;s moon.

I mean, I didn&#8217;t know there would be a sequel but I hoped. Then when I heard the announcement about a year ago I started doing my happy dance and proceeded to countdown the days (not really but it sounds dramatic enough).</p>\n<p>The original game was actually one of the first games my husband and myself played together and really enjoyed. I played as Lilith and he, Mordecai (I believe). We spent a lot of our weekends and evenings playing this game. When we beat it, we both did happy dances.</p>\n<p>Purchasing Borderlands on it&#8217;s release date here in NYC, I had plans to play it with him but of course, real life intervened. We finally cracked it open yesterday and let me tell you, it&#8217;s gorgeous. A gorgeous game with awesome voice acting. The only issue is getting used to the map/lvl up/armory/mission screen.\u00a0 It&#8217;s a bit of a pain in the ass and with the split level screens seemingly smaller, it&#8217;s hard to view as one whole chunk. There&#8217;s a lot of scrolling. We didn&#8217;t get very far because it was late and my husband had to go to work this morning so we played for about two hours and beat the first two missions.</p>\n<p>So far: The human bad guys seem to be the same so far but the missions are a little harder. Also, there&#8217;s a Cold Weather version of the Skaags &#8211; the bullymongs. Don&#8217;t let them get close my friends. Also, the adult ones, they throw freaking rocks. Bastards.</p>\n<p>Anyhoo, I&#8217;ll keep you updated on the progress and any very interesting things I come across but if I&#8217;m missing for awhile, you&#8217;ll find me on my way to Sanctuary.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "post_id": 82, "location": false, "date": "09-20-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["writing prompt", "disgust"], "text": "<p>This week&#8217;s writer&#8217;s prompt is brought to you by the emotion: Disgust.

Trying to reconcile what he\u2019d lost with what he\u2019d allowed to happen. Slowly, he had started to piece together some sort of life for himself.</p>\n<p>He signaled to Gus, the old bartender with a scar from Vietnam and an attitude from Brooklyn. Without a word, Gus poured another few fingers of whisky into a glass that was about as clean as Gus\u2019 language and plopped it down.</p>\n<p>It might have been a long time since he\u2019d ever had the need to be on high alert but what was ingrained in him wasn\u2019t going away, not even in three years. It allowed him to always stay one step ahead of everyone.</p>\n<p>Everyone but himself.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s why he didn\u2019t need to see Gus\u2019 eyebrow quirk and his thin lips turn down to know exactly who was behind him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll have what he\u2019s having,\u201d a voice like velvet said behind him.</p>\n<p>\u201cBen?\u201d</p>\n<p>Though Gus\u2019 tone said very little, he could read the old man like a book. Gus didn\u2019t like strangers but he wouldn\u2019t turn a paying customer away. It had taken Ben a good two years before Gus spoke more than two sentences to him.</p>\n<p>What Gus was asking was if the woman behind him was welcome.</p>\n<p>Ben shook his head slightly and with a nod Gus walked down to the other side of the bar.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t very nice.\u201d</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t want to turn around. Didn\u2019t want to pay any attention but if he didn\u2019t, she wouldn\u2019t leave. She still smelled the same, a strange mix of lilacs and jasmine.</p>\n<p>It made him want to puke.</p>\n<p>Turning, his eyes roamed over her tall lithe body. \u201cYou look the same,\u201d he said blandly.</p>\n<p>\u201cStill alive.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPity.\u201d</p>\n<p>As she moved to the side of him, she smiled her patented ruby red smile. It was meant to entice him. All it did was make his head hurt and his intestines burn.</p>\n<p>With fingers as graceful as a pianist, she stroked back a lock of his brown hair, frowning as he moved away.</p>\n<p>He felt as if a thousand tiny spiders had crawled over the spot where she had touched him.</p>\n<p>Though his heart was beating a million miles a minute and his muscles were tensing with the need to shove her away, he maintained his composure, calling upon years of service training to control his movements.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d he said calmly.</p>\n<p>He knew whatever it was, he wouldn\u2019t be doing it. She was prettier than a picture but as dangerous as anthrax. Besides, she was a stone cold killer. Even he had his standards.</p>\n<p>\u201cI need your help.\u201d She said softly as she moved closer. Her perfume clogged his nostrils and he slammed back his drink so he didn\u2019t gag.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need anyone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI need you.\u201d</p>\n<p>He curled his lip and stood. If she had been anyone else, with her silky black hair and come-hither body, he would\u2019ve heard her out.</p>\n<p>As it stood, he wouldn\u2019t give her the time of day.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou need to leave.\u201d</p>\n<p>She shook her head, a curtain of her hair falling over her face. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ben looked at her closer, certain her act of helplessness was exactly that. An act.</p>\n<p>To an innocent bystander, she looked a little lost, a little scared, a bit vulnerable. To him, he caught the glimmer of excitement in her cold brown eyes. She was anything but vulnerable.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s when the memory hit him, hard and with no warning.</p>\n<p><em>His men running around the compound, pulling out the innocent and rounding up the bad guys, while she laughed like a maniac. Knives in her hands that moved like ribbons. Blood spattering her cruel but beautiful face, her legs and torso kicking and twisting as she killed those that had bombed a small school. To her, they were nothing. To him, they were bastards but he didn\u2019t need to be the one who killed them.</em></p>\n<p><em>He called her by the name she had given him, but she didn\u2019t answer. When the bastards were down, she moved on. Speaking in a language he didn\u2019t understand. He understood the movement of the knives, the sound of gunfire, and his men falling to the ground.</em></p>\n<p><em>She had betrayed them and then she had slaughtered them all. His men and the innocent. Whoever got in her way, she had cut them down.</em></p>\n<p><em>He couldn\u2019t move as she came closer to him. Her eyes lit with an unholy glee and her ruby lips turned up in a smile that seemed better suited on a pumpkin.</em></p>\n<p><em>She spoke again in that language he didn\u2019t understand as she placed a bloody hand to his cheek.</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cRemember.&#8221; was all that he head before the knife entered his lungs.</em></p>\n<p>As the memory receded and the sound of music and laughter again reached his ears, he smiled at her. A smile that made her eyelid twitch.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving. You don\u2019t get to follow me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBen.\u201d she said his name with a reverence that rang false.</p>\n<p>It made his skin itch and he ached for a shower.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got three minutes before I call the sheriff and tell them an internationally wanted psychopath is standing in Gus\u2019 Saloon.\u201d</p>\n<p>Her smile returned and she saw the relief flash briefly on her face. \u201cDo you really think some Podunk sheriff can take me down?\u201d</p>\n<p>Blood rushed to his ears as his stomach began to violently beat against his abdomen. Ben shrugged and signaled to Gus he wanted another one.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t. I do know that if you hurt one hair on anyone\u2019s head and then it\u2019s me you\u2019ve got to face. I reckon I don\u2019t have too much to lose.\u201d</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t wait for her answer or her reaction as he hurried past her to the men\u2019s room, saliva filling his mouth with the unpleasant burn of bile burning his throat.</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t hear the voices asking if he was ok as he emptied his stomach into a toilet that had seen better days. No, all he heard was the sound of crying. And the high pitched laughter of a woman who had gone over the edge.</p>\n", "post_id": 86, "location": false, "date": "09-23-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["rant"], "text": "<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rs2HHYtGhP0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Waking up at three in the afternoon after not being able to sleep until three thirty in the morning is a problem.</p>\n<p>Lethargy, despair, and a cup of coffee greet most of the unemployed in the morning &#8211; \u00a0myself included.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve noticed that the job boards are playing the same songs.\u00a0 There hasn\u2019t been any real change in the posting\u00a0 and the so-called additions of jobs are usually in fields that are<em> so</em> specific (with all employers begging for experience) that even if I wanted to apply I wouldn\u2019t get the job.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t have the experience and I\u2019m likely to never get it at the rate we\u2019re going.

Not the greasy processed Entenmann&#8217;s variety (which I did have on my table and got stale because I would pass by it and cringe) but the good ol&#8217; fashioned buttery cakey wonderful kind.</p>\n<p>So I began to look on the interwebz. I checked my usual suspects; The Pioneer Woman &amp; Smitten Kitchen and couldn&#8217;t really find anything so I scoured the web and came up empty. So I tried one more time over at Smitten and wham bam! I found it. The recipe that would satisfy my craving and offer me the opportunity to use vanilla. Until I saw the vanilla beans. Fear froze me as my tastebuds began to tingle. Smitten Kitchen&#8217;s recipe called for vanilla beans. *gulp*</p>\n<p>I bake .I do. In the fall. But never with something as precious as vanilla beans. Extract? Sure. I try to only buy the best because frankly, I love vanilla but beans? No way. No how.</p>\n<p>But the pictures.

With a baking spatula. OK, a fancy old-fashioned way.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Then you add your eggs. Have you ever wondered what 9 eggs look like?</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_105\" style=\"width: 235px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://allmirthnomatter.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0340.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-105 \" title=\"IMG_0340\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://allmirthnomatter.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0340.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nine Damn Eggs</p></div>\n<p>Eggs are expensive and seeing nine of them go into the cake&#8230;it sorta breaks my heart. Then I focus and remember&#8230;vanilla bean pound cake!</p>\n<p>I whisked my eggs into the pound cake because pound cake is only as heavy as the air it gets. If you add more air, the cake is lighter. I think you get the picture right?</p>\n<p>Speaking of, I didn&#8217;t include a picture of the egg/sugar/butter mixture because I had my hands full and it looked curdled. I had a moment of absolute panic because there was no way I was going to redo this recipe. NINE EGGS OK, NINE DAMN EGGS!</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s OK though. I realized it was all just air and my panic subsided. It&#8217;s what happens when you add air.</p>\n<p>Next is the dry ingredients. I decided to sift the flour/salt mix in because I could. Plus, I like my flour and salt to be well mixed. Plus, I like to declump my flour if I can. You don&#8217;t have to. You can just dump the dry ingredients in the bowl. As long as you dump them in gradually it doesn&#8217;t really matter.</p>\n<p>If you decide to sift, load up your sifter and while mixing gradually add your flour. I did it by adding half a sifter at a time.</p>\n<p>This is the final result:</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_107\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://allmirthnomatter.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0346.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-107\" title=\"IMG_0346\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://allmirthnomatter.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0346.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Is it Cake yet?</p></div>\n<p>Now here comes the fun part. The Spanking!\u00a0 At this point I&#8217;ve already greased my pan (have you ever noticed that the spray butter always sort of smells like popcorn feet? It&#8217;s gross but I had no other choice since I used ALL of my butter) and floured it. Which is something I hate, I hate flouring cake but hey, the recipe told me to.</p>\n<p>So after you spank the pan with the batter in it,<del>\u00a0 like it&#8217;s a bad bad cowboy</del>, to distribute the batter evenly and then you pop that baby in the oven. <a href=\"http://allmirthnomatter.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0348.jpg\"><img class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-109\" title=\"IMG_0348\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://allmirthnomatter.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0348.jpg?w=150&#038;h=112\" width=\"150\" height=\"112\" /></a></p>\n<p>You did remember to pre-heat the oven to 325 degrees right? Because if not, clearly this is your last chance.<br />\nNow the waiting begins. Approximately 75 minutes of it. Go do something else. Have a drink, read a book, watch a short film or do what I did and clean up after yourself!

Try to stop yourself from checking the oven often. Heat escapes from that little hotbox and then you&#8217;ve got to wait just a bit longer for your cake to cook. You keep doing it and that little bit longer takes <strong>a lot longer</strong>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">After checking to see that it is done, with the inevitable conclusion that it is, take that baby out of the oven and let it sit in the pan for about ten minutes. Yeah, that&#8217;s right, let it cook just a bit more in its own cakiness.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_110\" style=\"width: 235px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://allmirthnomatter.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0349.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-110\" title=\"IMG_0349\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://allmirthnomatter.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0349.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Marry Me?</p></div>\n<p>After the ten minutes, transfer the cake to a cooling rack. If you don&#8217;t have one then you can always use the rack that comes with your microwave. You know, the rack that no one understands the purpose of? Well, you&#8217;ve just re-purposed it. Yay! Give yourself -5 carbon footprints or something.</p>\n<p>Anyhoo, you might have to jostle the cake pan or &#8220;spank&#8221; the pan a bit in order to get the cake out. If you&#8217;ve greased and floured well, then this should take two or three whacks (man, this sounds like a bad food porn). If not, my advice is to use a knife to cut around the sides of the cake and then try again. Also, pray. Because chances are you&#8217;ve ruined the bottom of your cake. But hey, who cares. Only show people the top and then give them alcohol and no one will be the wiser.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_111\" style=\"width: 235px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"http://allmirthnomatter.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0352.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-111 \" title=\"IMG_0352\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://allmirthnomatter.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0352.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">upside down vanilla bean pound cake</p></div>\n<p>Close up of the bottom &#8220;Ah yeah&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_112\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://allmirthnomatter.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0353.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-112 \" title=\"IMG_0353\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://allmirthnomatter.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0353.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">yum</p></div>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Turn it right side up so that you&#8217;re able to let the cake settle the way that it should.

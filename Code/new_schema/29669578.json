It won&#8217;t necessarily be easy, as a child who has become habituated to sleeping late can be very resistant to an earlier sleep pattern but it is about habit-changing and persistence and perseverance can help both of you to establish a new routine.</p>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<h2>Steps</h2>\n<div id=\"steps\">\n<ol>\n<li>\n<div>1</div>\n<p><b>Stick to a consistent routine</b>. It is tempting to let children stay up later on the weekend but this is where children learn how enjoyable it is to stay up later and it gives them the desire to do so on other nights. When a routine exists that requires your child to be in bed early every night of the week, this provides a sense of consistency that children can easily adapt to. This means keeping a consistent bedtime and waking time.</p>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>2</div>\n<p><b>Ensure that your child has a comfortable sleep environment</b>. The room should be at a good sleep temperature of around 16\u00baC (60\u00baF). If it is not possible to keep the room warm enough, add blankets and a child-safe hot water bottle to warm the bed. Avoid using electric blankets as these are not considered to be safe options for children.<sup id=\"_ref-0\"><a title=\"\" href=\"http://www.wikihow.com/Help-Your-Child-Change-a-Poor-Sleep-Pattern#_note-0\">[1]</a></sup>\u00a0If the room is too warm, strip the bed down to a sheet only, leave a glass of water at the bedside table and open the window if possible. It is also important that the room is quiet. This means no noise from TV, talking or other hubbub.</p>\n<div></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>3</div>\n<p><b>Keep distractions out of your child&#8217;s bedroom</b>. Remove anything that might distract a child such as computers, TV, video games etc. The family room is the place for these highly distracting devices. For teens, this will be more difficult, but you can institute a check at a certain hour to make sure they are not sneaking in extra time. The problem lies in the fact that using computers, playing video games or watching TV winds up our mind and it takes considerable time to unwind after using these devices. A good rule of thumb is to require reading, card playing, writing or drawing on paper etc. type activities to replace electronic activities one hour before bedtime. This becomes &#8220;down-time&#8221;. To make it fair, this should apply to everyone in the family, regardless of age, to help all get a good night&#8217;s sleep!</p>\n<div></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>4</div>\n<p><b>Don&#8217;t let your child consume products that might keep them lively past bedtime</b>. Ban consumption of soft drinks, coffee, tea, chocolate etc. that contain caffeine several hours before bedtime. Make it a rule that come 6pm, all drinks must be caffeine free. This will be harder on teen children than on younger ones.</p>\n<div></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>5</div>\n<p><b>Avoid using bed as a source of punishment for time-outs</b>. Children will associate being sent to bed with bad experiences and this can hamper their desire to go to bed and sleep.</p>\n<div></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>6</div>\n<p><b>Get out and exercise</b>. A bike ride or a ball bounce after dinner can do wonders for improving sleep patterns. However, care must be taken not to encourage exercise too close to bedtime or hearts will be racing and sleep will be long in coming.</p>\n<div></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>7</div>\n<p><b>Change the whole family&#8217;s sleep patterns</b>. If getting up early is an issue for everyone, perhaps it is time the whole family went to bed early. It can be a fun but instructive game for mom and dad to go to bed earlier than their child once in a while. Tell your child you are going to bed and that they had better hurry up and beat you. Turn out all the lights in the rest of the house except for where teeth are being cleaned and the bedrooms. The message soon becomes clear and everyone gets a good night&#8217;s sleep! This can be a great way to kickstart a new sleeping routine for the entire household and the kids feel involved as a part of the general shift, rather than being the sole focus.</p>\n<div></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>8</div>\n<p><b>Be persistent</b>. Your child will likely argue and whine. Be ready for that and have ears of steel. Repeat the mantra that &#8220;your bedtime is now, the TV time is over&#8221; or &#8220;Goodnight, sleep tight&#8221;.

He was withdrawn and didn\u2019t want to talk. After some coaxing, my wife finally got to the bottom of things. My son had worn his new red basketball shoes to school and an older boy had come up with his buddies and said, \u201cI\u2019m the only one in this school who has red shoes. If you wear those tomorrow, we\u2019re going to beat you up!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Fortunately, in this case, school administrators jumped in and took swift disciplinary action. The kid who was bullying was immediately confronted and advised that if it ever happened again he would be out of school. He was told not to talk to my son again about this, and he never did.</p>\n\n<p>Studies\u2026</p>\n</div><p class=\"reblog-source\"><a

According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, favoritism can be defined as \u00a0\u201cthe favoring of one person or group over others with equal claims.\u201d Favoritism is exactly how it sounds like; its favoring a person not because of the quality of their work but the status of their social apparatus. This can be demonstrated through honoring and \u00a0giving awards. \u00a0It is natural and reasonable to have favorites. We all have no doubt favorite food, hobbies, and colors. These express the individuality and freedom of a person. These are the aspects that make the world a better place. But when does it become a problem?

Can&#8217;t think of what to do? This is precious free time, and it would be a bad idea to waste it. If you&#8217;ve finally got some break time and have no idea how to spend it, then don&#8217;t panic. Just read this article&#8230;</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>1Sleep. Have you always wanted to sleep in, but had to get up because of work/school? Well now is your perfect chance. Turn off your alarm and sleep your way through the early hours of the morning. You can also stay up late, then sleep late.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong> 2Take A Trip Somewhere. It can be anywhere, Florida, a friend&#8217;s house, your grandmother&#8217;s farm, anywhere. Take time to kick back and see some new places, or just chill out with somebody you know. Get a change of scenery and forget your troubles.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong> 3Learn Something New. There&#8217;s a ton of knowledge just floating around out there, waiting to be gained. Try learning a new skill, like knitting or a fresh sport. Or pick up National Geographic, turn on the TV and have a look at something educational and interesting! Research up on your favourite topics and take some time to study.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong> 4Read. Catch up on your reading. Head out to the local library or book shop and pick up some new novels. Find a genre that suits you and take time to see what authors you like best, or get more knowledgeable about some. Reading can be educational or just fun, and there&#8217;s something out there for everybody.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong> 5Shop. Plenty of stores have sales when there are breaks from work or school. Have a look around at your favourite shops, and see what you can get. This may be the perfect time to treat yourself, or get a present for a friend or family person. Take a friend with you and enjoy a long, hardcore shopping spree.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong> 6Call up a friend. Catch up with one of your friends. This is a great time to brush up on a friendship. Plan an outing with a bunch of friends or just that special close buddy, and have fun together. You could even go shopping or take your trip with them!</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong> 7Practice a skill. If you&#8217;ve been trying to improve on something or been lazy, use this spare time to brush up on it. Practise singing, an instrument, sports, whatever you&#8217;ve been doing. Use this time to perfect another skill.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong> 8Have a girl&#8217;s/guy&#8217;s day out. If you&#8217;re a mother, take your daughter out. If you&#8217;re a father, spend some &#8220;bonding&#8221; time with your son. Call a bunch of your girlfriends over a for a fun night in, or catch up with the guys for some sport or partying. Have fun with some same sex mates.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong> 9Spend time with your child/children. Spend some quality time with the kids. Go out and do something that you all enjoy, whether it be a movie, sport, or a cosy night at home watching movies. Get to know your children even more and have some fun.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong> 10Cook. Cooking is a fun and useful skill that anybody can learn. Pick up a cookbook or somebody skilled and get cooking! Be creative and think up your own recipes, or dream up something imaginative for dinner.

In the event of a fire:</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Propane BBQ: Turn off the burners, and shut off the tank valve if you can reach it safely.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Electric BBQ: Unplug or turn off electricity.\u00a0</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Charcoal BBQ: Close lid over the grill</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Grease Fires: Use a fire extinguisher to damper flames.

Besides impairing the grillmaster&#8217;s motor skills and synapses, plus alcohol is extremely flammable!</strong></span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>For the Gas Barbeque&#8230;</strong></span></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Propane Tanks:\u00a0Inspect the cylinder of the tank for visible dents, leaks, or rust. If you see any damage, you should replace it.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Gas Pressure: Be aware of the temperature wherever the propane tank is stored, transported, and used. Keeping the propane container in a warm area increases the pressure of the gas and could cause an explosion.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Recycle: Do not throw away your propane tank in the trash; municipal and private programs are available for recycling. For disposable propane tanks, use all of the gas before tossing.</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>For the Charcoal Barbeque&#8230;</strong></span></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Lighter Fluid: Only use lighter fluid on unlit charcoal briquettes, not on coals that have already been lit. Never pour fluid directly onto an open flame, the fluid path could ignite the entire container!\u00a0</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Charcoal: Heated coal pieces get extremely hot, never try to handle coals or ashes. After BBQing, place the ashes in a metal container with a lid, and mix them with water. This mixture should sit for several days before being disposed of in accordance with state regulations.</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>For the Electric Barbeque&#8230;</strong></span></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Electric Requirements: All extension cords and wall sockets must be able to handle the amperage of the electric grill. Otherwise the circuit board can become overwhelmed and start an electric fire.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Combustible Materials: Anything flammable should be kept at least 10 feet away from the grill when it&#8217;s in use.</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span style=\"color:#dc2300;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Arial Black', sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:x-large;\">Keep safe</span></span></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n", "post_id": 1146, "location": false, "date": "05-26-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>GREAT</p>\n", "post_id": 1148, "location": false, "date": "05-26-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>LOVE CHOCOLATE</p>\n", "post_id": 1150, "location": false, "date": "05-26-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<div class=\"wpcom-reblog-snapshot\"><div class=\"reblogger-note\"><p class=\"reblogger-headline\"><img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/100aa1c08f8ec8a2d3740400f8d5af5a?s=32&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-32' height='32' width='32' /><a href=\"http://allaboutmanners.wordpress.com/author/allaboutmanners/\">allaboutmanners</a>:</p><div class='reblogger-note-content'><blockquote><p>ONE FOR THE WEEKEND</p>\n</blockquote></div></div><div class=\"reblog-post\"><p class=\"reblog-from\"><img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/f6768d4f7b2d1c6253952ae4a181b9fc?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />Originally posted on <a href=\"http://tableinspiration.wordpress.com/2013/05/26/banana-ice-cream-2/\">Table Inspiration</a>:</p><div class=\"reblogged-content\">\n<p><a href=\"http://tableinspiration.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/ice-cream.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-65\" src=\"http://tableinspiration.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/ice-cream.jpg?w=205&#038;h=300\"   alt=\"ice cream\"><p></p></a><strong>Ingredients:</strong><br>\nRipe bananas</p>\n\n<p><strong>Method:</strong><br>\n1.

Regardless of opinions on the cull, I think everyone can admit that badgers make great subjects for drawings. Lots of black and white for contrast and big fluffy fur texture!</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">If you want to show your interest in the cause, there are petitions on 38 Degrees and the official e-petitions\u2026</p>\n</div><p class=\"reblog-source\"><a href=\"http://tansyhutchesonlovett.wordpress.com/2013/05/27/badgers-in-the-sketchbook/\">View original</a> <span class=\"more-words\">2 more words</span></p></div></div>", "post_id": 1164, "location": false, "date": "05-27-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<div class=\"wpcom-reblog-snapshot\"> <div class=\"reblog-post\"><p class=\"reblog-from\"><img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/981beaa5dcb9c4c174067ae92b273ab2?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />Originally posted on <a href=\"http://subplans.wordpress.com/2013/05/27/childrens-book-week/\">Sub Plans</a>:</p><div class=\"reblogged-content\">\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://www.bookweekonline.com/\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://www.bookweekonline.com/system/images/4/original/CBW-Poster-400.gif?1361462837\" height=\"363\" width=\"280\"></a></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>It was Children\u2019s Book Week a few weeks ago and I stumbled upon Half Price Book\u2019s list of 40 Books Every Child and Adult should read.

Before she knows it, her best friend Joseph is abducted by a mysterious object that pours from the earth. She bravely decides to follow on the hopes she can save him but she finds herself on a planet very different from home.

The way I was raised was to have basic manners. You hold the door open for people, respect your elders, help people out without being asked, say thank you and please, the whole shabang.It was just a natural reaction, when you see someone drop something, you pick it up and give it back. If an elderly lady is going through a door the same time as you, you hold the door open and let her go first. General manners that seem like they should occur without being said. Common knowledge right?Well, apparently not. First, when I was leaving Walmart with my family, I saw a man walking perfectly fine walk up quickly, cut an elderly man (with a cane mind you) off and take the last motorized wheel chair. I couldn&#8217;t believe it. My jaw dropped. The elderly man was clearly more in need of the chair than the other man yet it was rudely taken from him. It was even done in such a manner that because the elderly man moved too slow the other man had gotten to it first, and he clearly saw the elderly man was walking to it. It just leaves me pondering, what is wrong with people.</strong><strong>Later that day as my family and I entered the grocery store I saw a woman drop a $10 bill from her pocket. Another woman reached down and tapped the original woman on the shoulder and handed the money back. I watched in amazement because I couldn&#8217;t believe I just saw a kind act for the first time in such a long time. I couldn&#8217;t remember the last time I had seen someone do something nice like that. Most people would have pocketed it.</strong><strong>This leaves me wondering when did it become unusual to see acts of kindness? Shouldn&#8217;t it be in our nature to do these simple acts of kindness? We should not be in awe when we see someone help a complete stranger out. How are we to move forward in life, in humanity, if we can not do these simple acts.</strong><strong>This leaves me to say, next time you see someone struggling to lift something, hang up the cell phone for a minute and help them out. If you are walking into the bank and some woman is juggling 3 kids, hold the door open. We need to get back to the point in society where rudeness is not tolerated. It all starts with one simple act. Teach your kids these general manners so they are not long lost in the future.</strong></span></div>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>If a few people start to make these simple changes, it will have a chain reaction through out our families, communities, and society. By you taking the time to carry out a simple act you can brighten someones day, put a smile on someones face, and even change someones perspective on life. So please take the time to practice a few simple manners.</strong></span></p>\n", "post_id": 1208, "location": false, "date": "06-01-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags":

You might want to have a practice on quiet roads or off the road before heading out.

They are getting better balance, but can still fall off very easily!\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Helmets</strong>\u00a0are a must for everyone, including toddlers in child cycle seats. A helmet can prevent serious head injuries if your child falls off a bike. It&#8217;s also a good idea for them to see adults setting a good example, so if you wear a helmet you can help them see how &#8216;cool&#8217; helmets are!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Off-road.\u00a0</strong>It can be fun to explore your local area and find some safe places for your child to practice cycling. Local parks, paths, and gardens can all give your child a safe place to ride until they\u2019re old enough to cycle on the road.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Exploring by bike (children aged about 7-10)</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Children of this age will probably try to push the boundaries a bit &#8211; they want to ride further and faster! They&#8217;re still a bit too young for road cycling, but with the right equipment and safety tips they can have great fun on their bikes while staying safe.\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Helmets! They&#8217;ll probably be tired of hearing this by now, but they need to put their helmet on every time they go out. Some children might still need help doing up the straps and making sure the helmet is secure. It&#8217;s not worth the headache if they have an accident without one!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Children have better coordination and control at this age, so they&#8217;ll be getting more confident on their bike. They&#8217;re still not ready to cycle in traffic, though, even if they&#8217;re with Mum and Dad.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Cycling confidence (Children aged 11 and up)</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Many children at this age will want to cycle to and from school, or go out on their bike with friends. It&#8217;s OK for them to ride on the road \u2013 but they should be properly trained to cope with\u00a0</strong><strong>traffic \u2013 and there&#8217;s lots you can do to help prepare them for the risks.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Most schools now offer cycle training for children. If you can encourage them to do the training, they&#8217;ll build their confidence and be able to deal with the road risks more easily.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">A working bike is a safe bike! Doing tire checks, brake checks, and looking for damage are all part of owning a bike. If you do these checks with your child you can teach them how to recognise problems and (if you know how!) help fix them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">It might not always be stylish, but high-visibility clothing saves lives \u2013 fluorescent for daytime and reflective for after dark. Even during the daytime, bright jackets are easier to spot than dull ones. Make sure drivers can always see your child by making them stand out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">It&#8217;s easy to forget that cyclists can be dangerous too. Help your child learn about the risks of the road by talking to them about their responsibility. Not riding on pavements and checking for pedestrians and other cyclists is a crucial part of their learning to ride.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Cycle training at school</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>If you\u2019d like to get your child cycling, cycle training can give them the confidence and skills they need to ride safely.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><a href=\"http://www.bikeability.org.uk/\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Bikeability</span></a>\u00a0is one of Cycling England\u2019s flagship schemes.

But there are other things you can do to keep your child safe in the car.</strong></span><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Teach children not to play in or around cars</strong></span><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>It&#8217;s very easy for a child to want to play hide and seek in a car. But your child can lock themselves in the car and overheat within minutes on a hot day. Never encourage your child to unlock the doors of your car to &#8216;help&#8217; you and always keep your keys out of your child&#8217;s reach.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Consider not using sun shades</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Sun shades are great for keeping the sun out of children&#8217;s faces on hot days. But in the event of an accident they can quickly become projectiles. The suction cup used to keep them on the windows may not hold the shade in place in a high speed accident. In addition, the faster you travel, the heavier something becomes. That sunshade that weighs about a pound, becomes a sixty pound projectile during a 60 mile per hour accident.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Consider not using a mirror for rear-facing infants</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Everyone knows about those mirrors you can put attach so you can see your rear facing infant. But some studies have found that those mirrors actually cause more accidents. First, it&#8217;s actually hard to see your child through those mirrors. You will have to take your eyes off the road for more than a few seconds to see your child, opening you up to causing an accident. Second, those mirrors can also become a projectile if you&#8217;re involved in a high speed accident.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Never leave your child alone in car</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Most states have laws against leaving your child alone in the car. Children can overheat very quickly in a warm car. Older children can loosen their seat belt, and climb into the driver&#8217;s seat. From there, it&#8217;s easy for a child to figure out how to undo the parking brake and cause an accident.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>No Toys</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Don&#8217;t give your child toys that they can throw at you. Your child may throw a temper tantrum and then throw that toy at you, potentially causing you loose control of the car and cause an accident.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Teach children to use their seat belt</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>If you&#8217;re tired or distracted, you may forget to put on your child&#8217;s seat belt, or make sure your child&#8217;s seat belt is correctly placed. Teach your child to double-check to make sure you&#8217;ve done up the seat belt each time they get into the car. Have them pull on it to make sure it&#8217;s been correctly latched.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Pull over to attend to your child</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Never reach for loose toys, open a juice box or scold your child for undoing their seat belt while driving. Pull over to a safe spot to attend to your child&#8217;s needs.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Since car accidents are major cause of injuries to children, it&#8217;s very important to take a few extra steps to keep your children safe in the car.</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n", "post_id": 1291, "location": false, "date": "06-08-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<div class=\"wpcom-reblog-snapshot\"> <div class=\"reblog-post\"><p class=\"reblog-from\"><img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/bdfbda66da20e02d3f84dcb257facd28?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />Originally posted on <a href=\"http://sjikkevelo.wordpress.com/2013/06/08/with-kids/\">Sjikke Velos in Leive</a>:</p><div class=\"reblogged-content\">\n<p>Coming to town with kids on a sunny saturday: no one needs cars or busses.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://sjikkevelo.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/img_5604.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-422\" src=\"http://sjikkevelo.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/img_5604.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=682\"   alt=\"IMG_5604\"></a><br><a href=\"http://sjikkevelo.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/img_5608.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-423\" src=\"http://sjikkevelo.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/img_5608.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=682\"   alt=\"IMG_5608\"></a><br><a href=\"http://sjikkevelo.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/img_5610.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-424\" src=\"http://sjikkevelo.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/img_5610.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=682\"   alt=\"IMG_5610\"></a><br><a href=\"http://sjikkevelo.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/img_5611.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-425\" src=\"http://sjikkevelo.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/img_5611.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=682\"   alt=\"IMG_5611\"></a></p>\n</div><p class=\"reblog-source\"><a href=\"http://sjikkevelo.wordpress.com/2013/06/08/with-kids/\">View original</a></p></div></div>", "post_id": 1295, "location": false, "date": "06-08-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["gaming", "kids", "postaday", "poetry", "sports", "games", "fun", "party"], "text": "<p id=\"article_image\"><span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong><a title=\"Backyard party.\" href=\"http://voices.yahoo.com/image/1443820/index.html\"><span style=\"color:#000080;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/l.yimg.com/ck/image/A1443/1443820/300_1443820.png\" /></span></a></strong></span></p>\n<div id=\"content_header\">\n<h1><span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong>Top 10 Old Fashioned Kids Party Games</strong></span></h1>\n<h2></h2>\n</div>\n<div id=\"content_article\">\n<div id=\"article_text_blocks\"><span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong>Modern kids may never have played some of these old fashioned kids party games. If you don&#8217;t tell kids these are old school, they won&#8217;t know. These games encourage plenty of lively interaction and riots of laughter. Why not teach this gadget-loving generation how to have some good old fashioned fun? Twists are included for some of these old fashioned kids party games.1. Hot Potato</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong> Believe it or not, this old fashioned kids party game was once played with an actual hot potato. The potato was passed quickly from player to player. Whoever dropped it was O-U-T out. Last player standing was the winner. For a modern twist on this burning hot game, how about using a ball and a timer? The person caught holding the ball when the buzzer goes off is out. Reset the timer until all but one player is eliminated.</strong></span><span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong>2. Balloon Race</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong> For this old fashioned kids party game, kids do a relay race with balloons on spoons. It&#8217;s tons of fun just the way it is. How about adding a twist? Once each player reaches the finish, they must pop their balloon before the next player can continue. How do they pop the balloon? By sitting on it, of course. Kids will love this laugh riot of a game.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong>3. Telephone</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong> Isn&#8217;t it funny how a message gets twisted when passed from one person to another? That&#8217;s the premise of the telephone game. In this old fashioned kids party game, children form a line. The first child whispers a phrase in the next child&#8217;s ear. This continues down the line until the last player recites the phrase out loud. The results can be hilarious. This game is twisted enough without any revisions.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong>4. Pin the Tail on the Donkey</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong> Children are blind-folded for this game, but that&#8217;s not enough. Now they must try to pin a paper tail to a paper donkey hanging on the wall. The one closest to the goal wins. We&#8217;re all familiar with this old fashioned kids party game. How about replacing the donkey and tail with a monkey and banana? Monkeys and bananas are always good for a laugh.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong>5. Sack Race</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong> Kids hop into a potato sack for this mad jumping race across the lawn. Do they even make potato sacks any more? I&#8217;m not sure. I guess you could use a garbage bag, but that might bust on the way across the yard. This calls for a modern twist. How about some old pillowcases? They&#8217;re just about the right size for kids to use as potato sack race substitutes.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong>6. Musical Chairs</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong> In the old fashioned kids party game, chairs are placed in a circle, facing outward. Start with one chair less than the number of kids you have. Kids walk around the chairs. Music is played and stopped intermittently. When the music stops, kids scramble to sit. The player left without a chair is out. Another chair is removed and the fun begins again. For a fun twist, why not play some popular dance music? Kids can dance around the chairs in the silliest fashion possible. Prize given to the craziest dancer and the last kid sitting.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong>7. Three Legged Race</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong> This old fashioned kids party game requires teamwork. Players race to the finish line together in teams of two. The old fashioned twist? Their left and right legs are tied together. The &#8220;middle&#8221; combined leg of each team must move together to finish the race. Ready for a challenging twist for older kids? Each player must balance a tennis ball on the palm of their outside hand, without closing their fist.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong>8. Penny Pitch</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong> In the old fashioned party game, kids pitch pennies onto a grid with points marked. Each player gets three pennies to pitch. The one with the highest combined points wins. It&#8217;s a fun game, even without a twist. How about making things a little more challenging for older kids? Position empty cups, bottles and jars on different surface levels with points given for each goal.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong>9. Bean Bag Toss</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong> Toss three bean bags into holes made in a standing piece of plywood. Make a goal and win a prize. Make two goals and win a bigger prize. Three goals, one for each beanbag tossed, gets you the largest prize. That&#8217;s the old fashioned kids party game. How about another twist for older kids? Suspend the plywood from a tree or clothesline outdoors. A spinning goal is much harder to toss bean bags through.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong>10. Animal Charades</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong> This fun, old fashioned kids party game has kids imitating their favorite animals. Each player has a turn imitating an animal, while the other players try to guess the animal. The player that guesses, takes a turn at portraying animals. This game has no prizes but continues on as long as the kids want to play. For a twist, how about a small prize for each correct guess? Older kids can twist the game up a bit by changing the category from animals to movies or song titles, like the adult game of charades.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>SEND YOUR LIST OF OLD FASHIONED GAMES TO ADD TO OUR\u00a0LIST</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>TO poetreecreations@yahoo.com</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n", "post_id": 1297, "location": false, "date": "06-09-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["literature", "postaday", "poetry", "writing", "POSTADAY KIDS", "dads"], "text": "<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-1304\" alt=\"ffffffffffffffffff\" src=\"https://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/ffffffffffffffffff.jpg?w=160&#038;h=137\" width=\"160\" height=\"137\" /><a href=\"http://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/dadssssssssssssssssssssssssss.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1302 alignright\" alt=\"dadssssssssssssssssssssssssss\" src=\"https://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/dadssssssssssssssssssssssssss.jpg?w=158&#038;h=160\" width=\"158\" height=\"160\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>SEND YOUR POETRY IN BEFORE THE 15th OF JUNE</strong></span></p>\n", "post_id": 1301, "location": false, "date": "06-09-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "", "post_id": 1306, "location": false, "date": "06-09-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<div class=\"wpcom-reblog-snapshot\"> <div class=\"reblog-post\"><p class=\"reblog-from\"><img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/25ee28e939800e1002495bcd9ad1e0cd?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />Originally posted on <a href=\"http://justaddwaternow.wordpress.com/2013/06/09/the-most-important-parenting-lesson-that-i-learnt-from-my-own-parents/\">Just Add Water</a>:</p><div class=\"reblogged-content\">\n<p><img class=\"size-full\" src=\"http://justaddwaternow.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/img_0542.jpg\" alt=\"The most important parenting lesson that I learnt from my own parents.\"></p>\n\n<p>My amazing Dad said this during his speech at our wedding.

To minimize such risk, limit what you bring, especially if you are not going to the beach with a group. the less you bring, the less important it is to keep an eye on your stuff.

Parents should not be fooled into thinking that their child is safe just because he/she knows how to swim. In a lot of these cases accidents happened even though the child knew swimming. Accidents in the swimming pool can happen very suddenly without warning. It is very important that all parents follow these basic safety precautions especially if there is a swimming pool at home.</strong></span><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Never allow your youngster to swim alone without any adult supervision.

When I heard &#8220;If you don&#8217;t give me that ice cream, I&#8217;m going to spit on you,&#8221; I felt like shouting &#8212; but instead, I forced myself to bite my tongue. After I regained my composure, I said: &#8220;That&#8217;s not an okay way to talk. It&#8217;s hurtful and unkind. I need you to speak to me with respect, please.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Respect. Thanks to Aretha, we all know how to spell it. But sadly, in today&#8217;s world (where rudeness is so pervasive that even our president gets heckled while making a speech), we no longer expect that everyone will show respect for others. The good news is that we can teach our kids this critical value &#8212; and in doing so, we&#8217;ll end up imparting crucial lessons in kindness, consideration, honesty, open-mindedness, and gratitude as well. The most effective way to teach kids respectful behavior is to model it yourself, says Victoria Kindle Hodson, coauthor of\u00a0<em>Respectful Parents, Respectful Kids</em>. But beyond walking the walk, there are plenty of simple strategies you can use.</p>\n<div></div>\n<h4><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;text-decoration:underline;\">Demand Good Manners</span></span></h4>\n<p>Acting polite isn&#8217;t merely a formality, says psychotherapist Ingrid Schweiger, Ph.D., author of\u00a0<em>Self-Esteem for a Lifetime</em>. &#8220;When kids say &#8216;thanks&#8217; after something is given to them, they acknowledge that there&#8217;s a mutual exchange going on, a give-and-take,&#8221; she explains. And by going through the motions, they eventually learn not to expect the world on a silver platter.</p>\n<p>Even\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.parents.com/toddlers-preschoolers/\">toddlers</a>\u00a0can learn to say &#8220;please&#8221; and &#8220;thank you,&#8221; while preschoolers should be expected to look people in the eye when they greet them and to say &#8220;hello&#8221; and &#8220;goodbye.&#8221; Be prepared to give plenty of gentle reminders. &#8220;When my boys were younger I was constantly cueing them to say &#8216;I&#8217;m sorry&#8217; or &#8216;Excuse me.&#8217; Now, as a result, it mostly comes naturally to them,&#8221; says Debbie Oser, of North Wales, Pennsylvania. But sometimes a nudge isn&#8217;t enough: If you&#8217;re taking your kids someplace that requires a specific kind of behavior (say, your office or an upscale store), make sure they understand what&#8217;s expected of them. &#8220;Before we go out to eat, we review proper manners and warn our kids that if they don&#8217;t act appropriately, they&#8217;ll be removed from the restaurant. And we make sure we follow through with that &#8212; even if we really want to stay,&#8221; says Sarah Natividad, a mom of four in Tooele, Utah.</p>\n<p>When your kids successfully mind their p&#8217;s and q&#8217;s, reinforce their behavior by offering praise &#8212; and mentioning why those\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.parents.com/kids/responsibility/manners/\">good manners</a>\u00a0mattered so much, says Dr. Schweiger. &#8220;I tell my boys, &#8216;It was very nice the way you thanked Tommy&#8217;s mom for the cookies. I know it made her feel appreciated for all of her hard work,&#8217;&#8221; says Patricia Rossia, of Tampa Bay, Florida.</p>\n", "post_id": 132, "location": false, "date": "07-31-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<div class=\"wpcom-reblog-snapshot\"> <div class=\"reblog-post\"><p class=\"reblog-from\"><img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/2a90f12fd01f6b9091cfa9d8ec1704be?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />Originally posted on <a href=\"http://almondellablog.wordpress.com/2013/06/10/time-for-swimming/\">Almondella Blog</a>:</p><div class=\"reblogged-content\">\n<p><a href=\"http://almondellablog.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/baby-swimming-with-mom_shutterstock_5056936-1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image\" src=\"http://almondellablog.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/baby-swimming-with-mom_shutterstock_5056936-1.jpg?w=310\" alt=\"Image\"></a></p>\n\n<p><em>Image source: Shutterstock </em></p>\n\n<p>Have you ever thought of teaching your newborn baby to swim? Basically, baby can start the\u00a0lessons at any age after birth. Surprisingly you\u2019ll see how your baby moves naturally in the water even before he/she can\u00a0walk properly. Babies are floating\u00a0in the womb\u00a0for nine months so they are just continuing\u00a0that natural affinity.</p>\n\n<p>Children who attend regular swimming lessons will gain a respect for water and awareness for water safety and swimming of course is a great form of physical exercise. It\u00a0turns out to more than that, however. For example, a study shows that experiences\u00a0in water at early age allows babies to develop their psychomotor skills such as understanding distance and movement. Baby swimmers have better balance and are better at grasping things\u00a0than non-swimmers. Swimming also enhances their IQ level, creativity as well as\u00a0memory.\u00a0Moreover, from the psychological perspective, swimming can help babies become more self-confident\u00a0and independent in new environment\u2026</p>\n</div><p class=\"reblog-source\"><a href=\"http://almondellablog.wordpress.com/2013/06/10/time-for-swimming/\">View original</a> <span class=\"more-words\">137 more words</span></p></div></div>", "post_id": 1320, "location": false, "date": "06-10-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["gillian", "poems", "giraffe in my bath", "giraffe", "Gillian Sims"], "text": "<p align=\"CENTER\"><strong><a href=\"http://poetreecreations.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/cartoon_giraffe_ornament_or_sculpture_photosculpture-p153221356628908126env3c_400.jpg\"><img title=\"cartoon_giraffe_ornament_or_sculpture_photosculpture-p153221356628908126env3c_400\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://poetreecreations.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/cartoon_giraffe_ornament_or_sculpture_photosculpture-p153221356628908126env3c_400.jpg?w=300&#038;h=300\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a></strong></p>\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>I found a giraffe in my bath</strong></span></p>\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>He was having a wash</strong></span></p>\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>He looked very clean</strong></span></p>\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>And he sounded very posh,</strong></span></p>\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>I didn&#8217;t know his name</strong></span></p>\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>I wasn&#8217;t sure why he was there</strong></span></p>\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>He seemed very polite</strong></span></p>\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>So I didn&#8217;t really care,</strong></span></p>\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>There was a giraffe in my bath</strong></span></p>\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>When I went to have a wash</strong></span></p>\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>I didn&#8217;t know his name</strong></span></p>\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>But he sounded very posh,</strong></span></p>\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>When I asked him to leave</strong></span></p>\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>He didn&#8217;t seem very pleased</strong></span></p>\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>So I left the giraffe in the bath</strong></span></p>\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>I just hope he hadn&#8217;t got a key</strong></span></p>\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Gillian Sims</strong></span></p>\n", "post_id": 1324, "location": false, "date": "06-10-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<div class=\"wpcom-reblog-snapshot\"> <div class=\"reblog-post\"><p class=\"reblog-from\"><img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6f43515705950c110f3c3189bfd04843?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />Originally posted on <a href=\"http://ontheplumtree.wordpress.com/2013/06/10/drnanaplums-rhyme-corner/\">Plum Tree Books Blog</a>:</p><div class=\"reblogged-content\">\n<p><a href=\"http://ontheplumtree.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/dr-nana-plum.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-2550\" src=\"http://ontheplumtree.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/dr-nana-plum.jpg?w=300&#038;h=300\" height=\"300\" width=\"300\" alt=\"Dr Nana Plum\"></a></p>\n\n<p>I love to write in childish rhyme.\u00a0I really do it all the time.

Here are some ways to inject a little fun into every day of the year, and make your children feel treasured always.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong>1. Spend time alone with each of your children. Go out to lunch, take a leisurely walk, or just hang out together letting them know you value them as individuals.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong>2. Nurture self-esteem and self-confidence by praising good effort and a job well done, not just results.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong>3. Celebrate everyday accomplishments. Make a special dinner with your child as the guest of honor to toast losing a tooth, making the soccer team, getting an A on a science paper, and more.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong>4. Teach children to think positive by being positive. Instead of noting how dirty they are when they come in for dinner, say, &#8220;Looks like you had a great time!&#8221;</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong>5. Read &#8220;just one more book&#8221; even if it&#8217;s late and you&#8217;re tired. And don&#8217;t forget to read to older children who already know how to read themselves. It&#8217;s a great opportunity to snuggle.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong>6. Get out the photo albums and their baby books and tell your children stories about their beginnings.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong>7. Remind them of something they&#8217;ve taught you.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong>8. Tell them how wonderful it is being their parent and how much you like the way they&#8217;re growing up.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong>9. Let your children choose their own clothes. It shows you respect their decision-making ability. Besides, everyone will know you didn&#8217;t dress them. You would never mix plaid and stripes!</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong>10. Get messy with your kids: Make snow angels, put your hands in the finger-paint, and mush up that clay.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong>11. Get to know their schedules, friends, and teachers so you can ask, &#8220;Did you and Sam sit together at lunch today?&#8221; or &#8220;What did Mr. Rogers sing in music class?&#8221; instead of simply, &#8220;What did you do today?&#8221;</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong>12. Stop washing the dishes and talking on the phone and really listen when they are talking to you.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong>13. Teach your children to play jacks, use a yo-yo, knit, or do something you loved as a child. Or let your child choose something new you can learn together.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong>14. Bend the rules. Let your children put on their boots and jump in the puddles you usually tell them to avoid.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong>15. Eat dinner together even if it&#8217;s just once a week. Take turns sharing your week&#8217;s accomplishments.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong>16. Cut their sandwiches into shapes with cookie cutter hearts and stars.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong>17. Slip little love notes, jokes, poems, and words of encouragement into your children&#8217;s lunchboxes, backpacks, or next to their beds (if you leave before they wake up), just to let them know you&#8217;re thinking about them all day long.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong>18. Let your children overhear you complimenting them to someone else.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong>19. Wear the &#8220;jewels&#8221; your children make for you and display their artwork proudly in a special, visible place.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong>20. Try not to do all the things your parents did that you vowed never to do to your children.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong>21. Instead of saying, &#8220;You&#8217;re doing it wrong,&#8221; when your child makes a mistake, try saying &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you try it this way.&#8221;</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong>22. Create a secret word, sign, or gesture of affection that only you and your child share.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong>23. Remember to give your children a lasting gift: roots and wings. If they push for independence, take it as the sign of a job well done.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong>24. Forget about yesterday. Start each day fresh. It&#8217;s a new opportunity to have a better relationship with your children and to fall in love with them all over again.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong>25. Hug them, kiss them, and say, &#8220;I love you&#8221; every day, no matter what. Kids thrive on it and it&#8217;s a daily fix we all need no matter what our age</strong></span>!</p>\n</div>\n", "post_id": 1336, "location": false, "date": "06-13-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "", "post_id": 1339, "location": false, "date": "06-13-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<div class=\"wpcom-reblog-snapshot\"> <div class=\"reblog-post\"><p class=\"reblog-from\"><img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/cb82a90c7d7c5012d44f232bc70b8cd0?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />Originally posted on <a href=\"http://everydayisglitterandrainbows.com/2013/06/13/we-bought-new-kids-today/\">Every Day is Glitter and Rainbows</a>:</p><div class=\"reblogged-content\">\n<p>Ok, ok.

It is not money, nor jealousy or even sex.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>It is babysitters.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>You see, a few years ago we made a huge seachange. Leaving Sydney, we packed up our kids and made a new life for ourselves in far north coastal NSW. It was a great decision for us except for one thing, one very important thing that we left behind \u2013 the grandmothers! We left our mums behind. What were we thinking? We also left the aunties, the cousins and the friends with kids. In fact we left everybody we trusted who could possibly babysit our kids if ever we needed. What dopes!</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u201cThat\u2019s OK, it\u2019s just life, it won\u2019t be forever,\u201d says my husband (who has never had a pap smear with three spectators).</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>My husband is against the idea of using a babysitter. Very against. My husband also has a second job as a musician that sees him out of the home \u2018jamming\u2019 (ahem, read drinking beer in a warehouse) and gigging at pubs on the weekends. A job that means he has conversations with people that are older than three years of age who, more often than not, buy him drinks of the alcoholic variety.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>I, on the other hand, work from home with the kids \u2026 in the home \u2026 with me \u2026 twenty four hours a day. All day, every day, no break ever.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>So while the husband has a strong opposition to leaving the children with somebody we don\u2019t know, I have to stop myself grabbing random teens and tempting them to my home with offers of unlimited pizza and permission to snog their \u201cboifs\u201d in my lounge room.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>It\u2019s fine right? Everybody does it. I mean, the husband didn\u2019t read the Baby-sitters Club books growing up. That\u2019s probably why he is so opposed. If he did, he\u2019d know that those kids were, what, seven? Everybody in their whole town let them babysit their kids!</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Truth be told, I\u2019m not actually sure what I\u2019d do if I got a break. I\u2019ve spent so much time invested in the for-and-against argument for the cause that I\u2019ve forgotten what I am meant to do if I actually win this battle. Can you get a babysitter for sole purpose of having a bath and shaving both legs?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Regardless, my journey has led me to some useful information, and if you are in the market for offloading leaving your children to the care of a trusted individual you might find this handy, too.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>This is great advice from Ella Walsh that covers pretty much everything you need to know about getting started with a babysitter</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Choosing a babysitter</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>As a general rule of thumb, the younger the child being cared for, the more mature you want the babysitter to be. You need to find someone who has the right amount of maturity, but who can still have fun with your child. And while there is no legal minimum age for babysitters, and young people mature at different ages, generally a young child needs a mature adult who is capable of attending to all their needs.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>The older the charge, the less hands-on help they need, so the younger the babysitter can be. Generally, a sixteen year-old who can easily look after your eight year-old, will find caring for an eight month-old beyond their capabilities.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Obviously, age isn\u2019t the only thing you need to consider when choosing a babysitter. If you are considering employing a babysitter who is unknown to you, ask for references \u2013 and then make sure that you ring and check them.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>What should I ask a prospective babysitter?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>While you interview any would-be babysitter, always keep in mind that they will be spending time with your children, so ultimately you\u2019ve got to try to judge whether your child will enjoy their company \u2013 do they have a suitable temperament? Do you think your child will click with them? Are they engaging to talk to? Beyond that, you should also ask some practical questions to see if they tick all your boxes:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Do you have any references?</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>What is your previous experience looking after children? What ages were they?</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Do you have any first aid training?</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>What would you do in an emergency?</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>What do you like best about babysitting?</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>What would you do if you were unsure about how to handle a situation?</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>What are you interested in doing with my child while I\u2019m absent?</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>REMEMBER!</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>This is your chance to get to know your babysitter \u2013 ask all the questions you want to, even if they do seem trivial.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>How much should I pay my babysitter?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Babysitting rates are usually hourly, and can vary from babysitter to babysitter. When you\u2019re negotiating a rate, consider the following:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>How many children will they be looking after?</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>What are the ages of the children (how much hands-on care will they be required to give)?</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>How long will you need to hire them for?</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Will their rate increase for any time worked after midnight?</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>What do other families in the neighbourhood pay?</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>How old is your babysitter and how much experience do they have?</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>If your babysitter is young (and can\u2019t drive), organise with them beforehand how they will be getting to and from your house.</strong></span></p>\n", "post_id": 1345, "location": false, "date": "06-14-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<div class=\"wpcom-reblog-snapshot\"> <div

In 2010, around 19 child pedestrians (aged 0-11) were killed or seriously injured every week in Britain. The Green Cross Code is taught in schools but needs to be reinforced from home &#8211; and not just by memorising the words, but by parents practicing and explaining the code to their children. Do you know it? Do you follow it? The code is for everyone.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#339966;\"><strong>The Green Cross Code</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#339966;\"><strong>1. First find the safest place to cross</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#339966;\"><strong>If possible, cross the road at: subways, footbridges, islands, zebra, puffin, pelican or toucan crossings, or where there is a crossing point controlled by a police officer, a school crossing patrol or a traffic warden.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#339966;\"><strong>Otherwise, choose a place where you can see clearly in all directions, and where drivers can see you.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#339966;\"><strong>Try to avoid crossing between parked cars and on sharp bends or close to the top of a hill. Move to a space where drivers and riders can see you clearly.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#339966;\"><strong>There should be space to reach the pavement on the other side. </strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#339966;\"><strong>2. Stop just before you get to the kerb</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#339966;\"><strong>Do not get too close to the traffic. If there is no pavement, keep back from the edge of the road but make sure you can still see approaching traffic.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#339966;\"><strong>Give yourself lots of time to have a good look all around.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#339966;\"><strong>3. Look all around for traffic and listen</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#339966;\"><strong>Look all around for traffic and listen.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#339966;\"><strong>Look in every direction.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#339966;\"><strong>Listen carefully because you can sometimes hear traffic before you can see it.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#339966;\"><strong>4. If traffic is coming, let it pass</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#339966;\"><strong>Look all around again and listen.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#339966;\"><strong>Do not cross until there is a safe gap in the traffic and you are certain that there is plenty of time.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#339966;\"><strong>Remember, even if traffic is a long way off, it may be approaching very quickly.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#339966;\"><strong>5. When it is safe, go straight across the road \u2013 do not run</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#339966;\"><strong>Keep looking and listening for traffic while you cross, in case there is any traffic you did not see, or in case other traffic appears suddenly. </strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#339966;\"><strong>Look out for cyclists and motorcyclists traveling between lanes of traffic. </strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#339966;\"><strong>Do not cross diagonally.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#339966;\"><strong>How you can help your child and other children</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#339966;\"><strong>Set a good example. Use the Green Cross Code yourself.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#339966;\"><strong>Show your child how to use the Code to cross the road when you\u2019re out and about.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#339966;\"><strong>Let your child show you that they know how to cross the road safely \u2013 start practising on quiet roads first.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#339966;\"><strong>Point out dangerous places to cross on local roads. Point out safer places as well. Some places may be safer at some times of the day than at others.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#339966;\"><strong>Use pedestrian crossings even if it involves a small detour.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#339966;\"><strong>Talk about the importance of not using a mobile phone or texting while crossing the road.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#339966;\"><strong>Remind your child that they cannot hear traffic if listening to music through earphones or see it properly if wearing a large hood.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#339966;\"><strong>But let\u2019s get one thing clear: it\u2019s still important for children to be outside. </strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#339966;\"><strong>Walking is good for children&#8217;s health and fitness and we support parents who encourage their children to walk as much as possible. Taking your child in the car for short journeys puts more traffic on the road and adds to the problem.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#339966;\"><strong>Children can be safer on the streets if we show them how.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#339966;\"><strong>Crossing between parked cars</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#339966;\"><strong>Try not to cross between parked vehicles, but if there is nowhere else to cross:</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#339966;\"><strong>Choose a place where there is a space between two cars and make sure that it is easy to get to the pavement on the other side of the road.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#339966;\"><strong>Make sure neither car is about to move off &#8211; look for drivers in the cars, lights and listen for engines.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#339966;\"><strong>Don&#8217;t cross near large vehicles. You could be standing in a blind spot, where the driver cannot see you.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#339966;\"><strong>Walk to the outside edge of the cars and stop. Here you can be seen by drivers and you can look all around for traffic.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#339966;\"><strong>Use the Green Cross Code.

of work goes into making a good sand sculpture. Sculptors need patience and endurance to create their masterpieces from thousands of tonnes of sand.\u00a0 They can take up to two months to build and span up to 10 metres in height.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Sculptors use a special kind of sand that is also used on building sites and was most likely used in the foundations of your home. It is called heavy sand and is different to the sand you see on the beach because each grain is square, which means it sticks together better, like building blocks.\u00a0 The sand on the beach is smoother and rounder so it doesn\u2019t stay together quite as well.\u00a0 Some beaches are located near the mouths of rivers have better sand for sculpting as it isn\u2019t worn down by the surf.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>The most important part of making a sand sculpture is the preparation, or what sculptors call \u201cpound up\u201d.\u00a0 Pound up involves building wooden walls in a square or rectangle shape.\u00a0 These walls are called \u201cforms\u201d and are about two feet tall.\u00a0 After the forms are built they are filled with sand, like a giant sandpit, right to the top.\u00a0 When the forms are full, sculptors set to work making sure that the sand is pounded down as hard as possible by whacking it, jumping on it and watering it.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Water is REALLY important; the water helps the sand stick together and helps it to set hard as it dries out.\u00a0 Successive forms are built on top of the first and compacted down so that eventually you have what looks a bit like a wooden pyramid of forms, as high as is required, all filled to the brim with sand that has been pushed down into them.\u00a0 When pounding up a couple of thousand tonnes of sand, this process can take weeks but care is very important because if the sand isn\u2019t compacted hard enough the sculpture might collapse later.\u00a0 After the sand has had time to set the sculptors climb up, take off the top form, and begin to carve into the sand block left behind.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>When you are on the beach this summer you might not have the time (or equipment!) to make forms but a bucket is the next best thing.\u00a0 Fill your bucket with sand that is damp, not too wet and not too dry but somewhere in between is best, then push the sand down as hard as you can into the bucket.\u00a0 Be careful of the strength of your bucket because too much pressure can crack it just as forms sometimes do when too much pressure is exerted on them.\u00a0 Once you are happy with your pound up, find a good spot on the beach, flip your bucket over and very carefully remove it, leaving the sand behind on the ground.\u00a0 Now you have the beginnings of your sculpture.\u00a0 If you want to go the extra step ask your parents if they have an old bucket that they can cut the bottom out of, that way you can start with your bucket upside down and fill the sand in from the top.\u00a0 This allows you to build up on top of each layer that you pound up with cups and containers like the professionals do with their smaller forms.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Now the fun part \u2013 carving.\u00a0 Carving gives the sculpture all of its detail and character.\u00a0 You can use almost anything to carve and most of the professional sculptors actually use cooking and dental utensils.\u00a0 You better ask your parents before you start using their icing scraper at the beach though.\u00a0 There are loads of tools you can use to help you carve out a work of art from icy-pole sticks to house keys (again you better ask before you try that one) and even water pistols can be used to cut a hole through the middle of your pile.\u00a0 Try to visualise what you want to carve out before you get started and then go wild!</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>If you can get one, a water spray bottle is a great idea to have handy while you are carving to keep the sand damp.\u00a0 Every once in a while, give your sculpture a couple of sprays so it doesn\u2019t dry out. The rest is up to you.\u00a0 Try using stuff you find on the beach like sea shells and sea weed.</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n", "post_id": 1406, "location": false, "date": "07-01-2013", "mentions":

But before you turn on the A/C, read these tips on ways to keep costs down during a heatwave.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Beating the heat doesn\u2019t have to mean cranking the A/C \u2014 air conditioning is really hard on the budget, not to mention the power grid. This summer, consider these 12 frugal tips to keep you cool in the hot weather \u2014 they\u2019ll not only save you money, but will make your home greener too.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>1. Get grilling</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>When it\u2019s hot outside, using your oven or stovetop can make your house even hotter. Stop sweating in the kitchen and make use of your barbecue whenever you can. You can use the grill for everything \u2014 even pizza.\u00a0</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>2. Adjust your thermostat </strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Try not to leave the AC running when you\u2019re not home. There are other ways to keep your house from heating up too much (see below). Also, consider saving the air conditioning for the very hottest days of summer \u2014 and use it sparingly, such as turning it off when you\u2019re sleeping.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>3. Change your filters</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>If you have central air, make sure you give your system a once-over and change the filters so that it runs more efficiently and pumps clean air through your home.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>4. Keep the curtains closed</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Keep your windows curtained or shuttered during the heat of the day \u2014 that will also help the air stay cooler when the sunshine is at its peak.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>5. Use fans</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Ceiling fans and portable fans will keep the air circulating through your home so that it stays cooler and fresher.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>6. Cover the vents</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>If you are running AC, make sure you cover the vents in rooms you don\u2019t use to push the cold air where you want it \u2014 especially at night. Covering the downstairs vents can make your upper floors cooler when you\u2019re sleeping.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>7. Camp out</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Hot nights can be the hardest part of summer, so why not get out of your upstairs bedroom and sleep somewhere cooler? Set up camp in the backyard or in the basement \u2014 if you have young kids, you can also make it fun by pitching a tent and making it like a camping trip.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>8. Use cold showers </strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Bring down your body temperature before bed by taking a cold shower or bath. It will help make you more comfortable and help you get to sleep even on the hottest nights. To get super cool before bed, stand in front of a fan to dry off instead of using a towel \u2014 that gives your body an extra chill that will keep you cooler for longer.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Advertisement</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>9. Peg out </strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Your dryer makes your home even hotter, so use your clothesline instead. Pegging out can also help cut your electricity bill. And you get an added bonus \u2014 clothes dried outside smell so much better.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>10. Get a pool (kiddie that is)</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Every kid on my block had a Mr. Turtle Pool when I was growing up \u2014 kid-sized pools are a great way for your little ones to keep cool. Adults and pets can also cool their heels in the cold water when they need it. If your kids are too small to play safely in a kiddie pool, then turn on the sprinkler to cool them down.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>11. Have lots of cold ones\u2026</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Keep yourself well hydrated with cold, icy beverages, preferably non-alcoholic \u2014 while a cold beer or two goes down smoothly on a hot day, the alcohol can leave you dehydrated and feeling even worse.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>12. Make homemade popsicles with the kids</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Packaged popsicles and ice creams are expensive \u2014 enlist your kids in helping you make popsicles of their own. You can also make your own cones and drumsticks \u2014 they taste better than the ones you buy at the store.</strong></span></p>\n", "post_id": 1447, "location": false, "date": "07-07-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["skin cancer deaths", "SAFE KIDS", "history of skin cancer", "SUN POSTADAY", "clinical dermatology research"], "text": "<h1 style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/kids-in-sun.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1453\" alt=\"KIDS IN SUN\" src=\"https://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/kids-in-sun.jpg?w=500&#038;h=334\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" /></a></h1>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Avoid risks like skin damage and cancer, or melanoma, this summer by seeking shade, wearing shirts, hats, sunglasses \u2013 and, of course, sunscreen</strong></span></h3>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></div>\n<div id=\"article-image\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.metroparent.com/images/cache/120656c24b8b7598d820bb7bcad4b426.jpeg\" /></strong></span></div>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>When another bleak Michigan winter is done, families are eager to soak up the warm weather. But not so fast. Several hours of fun in the sun can lead to a lifetime of damaged skin, premature aging and skin cancer, or melanoma, dermatologists warn. Understand the risks \u2013 and how to avoid shield your children from them.</strong></span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>The risks</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Aside from skin cancers, long-term sun exposure is responsible for changes in the skin&#8217;s texture, color, blood supply and development.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>&#8220;The majority of sun damage occurs during childhood,&#8221; says Dr. Linda Stein Gold, director of clinical dermatology research at\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.henryfordhealth.org/\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Henry Ford Hospital</span></a>\u00a0in Detroit. &#8220;Children can still have fun, but it&#8217;s important to protect them in the sun.&#8221;</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>The\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.aad.org/\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">American Academy of Dermatology</span></a>, or AAD, estimates that kids get 80 percent of their total sun damage by age 18.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Several factors increase the skin cancer risk: fair complexion, family history of skin cancer, multiple or atypical moles and excessive exposure to UV radiation. The AAD says several bad childhood sunburns may lay the foundation for skin cancer and recommends keeping infants under 6 months out of direct sunlight.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Melanoma accounts for only about 4 percent of skin cancer cases but causes the majority of skin cancer deaths. However, when caught early and treated early, most patients do very well. Melanoma is the No. 1 cancer for young adults ages 25-29, and the second-most common cancer for ages 15-25.</strong></span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Think location</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>You don&#8217;t have to sunbathe to damage your skin. Participating in outdoor sports can cause overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) light, which can lead to skin cancer, as well as premature aging. Baseball, golf and tennis players often are played during the midday sun, when the sun&#8217;s damaging rays are the strongest.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Indoor tanning beds also carry a risk. &#8220;It&#8217;s important that teens avoid tanning beds,&#8221; says Stein Gold. &#8220;They have the same UV light that causes skin cancer and wrinkling, which will make you look older.&#8221;</strong></span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Protection vitals</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>&#8220;Make sure you protect your child&#8217;s skin,&#8221; says West Bloomfield dermatologist D&#8217;Anne Kleinsmith. &#8220;They&#8217;ll thank you for it later.&#8221;</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Dermatologists use a series of S&#8217;s to remind their patients about sun safety: seek shade, slip on a shirt, slop on sunscreen, slap on a hat, and wear sunglasses.</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>&#8220;Seek shade,&#8221; especially in the middle of the day when the sun&#8217;s rays are strongest.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>&#8220;Slip on a shirt&#8221; reminds people to use protective clothing to guard as much skin as possible when outdoors. Newer sun protective fabrics are lightweight and provide coverage.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>&#8220;Sun protective clothing is great, even while swimming,&#8221; says Stein Gold. &#8220;Also, wear hat and sunglasses for full protection.&#8221; Kleinsmith adds that the type of hat counts: Wide-brimmed styles provide shade to sensitive areas like the ears and neck, and the material makes a difference, too. &#8220;Tighter weave fabrics block more sun,&#8221; she says.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>&#8220;Slop on sunscreen&#8221; means apply a generous amount (about a shot-glass full) before going outdoors and reapply after swimming, toweling dry or sweating. Use sunscreen even on hazy or overcast days. Stein Gold recommends sunscreens with a minimum of SPF 15. &#8220;Also look for those with UVA and UVB coverage,&#8221; she says. &#8220;Reapply every two hours, and more frequently if swimming.&#8221;</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>What about vitamin D?</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Among dermatologists, there is some discussion about the risks versus the potential benefits of sun exposure. Vitamin D is produced in the body by exposure to sunlight. Although our bodies need vitamin D to build and maintain strong and healthy bodies, most dermatologists do not recommend getting vitamin D from natural sunlight exposure or from artificial indoor tanning lights.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>&#8220;The American Academy of Dermatology feels that you should get vitamin D safely through a healthy diet that may include vitamin supplements,&#8221; Stein Gold says. &#8220;Don&#8217;t seek the sun.&#8221;</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>The AAD believes that getting vitamin D from a balanced diet including vitamin D-fortified foods and beverages, or from vitamin supplements and practicing sun protection, is a healthier alternative. Good dietary sources of vitamin D include fortified milk, cheeses and yogurt, fortified cereal and oily fish like salmon and tuna.</strong></span></p>\n", "post_id": 1452, "location": false, "date": "07-07-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["chocolate soda", "COLD DRINKS", "postaday", "italian chocolate", "lemonade recipe", "ICE TEA", "summer cocktail recipes", "iced coffee recipe", "caramel syrup"], "text": "<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><a href=\"http://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/cranberry_mocktail.jpg\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1456\" alt=\"Cranberry_Mocktail\" src=\"https://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/cranberry_mocktail.jpg?w=474&#038;h=294\" width=\"474\" height=\"294\" /></span></a></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">: Cold Coffee Drink Recipes Easy Summer Drinks Summer Party Ideas Summer Barbecue Summer Recipes</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">The best remedy for scorching hot weather is a tall glass of something ice cold.

Although\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.thekitchn.com/thekitchn/breakfast/recipe-low-sugar-high-protien-dairy-free-smoothie--085141\">smoothie</a>\u00a0shops sell you ridiculously large portions, a small 12 ounces is enough to get some serious nutrition without leaving you with a growly stomach.</p>\n<p><b>3. Frozen Grapes:</b>\u00a0There is a\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.thekitchn.com/thekitchn/ingredients-fruit/hot-weather-treat-frozen-grapes-092529\">severe cult following</a>\u00a0for this simple snack, just toss any bunch of grapes straight in the freezer. The end result is something that requires chewing and has a pleasant tang without being a milk-based dessert or snack.</p>\n<p><b>4. Cold Noodle Dishes:</b>\u00a0It might be Soba or some Buckwheat noodles, but either way you can create sauces with big flavor and deliver them in a crisp, cool manner. Check out\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.thekitchn.com/thekitchn/search?q=cold+noodles\">more cold noodle dishes here</a>.</p>\n<p><b>5. Ice Cream:</b>\u00a0Although it might not offer anything nutritionally, it is still the go to snack for many that are staring high temperatures in the face.\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.thekitchn.com/thekitchn/ice-cream/whats-the-difference-ice-cream-gelato-sorbet-and-granita-119657\">A cool bowl</a>\u00a0of almost any flavor is usually more than welcome (even if it&#8217;s only breakfast!).</p>\n<p><b>6. Water:</b>\u00a0Even though you don&#8217;t eat water (though we&#8217;ve lived in some cities we swore we did), it&#8217;s a great way to cool down your insides and put off hunger for a little while longer until you&#8217;re ready to consume a real meal instead of snacking.</p>\n<p><b>7. Spicy Foods:</b>\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.thekitchn.com/thekitchn/do-you-eat-spicy-food-in-hot-weather-091959\">Many will tell you</a>\u00a0that a good and spicy curry (Indian or Thai) is the way to go because it makes you sweat. We&#8217;re still not 100% sure of the science behind this method, so if it works for you, awesome, if not, see number 5!</p>\n<p><b>8. Jerky:</b>\u00a0Although there&#8217;s tons of fresh fruit available during the sweltering heat, you might not always want the sugar (even if natural) that comes with it. A nibble of<a href=\"http://www.thekitchn.com/thekitchn/tips-techniques/how-to-make-blank-slate-beef-jerky-088618\">homemade jerky</a>\u00a0is a great alternative, plus gives you some substance unlike some of the other options above.</p>\n<p><b>9. Watermelon:</b>\u00a0Growing up, Sunday dinner in the summer was 1/4 or 1/2 of a watermelon and a spoon. We&#8217;re not sure if it was the cool melon itself that made us feel better or the eating process where we got a fare amount of it on us during the process, but either way, watermelon is slushy and juicy without busting out a blender!</p>\n<p><b>10. Spring Rolls:</b>\u00a0We have to say up front that any food shaped like a burrito is a winner in our book, but when the summer sun heats up,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.thekitchn.com/thekitchn/stay-cool/great-summer-meal-homemade-spring-rolls-094240\">spring rolls</a>\u00a0are an easy dish to throw together, especially if you take a few minutes to do the prep work ahead of time. Add your choice of protein and you have a complete meal without adding any heat!</p>\n</div>\n", "post_id": 1463, "location": false, "date": "07-08-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<div class=\"wpcom-reblog-snapshot\"> <div class=\"reblog-post\"><p class=\"reblog-from\"><img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/825354727c659b8789150aae2d73c435?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />Originally posted on <a href=\"http://leanladiescamp.com/2013/07/08/the-mediterranean-food-pyramid-lifestyle-not-a-diet/\">Body By Mags</a>:</p><div class=\"reblogged-content\">\n<p><img class=\"size-full\" src=\"http://leanladiescamp.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/med_pyramid_flyer.jpg\" alt=\"The Mediterranean Food Pyramid: Lifestyle, Not a Diet\"></p>\n\n<p>I was quite fascinated when I came across the image of the Mediterranean Food Pyramid this weekend. We all wonder what is the secret of the \u201cSouthern European\u201d diet that keeps people slim, healthy, happy and living long lives. Notice that the base of the pyramid consists of \u201cactive lifestyle\u201d elements: dancing, going for a walk, playing soccer, and enjoying good food together. It is a lifestyle, not a diet. While a lot of us here in the US workout religiously, sweat in the gym, run marathons, and consume the latest superfoods, we are missing out on the most important part of our potential: simple, active, happy lifestyle. No gym required. Enjoying life to its fullest. Savoring delicious foods with family and friends, and not worrying about how many calories our dinner had.

I am going to share with you 10 quick and easy ways to do just that. Providing you have the ingredients at hand, none of these ideas should take more than a few minutes to prepare.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>01. Nuts About Ice Cream &#8211; One of the easiest ways to spice up your ice cream is to buy a bag of your favourite nuts or a bag of mixed nuts if you prefer. Put a little hole in the bag (but not big enough for the nuts to come out) and compress until all the air is removed, then take something hard and smash the nuts up in the bag. Simply sprinkle the broken nuts onto your ice cream and mix them in.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>02. Strawberry, Coconut Ice Cream &#8211; Something I like to make which is really easy and the kids love, chop up some fresh strawberries and place in a mixer with some vanilla ice cream and then add a bag of coconut flakes. Mix for a few seconds but don&#8217;t overdo it. This ice cream is really good inside chocolate eclairs.\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>03. Oooh, Saucy Ice Cream &#8211; Most people would use some sauces to liven up their ice cream, but the usual chocolate or strawberry sauce can become a bit tedious. I like to use some sauces which are a bit different: apple sauce, lemon sauce, honey or syrup, mocha chocolate sauce, caramel sauce or rhubarb sauce.\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>04. Marshmallow, Chocolate and Honey Ice Cream &#8211; Take a bag of mini marshmallows and slowly mix them into some vanilla ice cream along with a crushed up bar of chocolate and a few drizzles of honey. Garnish with a sprig of mint. This idea is perfect if you are trying to impress party guests or even your partner.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>05. Banana Splits &#8211; This is probably one of the easiest things to make but some people never do. Slice a peeled banana in half (lengthways) and place in a dish. Add a few scoops of your favourite ice cream (vanilla is probably my favourite). Squirt a little squirty cream around the banana and ice cream then sprinkle a few broken nuts and drizzle a little strawberry sauce or honey over the top to finish it off.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>06. Peanut Butter Jelly Ice Cream &#8211; One of Kathy&#8217;s favourite things is peanut butter so I made this ice cream for her and she absolutely loved it. Take some vanilla ice cream and add a few spoonfulls of peanut butter and also a few spoonfulls of your favourite jelly, mix gently to combine, but not too much. Serve in a bowl with wafers and sprinkle a few chopped nuts over the top.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>07. Apricot Ice Cream &#8211; If you are partial to apricots then this one is for you. Take a few dried apricots and chop into tiny pieces and mix into your favourite vanilla ice cream along with some apricot sauce. This is really good when your sat outside on hot, sunny days.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>08. Cookies and Ice Cream &#8211; Cookies are a really good snack, but cookie dough ice cream is much better. Either make your own chocolate chip cookie dough or use Nestle&#8217;s Toll House ready made cookie dough and break it up into pieces and mix with some vanilla ice cream, delicious. You may also want to drizzle a little caramel sauce over the top too.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>09. Fresh Mint Ice Cream &#8211; This is one of my personal favourites because I love the taste of fresh mint. Take about 6 or 7 sprigs of mint and chop very finely or use a blender (saves time) then mix into your vanilla ice cream. I like to place this back into the freezer for 30 minutes or so to allow the mint flavour to penetrate the ice cream.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>10. Rum and Raisin Ice Cream &#8211; This is for adults only. Soak a couple of handfulls of raisins in some rum overnight then add the raisins and the remaining rum into your vanilla ice cream and mix until the ice cream turns a light brown colour (add a little more rum if needed). We recommend not driving after this one.</strong></span></p>\n", "post_id": 1467, "location": false, "date": "07-08-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "", "post_id": 1470, "location": false, "date": "07-08-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["food", "brilliant plan", "cooking", "poetry postaday", "poems", "cream man", "limericks"], "text": "<h1 style=\"text-align:center;\"></h1>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>The Old Ice Cream Man</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/fullxfull-425484844_7pus.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-1474\" alt=\"fullxfull.425484844_7pus\" src=\"https://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/fullxfull-425484844_7pus.jpg?w=150&#038;h=139\" width=\"150\" height=\"139\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>There once was an old ice cream man</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>who thought he had a brilliant plan.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>To increase his money,</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>he&#8217;d also sell honey.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>But the kids saw the bees, and ran!</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>by Dessa Lim\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Sly Slick</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/ice-cream-dog.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1473\" alt=\"ice cream dog\" src=\"https://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/ice-cream-dog.jpg?w=160&#038;h=120\" width=\"160\" height=\"120\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>A girl eating ice cream got tricked</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>by her own sneaky dog named Slick.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>When she wasn&#8217;t looking,</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Sly Slick started licking,</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Then all that was left was the stick.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>by Dessa Lim\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n", "post_id": 1472, "location": false, "date": "07-08-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["sun", "postaday", "skin cancers", "poetry", "TAN", "dogs and cats"], "text": "<div>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/amyface031906.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1479\" alt=\"AmyFace031906\" src=\"https://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/amyface031906.jpg?w=357&#038;h=300\" width=\"357\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>where&#8217;s my sun tan oil</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n<div id=\"abm\">\n<div id=\"abc\">\n<div id=\"articlebody\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">Over the last 20 years or so, there has been increased interest, education and products available to protect people from sunburn. News and increased knowledge about various skin cancers have helped people shift from the &#8220;healthy tan&#8221; mindset to total skin care and protection from the sun&#8217;s rays, starting at infancy.Now the sun skin care attention is turning to our pets. White animals and those that have a hair cut or naturally thin (or nonexistent) hair coats are particularly sensitive to the sun, and may suffer the same ills as humans: sunburn and skin cancers. This Quick Tip offers ideas and cautions for protecting your pet on those sunny days. The two most important tips to prevent sunburn: provide shade and sunblock.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><b>Provide shade</b></span></p>\n<ul style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<ul>Availability of shade and fresh water should be available at all times to keep your pet comfortable and</ul>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><a href=\"http://vetmedicine.about.com/od/summerheathhazards/tp/summerhazards.htm\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">prevent heat stoke</span></a></span></p>\n<ul style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<ul>. This is obvious, but for outdoor pets, if their quarters can be fully shaded (such as a kennel), risks of sun damage are greatly reduced. Consider a sun block top for outdoor housing.</ul>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><a href=\"http://erclk.about.com/?zi=8/1nyA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">Compare and shop for shades</span></a><b>Provide sunblock</b></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"> Like humans, pets should have sunblock applied to sun-sensitive areas such as tips of ears, nose the belly and groin areas that typically have sparse hair coverage and thinner skin. Cats love to sunbathe and some dogs will too, belly up. Additionally, many people get &#8220;summer cuts&#8221; for their cats and dogs to reduce matting and keep the pets comfortable in the summer heat. Sunburn is a definite possibility, and groomers should warn pet owners of this possibility.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">What products are safe to use for pets? It should be remembered that dogs and especially cats are adept at licking off topical lotions, sprays and creams. These substances can be toxic for dogs and especially for cats. It was once recommended that anything safe for human babies would be OK to use on pets with supervision (let the lotion soak in before licking can occur), and that is a guideline, but with the following considerations in mind.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">Using products on a species not covered by product usage guidelines is off-label usage.\u00a0<i>Please consult with your veterinarian prior to using any human products or medications on your pet.</i>Toxicities resulting from off-label usage by pet owners was the number one pet health insurance claim in a\u00a0<a href=\"http://vetmedicine.about.com/od/toxicology/a/poison_claims.htm\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">survey by VPI</span></a>. It is very important to read all instructions and directions before applying any product to your pet.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><b>Pet sunscreen tips:</b></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>1) Use pet-safe sunscreens if possible</strong>\u00a0As of this writing, only one has FDA approval, and that is\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.epi-pet.com/index.asp?PageAction=Custom&amp;ID=53\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">Epi-Pet Sun Protector</span></a>. This is great news for dogs and horses, but unfortunately is not able to be used on cats. A feline sunscreen is being worked on, however, hopefully out within a year. I spoke with Lisa, the marketing director for Epi-Pet, and she said that two of the ingredients commonly used in sunscreens break down in cats to\u00a0<i>salicylic acid</i>, a.k.a<a href=\"http://vetmedicine.about.com/od/veterinaryqa/a/cats-aspirin.htm\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">aspirin</span></a>, a known\u00a0<i>toxin for cats</i>.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>2) Feline sunscreen protection is trickier</strong>\u00a0Avoid products with Octyl Salicylate, Homosalate and Ethylhexyl Salicylate (common sunscreen ingredients). Products containing\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/chemicals/chem_profiles/titanium_dioxide/health_td.html#_1_2\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">Titanium Dioxide</span></a>\u00a0as an active ingredient are OK to use on ear tips and noses. This ingredient works by physically blocking the sun&#8217;s harmful rays, so it is not absorbed (much) by the skin. (This is in contrast to sunblocks that work to chemically block the sun&#8217;s ray.) The Epi-Pet spokeswoman said that this compound is toxic if ingested, so caution is advised.</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n", "post_id": 1477, "location": false, "date": "07-09-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<div class=\"wpcom-reblog-snapshot\"> <div class=\"reblog-post\"><p class=\"reblog-from\"><img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0fc3fb843080b08cc71dbd7a8b9ad0de?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />Originally posted on <a href=\"http://cynicaldaddy.wordpress.com/2013/07/09/42/\">Cynical Daddy</a>:</p><div class=\"reblogged-content\">\n<p>On many occasions I\u2019ve been allowed to be left to my own devices.

These will be your petals.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"cms:500644447\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div><a title=\"Curl A Petal \" href=\"http://www.channel4.com/media/images/Channel4/4homes/design-and-style/how-to-guides/how-to-make-a-rose-with-icing/step-3-roll-lg.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img alt=\"Curl A Petal \" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.channel4.com/media/images/Channel4/4homes/design-and-style/how-to-guides/how-to-make-a-rose-with-icing/step-3-roll-lg_A4.jpg\" />\u00a0</a></div>\n<div>\n<p><strong>Step Three: Curl A Petal To Create The Rose Centre</strong></p>\n<p>Lift the plastic back and look for the smallest one that you\u2019ve created, to be the centre of your rose. Using one finger, carefully rub it from the blunt end. If you&#8217;re gentle, it should stay in one piece as it comes off and it should automatically put a nice curl in the petal. Hold it between your thumb and finger and then gently, starting on one side, curl it right up over itself to form the centre of the rose.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"cms:500644444\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div><a title=\"Add The Other Petals\" href=\"http://www.channel4.com/media/images/Channel4/4homes/design-and-style/how-to-guides/how-to-make-a-rose-with-icing/step-4-second-petal-lg.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img alt=\"Add The Other Petals\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.channel4.com/media/images/Channel4/4homes/design-and-style/how-to-guides/how-to-make-a-rose-with-icing/step-4-second-petal-lg_A4.jpg\" />\u00a0</a></div>\n<div>\n<p><strong>Step Four: Add The Other Petals</strong></p>\n<p>Now take your second petal from the sheeting and lay it over your finger. Lay the first petal in the centre of the second one, join side down. As you squeeze the second one around, it will form the next petal. Curl the tip down and then pinch around the sides to keep it together. Continue in this way with more petals until you have a convincing looking rose.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"cms:500644442\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div><a title=\"Dust It With Glitter\" href=\"http://www.channel4.com/media/images/Channel4/4homes/design-and-style/how-to-guides/how-to-make-a-rose-with-icing/step-5-glitter-lg.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img alt=\"Dust It With Glitter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.channel4.com/media/images/Channel4/4homes/design-and-style/how-to-guides/how-to-make-a-rose-with-icing/step-5-glitter-lg_A4.jpg\" />\u00a0</a></div>\n<div>\n<p><strong>Step Five: Dust It With Glitter</strong></p>\n<p>Now comes the fun part &#8211; because we get to dust it down with glitter.

Fill a piping bag with royal icing and, instead of using a nozzle, just cut a V shape off at the end of the bag. This will allow you to pipe a leaf shape because, as you&#8217;ll see in the next step, the pointed centre of the V will draw a line, forming the central &#8216;vein&#8217; of your leaf &#8211; and the icing will splay out either side, forming the leaf&#8217;s &#8216;blades&#8217;.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"cms:500644439\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div><a title=\"Create The Leaves\" href=\"http://www.channel4.com/media/images/Channel4/4homes/design-and-style/how-to-guides/how-to-make-a-rose-with-icing/step-7-leaf-finishing-lg.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img alt=\"Create The Leaves\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.channel4.com/media/images/Channel4/4homes/design-and-style/how-to-guides/how-to-make-a-rose-with-icing/step-7-leaf-finishing-lg_A4.jpg\" />\u00a0</a></div>\n<div>\n<p><strong>Step Seven: Create The Leaves</strong></p>\n<p>Squeezing gently, drag the piping bag towards yourself, pushing back every couple of millimetres to make the leaf wavy.

Open one of the pegs and clamp around the wire just below the jack plug of your headphones. If the jack plug doesn\u2019t fall through the end, you\u2019re onto a winner. If it does, you\u2019ll need to get some slightly smaller pegs.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://thisisknockout.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/step-2.jpg\"><img alt=\"Step 2\" src=\"https://thisisknockout.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/step-2.jpg?w=640&amp;h=566\" width=\"640\" height=\"566\" /></a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Get taping:</strong>\u00a0Bare wooden pegs are OK but you\u2019ll want to add a bit of colour and fun to your cable tidy. To do this add some washi tape down one side of each of the pegs. Pick your favourite colours or patterns, I went for some black and white dots, but you could try neons, or pastels which would look great against the light wood.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://thisisknockout.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/step-3.jpg\"><img alt=\"Step 3\" src=\"https://thisisknockout.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/step-3.jpg?w=640&amp;h=627\" width=\"640\" height=\"627\" /></a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Glue it together:</strong>\u00a0Once you\u2019re all washi taped up, use the all purpose glue to sandwich the non-decorated sides together. The pegs will need to top-and-tail each other as shown, so you can wind your headphones round it properly.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://thisisknockout.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/step-4.jpg\"><img alt=\"step 4\" src=\"https://thisisknockout.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/step-4.jpg?w=640&amp;h=467\" width=\"640\" height=\"467\" /></a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>It\u2019s a wrap:</strong>\u00a0Woo hoo! You\u2019re pretty much there, you just need to add your headphones \u2013 et voila! Start by putting the jack plug into the end of one of the pegs, then wrapping the cable round and round your new creation.

character of Peter Rabbit. She was born in July of 1866 into a well off family. Back then, children were taught by a governess and Beatrix was no exception to the rule. Her love of watercolor led to her many drawings of her animals, insects, archaeological places, and fungi. Her drawings were so attentive to detail that her illustrations of fungi are still used today! She adored animals and had many different ones but favored her mice and rabbits. In all of her illustrations, notice that even though the mice have clothing on, they are still anatomically correct. When she began to lose her eyesight, she let her second love of farming move in front. She adored the country life and when she passed she left her\u2026</p>\n</div><p class=\"reblog-source\"><a href=\"http://literarycreature.wordpress.com/2013/07/15/the-tale-of-peter-rabbit-by-beatrix-potter/\">View original</a> <span class=\"more-words\">394 more words</span></p></div></div>", "post_id": 1515, "location": false, "date": "07-15-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["college of optometrists", "s rays", "age related macular degeneration", "postaday", "safety", "julbo sunglasses", "sunrays", "sun lotion", "coloured eyes"], "text": "<h1></h1>\n<p><a href=\"http://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/sunshine.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-866\" alt=\"sunshine\" src=\"https://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/sunshine.jpg?w=225&#038;h=225\" width=\"225\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Parents may leave their children at risk of developing cataracts in later life by exposing them to the sun&#8217;s rays without giving them appropriate eye protection, according to new research by the Royal College of Optometrists.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">The study found that 76 per cent of children do not wear sunglasses when out in the sun.

Wearing them should be part of the routine along with sun lotion, especially on the beach, where sand and water reflects UV rays up into the eyes. Make sure the glasses fit properly; not too tight or falling off, which defeats the point.

However, these figures are often a little shaky; some parks elect not to publish full attendance figures, and many parks are free to enter, but operate a pay-per-ride scheme &#8211; so I&#8217;ll factor some common sense in too.</strong></span></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>10. Lightwater Valley</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>The Ultimate is Lightwater Valley&#8217;s leading attraction.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Image \u00a9 Lightwater Valley</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>This last spot on the list was hard to pick; there are a number of theme parks in the UK which host some very good rides and attractions, such as Fantasy Island in Skegness, but I felt the Yorkshire\u2019s Lightwater Valley deserved it most. The park has struggled just to remain open in the past decade but it must be credited for its resilience and determination to continue to add new rides. The most famous, of course, is The Ultimate, a bizarre steel hybrid coaster that stretches across the park on a 7 minute, 7,442-feet-long trip (it is the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.themeparktourist.com/features/20111106/5223/top-10-longest-roller-coasters-world\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">second longest coaster on the planet</span></a>) through forests and over hills. More recently the park has focused on some stunning theming; the aging Rat Ride was rethemed to Raptor Attack in 2010, and has been met with rave reviews, and a new pirate area was installed in 2011.</strong></span></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>9. Paultons Park</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Cobra was the first step in a series of investments at Paultons Park.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Image \u00a9 Michael Miller</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Paultons Park is punching well above its historic weight in this list, but there is no doubt it deserves a place based on recent performance. Until 2006 the park was unheard of apart from those living nearby, but Paultons took the brave decision to invest in a major ride as it constructed Cobra, the UK&#8217;s first Gerstlauer Bobsled roller coaster. Rides of this type have been received very well over the world &#8211; they are not thrill rides by any means, but pack some pretty impressive speeds and forces into their small layouts. Cobra is no different and set a marker for the park.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>The next step came when\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.themeparktourist.com/features/20110418/3597/review-peppa-pig-world-paultons-park\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">Peppa Pig World</span></a>\u00a0was installed in 2011, featuring seven small rides and a number of other attractions based on the children\u2019s television show. Attendance has sky-rocketed during the past year and has let Paultons Park establish itself on a national basis.</strong></span></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>8. Oakwood Theme Park</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Oakwood&#8217;s natural beauty is only just eclipsed by the quality of its rides.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Image \u00a9 MGBS4</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Many people won\u2019t have heard of Oakwood simply because of its location: it\u2019s hidden away in the south west corner of Wales. This, unfortunatelym means that it garners only a fraction of the customers it should, and as a result the park has struggled at times. All the more the reason to visit!</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>The incredible wooden roller coaster Megafobia is the fundamental key to the park\u2019s success, being by far the most &#8220;airtime&#8221;-laden ride in the UK. Nearby, the huge Gerstlauer Eurofighter roller coaster Speed is one the biggest rides of its type in the world. Similarly, Drenched (formerly Hydro) stands out amongst all water rides considering its colossal 120 feet, near-vertical drop. Unlike many other parks in this list, Oakwood is a very pleasant place to be; the Welsh countryside is beautiful and the lack of marauding youths is always a plus.</strong></span></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>7. Drayton Manor</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Apocalypse is one of the best drop towers in the world. Image \u00a9 Matthew Wells</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Drayton Manor has the misfortune of being in the shadow of the nearby Alton Towers, athough this possibly helps rather than hinders its visitor numbers. In terms of roller coasters it should have a big advantage over Alton Towers in that there is no height limit imposed on it. However Shockwave, the stand up coaster, is rough and short, and G-Force, the high tech X-Car, is possibly the worst ride I have ever been on. But the bad points end there!</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Drayton Manor uses the height advantage fantastically with Apocalypse, the 180-feet-tall drop tower, which is no doubt one of the finest in the world. Maelstrom, a Frisbee style ride is also full of thrills, as is Storm Force 10, an incredibly well themed water ride with three powerful drops. However, the recent rise in popularity has not been down to the addition thrill rides, but as with Paultons Park, due to the addition of major children\u2019s attractions. Thomas Land (Thomas the Tank Engine, that is) was received very well in 2008 and last year\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.themeparktourist.com/features/20110425/3685/review-ben-10-ultimate-mission-rollercoaster-drayton-manor\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">Ben 10: Ultimate Mission</span></a>\u00a0was added too. It\u2019s one area in which it can realistically surpass Alton Towers, and so far it\u2019s doing it very well indeed.</strong></span></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>6. Chessington World of Adventures</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>The Vampire roller coaster interacts with impressive theming.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Image \u00a9 Kevin Geraghty-Shewen</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Chessington World of Adventures was once one of the biggest and most up-to-date theme parks in the country, but has since been eclipsed by the expansions of its sister parks, Thorpe Park and Alton Towers. However it remains a top quality theme park and recent additions show that it is really pushing to become a well-rounded attraction.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>The park aims to please families and younger children, and therefore doesn\u2019t have a great number of big thrill rides, but this is perfectly justified. Dragon\u2019s Fury, a fantastic Maurer spinner and Vampire, a classic Arrow suspended coaster still provide surprising thrills for their small statures. Chessington puts a big accent on nature; there is a fantastic zoo, the recently opened Wild Asia area of the park also holds a bird sanctuary, and plans have been revealed for a\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.themeparktourist.com/news/20120203/5929/images-safari-trail-ride-open-chessington-world-adventures-2013\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">Rhino Rally style safari ride for 2013</span></a>.</strong></span></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>5. Flamingo Land</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>The beautiful namesake animals make up a part of the stunning Flamingoland Zoo. Image \u00a9 Nick Fletcher</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Like certain other parks on this list, Flamingo Land is a late bloomer. In the nineties it was more of a large funfair, akin to Margate&#8217;s Dreamland or Blackpool Pleasure Beach, but of course without the coastal element. The rides were decent, but many of them only temporary. In 2002 a massive expansion began with the construction of Cliffhanger, the S&amp;S combo drop tower. Since then five roller coasters have been added, including a pair of Vekomas ; Velocity, a booster bike, and Kumali, a suspended looping coaster, and Mumbo Jumbo, an S&amp;S El Loco which briefly held the world record of steepest drop at an impressive 112 degrees. If recent rumours of a wooden roller coaster prove to be true we could certainly see an even greater rise for this Yorkshire park.</strong></span></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>4. Thorpe Park</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>The monstrous Swarm makes its debut this March at Thorpe Park.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Image \u00a9 Neil Zone</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Thorpe Park is on the rise. The level of commitment to investment from owner Merlin, has been unbelievable and unprecedented in the UK. It is now firmly established as one of the top 5 UK theme parks and has the potential to be even further up the list. With LEGOLAND Windsor and Chessington nearby, Merlin have focused the park solely on the teen and young adult market. This means the large-scale additions always hit the news and create a lot of interest. The latest installation,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.themeparktourist.com/features/20111002/4883/preview-swarm-thorpe-park-2012\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">The Swarm</span></a>, is set to open next month, and will become the UK&#8217;s first Bolliger &amp; Mabillard Wing Rider coaster. The Surrey theme park has regularly been condemned for its lack of attention to detail when it comes to theming, but if the plans and construction are anything to go by then The Swarm will certainly right this.</strong></span></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>3. LEGOLAND Windsor</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>A wonderful scene of London in LEGOLAND Windsor&#8217;s Miniland. Image \u00a9 Ashworth_Rich</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>LEGOLAND is an often-overlooked park, mainly because it doesn\u2019t attempt to cater to the adrenaline-junkies amongst us. Despite its very specific target market, the pre-teens, it still boasts visitor numbers heading towards 2 million. The LEGO brand continues to be a major draw, and rightly so. One of the most incredible parts of the park is the famous Miniland, a recreation of the most famous sights around the world made from nearly 40 million bricks. LEGOLAND Windsor also doesn\u2019t shy away from investment; you may not often hear of the additions it installs, but almost every year there will be a new attraction of some sort. The sheer number of shows, rides and attractions, as well as the recently built hotel, make LEGOLAND Windsor stand out.</strong></span></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>2. Alton Towers</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>There&#8217;s no doubt that the coasters are the biggest draw at Alton Towers. Image \u00a9 Phonnita Nakasint</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Alton Towers is a one-of-a-kind sort of place, and many would claim it deserves an even loftier finish on this list. The stats don\u2019t lie, however, but still the Staffordshire resort pulls in a hefty 2.5 million visitors a year. The main reason for its continuing popularity is simply the fact that it caters to everyone. It boasts the best collection of thrill coasters in the UK, as well as a variety of fun family rides and a plethora of smaller shows and attractions for the little ones.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>The primary reasons that Alton Towers doesn&#8217;t quite top this list are its out-of-the-way location and relatively high entry price. Personally, I believe the range of attractions justifies this, but you can see why many people would go elsewhere when you have to dish out up to \u00a342 per person just to get in through the gates (unless you&#8217;re using<a href=\"http://www.themeparktourist.com/special-offers\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">Theme Park Tourist&#8217;s Special Offer Watch</span></a>, of course).</strong></span></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>1. Blackpool Pleasure Beach</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Classic coasters such as Grand National add to the Pleasure Beach&#8217;s nostalgia. Image \u00a9 Matthew Wells</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Surprised? This historic amusement park has really dropped off the radar in recent years (or decades?) and been overshadowed by its Merlin-owned rivals. However, clearly it remains hugely popular with the British public due to its long history and being part of the entertainment and holiday district that is the Blackpool coast (charging only \u00a35 for entry doesn&#8217;t hurt, either). It certainly needs a lick of paint here and there, and aside from the relocated Infusion, a Vekoma suspended looping coaster, there have been few additions of note in the past 12 years.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>However, Blackpool Pleasure Beach still has one of the largest collections of coasters in the world, including a record 5 wooden coasters, and many cannot resist that nostalgic funfair, seaside atmosphere. The centrepiece attraction is The Big One, a colossal 213-feet-tall Arrow hypercoaster, which remains the UK\u2019s tallest ride 18 years after its debut. Many criticise the Pleasure Beach, and even more hope for a serious revival, but there\u2019s no doubt it\u2019ll be at near the top of the pile for years to come.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Which is your favourite \u00a0theme park?

Avoid beverages containing alcohol or caffeine.</span></strong></li>\n<li><strong><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">If possible, stay out of the sun and seek air-conditioned settings. The sun heats the inner core of your body, which may result in dehydration. If air-conditioning is not available, stay on the lowest floor, out of the sunshine, or go to a building with air conditioning (such as libraries, malls, supermarkets, or friends homes).</span></strong></li>\n<li><strong><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">If you must go outdoors, wear sunscreen with a high sun protector factor (SPF) rating of at least 15 and a hat to protect your face and head. When outdoors, wear loose-fitting, lightweight and light-colored clothing. Cover as much skin as possible to avoid sunburn and over-warming effects of sunlight on your body.</span></strong></li>\n<li><strong><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">Never leave children, pets or those who require special care in a parked car or other vehicles during periods of intense summer heat. Temperatures inside a closed vehicle can reach over 140 degrees Fahrenheit quickly.

Body temperature can rise and cause brain damage; death may result if the individual is not cooled quickly. Signals include hot, red, and dry skin; changes in consciousness; rapid, weak pulse, and shallow breathing. A cold bath or sponge can provide relief and lower body temperature.</span></strong></li>\n<li><strong><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">Heat Exhaustion:\u00a0While less dangerous than heat stroke, heat exhaustion poses health concerns and it most often occurs when people exercise too heavily or work in warm, humid places where body fluids are lost. Signals include cool, moist, pale or flushed skin; heavy sweating; headache; nausea or vomiting; dizziness and exhaustion. If symptoms occur, move the victim out of sun, and apply cool, wet cloths.</span></strong></li>\n<li><strong><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">Sunburn:\u00a0Sunburn slows the skin&#8217;s ability to cool itself. Signals include redness and pain; in severe cases, swelling of skin, blisters, fever, and headaches can occur. Ointments can be a relief for pain in mild cases. A physician should see serious cases. To protect yourself, wear sunscreen with a high sun protector factor rating (SPF) of at least 15. Always re-apply sunscreen after periods of heavy sweating or swimming.</span></strong></li>\n<li><strong><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">Heat Cramps:\u00a0Muscular pains and spasms are often caused by heavy exertion.

The birth of the new heir was announced by Kensington Palace after more than 14 hours of labor.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Cambridge was safely delivered of a son at 4.24 p.m.,&#8221; the palace said in a statement. &#8220;The baby weighs 8 lbs. 6 oz. The Duke of Cambridge was present for the birth.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;The queen, The Duke of Edinburgh, The Prince of Wales, The Duchess of Cornwall, Prince Harry and members of both families have been informed and are delighted with the news,&#8221; the statement said. &#8220;Her Royal Highness and her child are both doing well and will remain in hospital overnight.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The newborn is third in line to the British throne after its grandfather, Prince Charles, and father, Prince William. The reigning monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, has been on the throne 61 years. The baby is the queen&#8217;s third great-grandchild.</p>\n<p>The world&#8217;s intense interest in the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge&#8217;s real-life fairy tale extended to Middleton&#8217;s pregnancy and the baby long before it was born.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You have this gorgeous young couple,&#8221; ABC News royal contributor Victoria Murphy told ABCNews.com. &#8220;He&#8217;s a prince and she&#8217;s a commoner, and they get married and this is their first baby &#8212; so it&#8217;s like the completion of the fairy tale, and I think people find that really fascinating.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of fascination internationally in the British royal family just because it&#8217;s such an established institution and people find it quite quaint,&#8221; Murphy said. &#8220;People are just generally really curious about it because it&#8217;s not something that exists in every country.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Every moment leading up to the delivery has been closely scrutinized, including the royal bump, her pregnancy fashion and every baby-store shopping trip.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the fascination and joy everybody feels when a baby is born and then, for British people certainly, the renewal of the monarchy,&#8221; Robert Lacey, author of the book &#8220;Majesty,&#8221; told ABCNews.com.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We know that this new baby &#8230; is our sovereign who will be our figurehead by the end of this century, maybe even into the next century,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>The British Parliament is changing a 300-year-old law so that William and Kate&#8217;s firstborn, regardless of gender, would be the heir to the throne.</p>\n<p>Queen Elizabeth II was only person eligible to be monarch because her father had no male children.</p>\n<p>This birth marks the first time in almost 120 years that a reigning monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, 87, is alive at the same time as three generations of heirs: Prince Charles, 64, Prince William, 31, and, now, the latest addition to the family.</p>\n<p>The infant will someday be the monarch of 16 sovereign states and commander of the British Army, among having other royal responsibilities.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This new baby physically represents the mixture of history and new blood coming in, and the promise,&#8221; Lacey said.</p>\n<p>The roller coaster-like relationship between the public and the royal family is at a high point right now, thanks, in great part, to Middleton and her grounded nature, Lacey said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You have to strike a balance between the dignities and traditions of the family and the monarchy with something new, and she&#8217;s got that something new,&#8221; Lacey said. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s freshness, it&#8217;s energy, it&#8217;s directness, it&#8217;s honesty. It&#8217;s coming from a hardworking family which, to use an English expression, pulled itself up by its bootstraps.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The royal couple announced the pregnancy Dec. 3, 2012, when the duchess, 31, was admitted to King Edward VII Hospital in central London with hyperemesis gravidarum, an acute morning sickness that requires supplementary hydration and nutrients.</p>\n<p>Royal babies have typically been born within a year of marriage. Princess Diana gave birth to William 11 months after her wedding and the queen gave birth to Prince Charles six days before her first wedding anniversary.</p>\n<p>Prince William and Kate were married April 29, 2011.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think this is something they&#8217;ve had in their minds that they really wanted to do and they&#8217;re so excited that it&#8217;s happening,&#8221; Murphy said. &#8220;They&#8217;ve got friends who have kids, they&#8217;re at a really great age, they&#8217;ve been together for a long time, they&#8217;re still young enough to have lots of energy. I think both of them are just really, really excited about becoming parents.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It is widely expected that the new parents will strive for normalcy in their child&#8217;s life, much like the prince&#8217;s late mother, Princess Diana, instilled in her two sons, William and Harry. Diana famously made it a point of taking her boys beyond the palace walls for outings to the movies, amusement parks and McDonald&#8217;s.</p>\n<p>She also involved them in her charity work and famously took her young sons on a visit to a homeless shelter in 1996, the year before she died in a car accident. William is still involved with the shelter.</p>\n<p>&#8220;She played a huge part in my life and Harry&#8217;s growing up in how we saw things and how we experienced things,&#8221; Prince William told ABC News last year of his mother. &#8220;She very much wanted to get us to see the role in this of real life and I can&#8217;t thank her enough for that because reality bites in a big way and it was one of the biggest lessons I learned, is just how lucky and privileged how many of us are.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Such an attitude will likely influence the way William and Kate raise their new baby and future ruler.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The baby is going to be a different sort of leader of the country in that the whole essence of the royal family nowadays succeeds or fails on its ability to communicate with the rest of the population,&#8221; Lacey said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not looking for inspired, divine leadership. We&#8217;re looking for common sense and humanity,&#8221; Lacey said</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think that will be the priority for the parents, to give the child the most normal possible upbringing not only for its own good, but for the good of the job it&#8217;s got to do in the future. It&#8217;s got to have the common touch.&#8221;</p>\n</div>\n", "post_id": 1546, "location": false, "date": "07-22-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["style", "postaday", "newborn", "motherhood", "mental-health", "health", "home", "clothing"], "text": "<h1></h1>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>\n<p><strong><img alt=\"Top 10: Tips on coping with your newborn\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.blogcdn.com/www.parentdish.co.uk/media/2012/01/crying-newborn-baby-rex-1328038267.jpg\" /><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Rex Features</span></strong></p>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>I feel uncomfortable when assigned the tag of &#8220;expert&#8221; because I&#8217;ve had five children.

But I don&#8217;t want to get a reputation as an interfering old know-all in my real life.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Here, I have no such qualms so I have written out my top ten tips on coping, whether it&#8217;s your first or fourth. I shall, however, try to stop short of saying &#8220;in my day&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;.\u00a0</strong></span><br /><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>1. Ignorance can sometimes be bliss: I&#8217;m not talking about not knowing the signs of<a href=\"http://www.meningitis.org/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">meningitis</span></a>\u00a0or\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.preeclampsia.org/about.asp\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">preeclampsia</span></a>, of course. But I had no idea that having a c-section was supposed to make breastfeeding harder, for example. It wasn&#8217;t a walk in the park at first but I didn&#8217;t know any different and stuck at it. And, if you haven&#8217;t had your baby yet, don&#8217;t talk to women about their birth experiences.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>2. Have a<a href=\"http://www.thegreenparent.co.uk/articles/read/benefits-of-a-babymoon/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">\u00a0babymoon</span></a>:\u00a0Admittedly this was a new concept to me but one I wholeheartedly embraced with babies four and five. It&#8217;s hard to do but really important. You chill out in your PJs, preferably in bed at home, with your little one (and partner too, although he is on kitchen duty) for at least a week. And if you have other children they can join you, but once you&#8217;re dressed you&#8217;re back to full-on doing-it-all mode.\u00a0If there&#8217;s one thing you do from this list, let it be this one.\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>3. Embrace imperfection:\u00a0The laundry piling up, the dust settling, being in your nightclothes still at 4pm &#8212; all of that doesn&#8217;t matter. Things will get done. Just not right now and not as quickly as you&#8217;re used to. Exhale, let it go and snuggle with your baby. That&#8217;s all that matters.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>4. Accept help:\u00a0I know, this can also be tricky. People say &#8220;if you need any help let me know&#8221; which is a cop out because then you have to take the initiative. But take it you shall. Tell them you&#8217;d like nothing better if they could bake you one of their chocolate cakes/take your toddler out/cuddle the baby while you take a bath. They&#8217;ll be flattered to be asked and if they&#8217;re not, perhaps it might teach them not to make empty offers.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>5. Forget putting your baby in proper clothes:\u00a0I did this for the first few months (but maybe that&#8217;s because I&#8217;m lazy). Those teeny pairs of jeans look so cute but avoid at all costs. Babies need changing with alarming regularity and really, you don&#8217;t need to give yourself more work. Plus, I never thought proper clothes looked all that soft for little ones. Babies in white babygros with a knitted cardigan, on the other hand, look lovely.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>6. Go to National Childbirth Trust antenatal classes:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.nctpregnancyandbabycare.com/in-your-area\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">NCT classes</span></a>\u00a0are not populated by placenta eating, natural birthing hippies, at least not round my way. Mothers who join them seem to form such tight knit groups that trying to infiltrate is harder than joining the Freemasons. You will meet other mothers everywhere but having friends with babies very close in age, at least at first, is priceless. Avoid competitive mums though.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>7. Dismiss 99% of all advice:\u00a0Apart from this list, obviously. It is all very well people telling you to &#8220;leave the baby to cry&#8221; but it&#8217;s not them standing there with leaky breasts and tears streaming down their face. Do it your way (which could also mean leaving the baby to cry). You&#8217;re not a perfect mum (who is?) but you&#8217;re the perfect mum for your baby. Repeat it under your breath as a mantra.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>8. Don&#8217;t get your baby weighed too often:\u00a0I made this mistake at first. You feel so good when baby puts on nearly a pound (a pound!) in a week, especially if it&#8217;s thanks to your boobs. But a paediatrician advised me that monthly visits to the baby clinic are enough because you get too much &#8220;noise&#8221; on the chart otherwise (they will put on more weight some weeks than others, it&#8217;s the overall pattern that counts apparently). Obviously go if you have a question or concern but you know if your baby is thriving.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>9.\u00a0<a href=\"http://parentdish.co.uk/tag/Breastfeed/\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Breastfeed:</span></a>\u00a0Controversial, I realise, but I can&#8217;t ignore it. It was probably one of the best things I have ever done. It wasn&#8217;t easy. My nipples felt like they were trapped in a red hot vice for what felt like hours at first. Apart from all the well documented benefits, it means you have to slow down to baby&#8217;s pace. Don&#8217;t be afraid to use all the advice there is. With my fifth baby I had to enlist a breast feeding counsellor&#8217;s help. If you don&#8217;t want to do it, or can&#8217;t do it, that&#8217;s fine too. Your baby will still thrive.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>10. Enjoy it:\u00a0It&#8217;s corny but oh so true that this time really does go by so quickly. I don&#8217;t want any more children, but if I could have a superpower I&#8217;d choose to travel back in time to when mine were babies.

Photograph: Inspirestock Inc./Alamy</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff6600;\"><strong>Behaviour in the first few weeks of school can fix a child&#8217;s reputation among teachers, parents and classmates for years, according to research out today. A five-year-old labelled &#8220;naughty&#8221; after a handful of incidents could find it hard to be seen as &#8220;good&#8221;, no matter how they tried.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff6600;\"><strong>Inability to sit still, disrupting queues or failing to comply with requests, could result in a poor reputation, and teachers sometimes made assumptions based on a child&#8217;s family background, said the researchers.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff6600;\"><strong>&#8220;Reputations can start to solidify within the first term,&#8221; said Maggie MacLure, professor of education at Manchester Metropolitan University and co-author of the study, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council. &#8220;Teachers will have decided in a broad way what kind of child this is. Is it a good child? Things that contribute to reputation are often very public. A lot of what happens is in whole class settings \u2013 so if children are disciplined others see it happen.&#8221;</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff6600;\"><strong>The result, said MacLure, was that other children and their parents started to view the pupils in a similar way. She said teachers were well-intentioned but &#8220;the views form quickly in quite a nebulous way. If children go on to another class, their reputation could transfer with them just because one teacher writes a little note saying &#8216;This child has difficulty concentrating&#8217; or &#8216;This child won&#8217;t sit still&#8217;.&#8221;</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff6600;\"><strong>Siobhan Freegard, founder of the website Netmums, knows of many children who struggled to shake their reputation. &#8220;One little boy in my older son&#8217;s class found it really hard to sit still and control himself. Then, when they were 10, somebody snapped someone else&#8217;s pencil and all the children said he did it. Soon all the parents were talking about it, but it turned out he wasn&#8217;t even in the class at the time.&#8221; Another boy had earned the label of class clown and still could not shake it at 13.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff6600;\"><strong>Freegard said it was particularly tough for &#8220;summer babies&#8221; born in July and August. They can be a full year younger than others in class and significantly less mature, so are more likely to act up in the first term and earn a poor reputation.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff6600;\"><strong>Mick Brookes, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said the transition from home to school could be very difficult, and he had also seen pupils develop reputations. &#8220;It does happen. Someone is talking in assembly and you immediately look for Sean because it is usually him.&#8221; But forging a strong link with a child&#8217;s parents could turn pupils from being seen as &#8220;troublemakers to being contributors to the class&#8221;.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff6600;\"><strong>The study finds that adults have a notion of what a &#8220;proper&#8221; child should be, but learning to behave in a way appropriate for a classroom was tough for four- and five-year-olds. &#8220;Being good is not a simple matter,&#8221; it concludes. &#8220;Children need interpretative skills to decode and comply with requirements such as &#8216;sitting nicely&#8217;. They must be able to compete for teachers&#8217; attention and approval according to the rules and handle disappointment when they do not win\u2026 They must learn to perform the emotions and moral qualities valued in the reception class, and accept that other, less &#8216;appropriate&#8217;, emotions may not be equally recognised.&#8221;</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff6600;\"><strong>Some found it more difficult than others to be a &#8220;proper&#8221; child, and there was little tolerance for varying behaviour, partly because of the pressure to ensure pupils performed academically.</strong></span></p>\n", "post_id": 1555, "location": false, "date": "07-23-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<div class=\"wpcom-reblog-snapshot\"> <div class=\"reblog-post\"><p class=\"reblog-from\"><img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/f9aee2c8b846d10d214c7e97f0e1945b?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />Originally posted on <a href=\"http://ecofriendlysolutions.wordpress.com/2013/07/23/recycle-a-handbook-for-kids/\">Eco Friendly Experts</a>:</p><div class=\"reblogged-content\">\n<p>This lively and informative handbook explains the process of recycling from start to finish.

Diet has a direct relation to the strength and beauty of teeth. Malnutrition is the main cause for weak teeth and junk food is the largest culprit in tooth decay.</p>\n\n<p>A consistent supply of vitamins, minerals and other essential nutrients keeps the teeth safe from damage and make them strong enough for your kid to enjoy sweets without worry.</p>\n\n<p>Of course all healthy foods are natural. Fruits and vegetables are the most important source of nutrients. Vitamin C is a very important component of dental health. It helps strengthen gums and boosts up resistance. Fruits like kiwis, oranges and strawberries are a great source of Vitamin C. The fruits will prevent harmful bacteria from colonizing and contributing in gingivitis.</p>\n\n<p>Article from Dentistry.net.\u00a0See more\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dentistry.net/pediatric-dentistry/kids-teeth-foods-to-enhance-and-strengthen-teeth/\">here</a>.</p>\n</div><p class=\"reblog-source\"><a href=\"http://regencydentalofstuart.wordpress.com/2013/07/23/kids-teeth-foods-to-enhance-and-strengthen-teeth/\">View original</a></p></div></div>", "post_id": 1561, "location": false, "date": "07-23-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<div class=\"wpcom-reblog-snapshot\"> <div class=\"reblog-post\"><p class=\"reblog-from\"><img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/7f16cca333a89891094dc47ef7605192?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />Originally posted on <a href=\"http://thejasongreene.com/2013/07/23/things-that-go-by-emily-snead-book-review/\">OneGoodDad</a>:</p><div class=\"reblogged-content\">\n<p><b><a href=\"http://thejasongreene.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/things-that-go.gif\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1003 alignleft\" src=\"http://thejasongreene.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/things-that-go.gif?w=250&#038;h=292\" height=\"292\" width=\"250\" alt=\"Things that Go\"></a><a href=\"http://barronseduc.stores.yahoo.net/1438003242.html\">Things That Go!</a></b></p>\n\n<p><b>Author: Emily Stead</b></p>\n\n<p><b>Illustrators: Anna Stiles, Lucy Neale, and Dan Crisp</b></p>\n\n<p><b>Publisher: <a href=\"http://barronseduc.com/\">Barron\u2019s</a></b></p>\n\n<p><b>Price: $9.99</b></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://barronseduc.stores.yahoo.net/1438003242.html\">Things That Go!</a> is an activity book that would be a great addition to any children\u2019s library.

Louis is also a favourite and was the name of Lord Mountbatten, the uncle of the Duke of Edinburgh.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">The announcement comes a day after the duchess left hospital and two days after she gave birth, and hours after the Queen met her great-grandson for the first time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">George was the most popular name with betting firms William Hill, Coral and\u00a0<a id=\"_GPLITA_0\" title=\"Click to Continue &gt; by Discount Buddy\" href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk-news/2013/jul/24/prince-george-alexander-louis-royal-baby#\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">Paddy Power</span></a>. James was also a favourite with punters, with Alexander, Henry, Louis, Richard and Arthur the next most popular choices.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">It was widely expected that William and Kate would not wander far from convention and select anything too outlandish for a prince who is likely to reign one day and whose name could symbolise an era.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">The naming has happened quickly by historical royal standards. Prince George&#8217;s father was not named for a week, and it took a month for the name of the baby&#8217;s paternal grandfather, Prince Charles, to be announced.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">Earlier, for the first time in more than a century, a reigning monarch met a great-grandchild born in direct succession to the crown when the Queen was introduced to Prince George.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">She made the short journey from Buckingham Palace to Kensington Palace, where the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their son had spent their first night at home as a new family.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">Not since the birth in 1894 of the eldest son of the future George V and Queen Mary \u2013 the future Edward VIII, who later abdicated \u2013 in\u00a0<a id=\"FALINK_2_0_1\" href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk-news/2013/jul/24/prince-george-alexander-louis-royal-baby#\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">the twilight</span></a>of Queen Victoria&#8217;s reign has such an encounter occurred. Though Wednesday&#8217;s meeting lasted just 30 minutes \u2013 before the start of the Queen&#8217;s traditional summer break at Balmoral on Friday \u2013 it adds another footnote to royal history.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">Arriving in a dark green Bentley, the 87-year-old monarch was alone: the Duke of Edinburgh was at Windsor, where he is still convalescing following exploratory abdominal surgery last month. She had previously said she was thrilled with the safe delivery of her first great-grandson, who was born at 4.24pm on Monday weighing 8lb 6oz in the private Lindo wing at St Mary&#8217;s hospital at Paddington in west London.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">Among other visitors received by the Cambridges was Prince Harry, the baby&#8217;s uncle, who is now bumped down to fourth in the line of succession. He has previously said: &#8220;I can&#8217;t wait to be an uncle.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">The duchess&#8217;s sister, Pippa Middleton, visited on Tuesday night shortly after mother and baby were discharged from hospital.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">After presenting their newborn to the world in a photocall on the hospital steps on Tuesday, William and Kate will now seek some privacy.

Those hard-earned hours of relaxation will be quickly undone if you have to start filing a claim on your home insurance.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>To that end, here&#8217;s five ways to protect your home before you go on your summer holiday, so you can enjoy &#8216;no more worries for a week or two&#8217;.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>1. Hide the tell-tale signs you&#8217;re away</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Nothing says &#8216;I&#8217;m an empty house, break in and help yourself&#8217; like a pile of letters visibly building up on the doormat, leaflets dangling out of the letterbox or bottles of milk lining up outside your front door. Consider giving a trusted neighbour a spare key so that they can pick up the mail every couple of days.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Alternatively, the Royal Mail&#8217;s Keepsafe service will hold your mail for up to two months. If you&#8217;re only going away for a fortnight, Keepsafe will hold your mail for up to 17 days for \u00a311.25.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Cancelling the milk delivery and any other grocery deliveries will also keep your home safer and save you a bit of money too.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>2. Turn everything off at the socket</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Make sure that every single appliance except for your faithful fridge/freezer is turned off at the wall and not left on stand-by. Not only does this reduce the risk of fires, it&#8217;ll also save you money on your utility bills.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>While you&#8217;re at it, check your central heating, if you have it. There&#8217;s not going to be any frost for a few months yet, so you could turn off any automatic time-sets and avoid heating an empty house.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Also check you&#8217;ve not left any fires or free-standing heaters on. And double-check the oven: a colleague cooked some pasta for his daughter before setting off on hols last year and spent the whole of his break worrying about whether he&#8217;d switched off the gas ring or not.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>3. Create the impression you&#8217;re still home</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Remember in the film Home Alone when Kevin McAllister duped hapless burglars Harry and Marv into thinking that the house was occupied and actually hosting a party?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Well, you don&#8217;t need to go that far, but you can buy timing switches for your lights which can be set to turn on and off at specific times of the day, giving the impression you&#8217;re home.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>If you&#8217;re driving to the airport or your resort, see if you can find someone to park their car outside your house while you&#8217;re away.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>4. Locks and keys</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>It sounds fairly obvious, but make sure you do a sweep to ensure all doors and windows are closed and locked properly. Check the garage and shed as well, if you have them.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>If you were to leave a door or window unsecured and were burgled, you may find your home insurance provider unwilling to pay out for a claim because you failed to take &#8220;reasonable care&#8221; of the property.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Also, once the doors and windows are locked, make sure the keys are completely out of sight and reach of any windows or your letterbox. There&#8217;s no point locking a door if you&#8217;re putting the key within easy reach of an intruder.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Finally, leave a spare set of keys with a friend, relative or trusted neighbour so that someone can gain entry to the property if something was to go wrong inside the house.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>According to NFU Mutual research, you&#8217;re statistically more likely to be a victim of water damage from a leaking or burst pipe than you are to be burgled &#8211; so having someone check on the property while you&#8217;re away could prevent disaster.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>5. Don&#8217;t broadcast your absence</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Many of us like to brag about where we&#8217;re jetting off to on Facebook, or even post pictures from the beach on Twitter &#8211; but this could be a big mistake.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>MoneySupermarket&#8217;s home insurance expert Hannah Skenfield warns: &#8220;In the excitement of your trip it is all too easy to publicise that your home is empty. Avoid posting your trip on your social media account, where it may be viewed by strangers, until you get back.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>&#8220;Just taking some simple precautions will significantly reduce the likelihood of needing to make an insurance claim and help ensure that your lasting summer memories are of your holiday and not of a problem that occurred at home.&#8221;</strong></span></p>\n", "post_id": 1575, "location": false, "date": "07-26-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["transportation", "llaboutmanners", "cars", "spill proof", "hot beverages", "toilet lid"], "text": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/keep-kids-safe.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1580\" alt=\"keep-kids-safe\" src=\"https://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/keep-kids-safe.jpg?w=331&#038;h=319\" width=\"331\" height=\"319\" /></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">1. Kid Safety in the Kitchen</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Toddlers gravitate to the kitchen; after all, that&#8217;s where families spend much of their time. Cook on the back burners and turn pot handles away so they aren&#8217;t in reach. Drink hot beverages out of spill-proof and unbreakable travel mugs to avoid burns. Never leave dangling cords; unplug items when not in use and store, and those that are used, keep cords wraped tightly with a twist tie. Store cleaning fluids in locked cabinet out of sight and temptation. Don&#8217;t allow access into pantry.</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">2. Kid Safety in the Bathroom</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">For safety and to avoid expensive plumber calls, keep the toilet lid down and locked when not in use. It&#8217;s a good idea to limit access to the bathroom with a safety gate or lock, if practical. There is too much temptation. Never leave medications around; keep locked and out of reach. Also keep items like mouthwash, toothpaste and other kid hazard items away. Plungers can make a fun (if not disgusting) play toy to a toddler; don&#8217;t leave one by the toilet. Always drain the bathtub.</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">3. Kid Safety in the Family Room</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">With kids, when is there ever not things on the floor? Be on constant guard for small toys and objects that can be choking hazards, batteries, coins, marbles, and pieces of toys from older siblings (wheels, doll shoes, etc.) Keep elecrical cords out of reach and use outlet covers. Child-proof window treatment cords. Secure televisions and other electronic equipment to avoid any potential for tipping over on a child. Use safety gates on stairs. Remove temptations from tabletops.</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">4. Kid Safety in the Bedroom</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Lamps, flowing curtains or drapes, area rugs, and even candles are items that add to the ambiance of a master bedroom but could prove to be a danger zone for young children. Cutesy table lamps and rocking chairs that were so precious in an infant&#8217;s room can now spell disaster if a toddler starts standing in the chair or can reach for the lamp and remove it from its stand. Be sure pictures are mounted solidly on the walls and that bookcases are also affixed to the walls, if possible.</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">5. Kid Safety in the Yard</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Be sure to limit access to outside with locks out of reach of a curious tot. Backyard swing sets and play areas are wonderful, but make sure they are safe by having a soft surface underneath. If your yard is fenced, be sure that is locked as well. Always enclose pools, ponds or hot tubs and put a safety fence between any water source and the house. Keep kiddie pools drained when not in use. Keep power tools and garden equipment safe and out of reach; the same holds true for insecticides.</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">6. Kid Safety in the Car</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Be sure you have your child&#8217;s car seat installed correctly and in accordance with safety regulations. Utilize a booster seat for as long as child needs one for height and weight factors (which may be longer than your child wants). Be sure that kids cannot open a door or window from their seat (utilize child locks, as needed). The sun shades help with comfort for toddlers on car trips. Set safety practices with the opening/shutting of car doors to avoid smashed finger injuries.</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">7. Kid Safety at Others&#8217; Homes</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Your house may be toddler proof, but neighbors and relatives may not have the need. That means parents must be on particular guard when visiting others&#8217; homes for safety. Medicine cabinets, drawers, and other &#8220;unsafe&#8221; areas may be a temptation to toddlers, and it only takes a moment to get into danger. If possible, bring entertainment for your toddler and designate a single &#8220;safe room&#8221; for your youngster to stay in. And, always accompany your toddler to the bathroom (even if potty-trained).</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">8. Kid Safety Out and About</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Parents greatest safety fears can sometimes be when walking with youngsters to and from stores, among parked cars, and in crowded situations&#8211;and with good reason. Toddlers are prone to darting around and insistent on walking independently. Kids should be told rules of hand-holding and other safety measures, and parents should enforce those rules at all costs. In crowded stores, consider tying a balloon on a wrist so you can see your youngster in case of an accidental separation.</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">9. Kid Safety and Toys</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Require that your youngster wear a bike helmet and other safety gear. Create/buy a safety flag on a bike, big wheel or other toy when used outdoors so you can distinguish your child and his location at a glance. Carefully consider toys like trampolines, spinning toys, scooters, bouncing balls, in-line skates, and other popular items that can be fun but also potentially dangerous. If you do buy such an item, be sure to follow safety recommendations and supervise your child&#8217;s use closely.</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">10. Kid Safety and Sports</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">More and more parents are placing their toddler-aged children into sports for exercise and to learn fundamentals of soccer, gymnastics, baseball, basketball, and cheer. Age-appropriate programs can be a great outlet for a youngster&#8217;s energy and provide exercise and coordination activities as well. But, beware of programs that don&#8217;t take a young child&#8217;s limitations into account, or else injuries can occur.</span></p>\n", "post_id": 1579, "location": false, "date": "07-27-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "", "post_id": 1582, "location": false, "date": "07-27-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<div class=\"wpcom-reblog-snapshot\"> <div class=\"reblog-post\"><p class=\"reblog-from\"><img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/13262ae81427259d45bb4de1ba9014ba?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />Originally posted on <a href=\"http://apoetryjourney.wordpress.com/2013/07/27/haiku-gotham-nights/\">Books, Movies, Poetry</a>:</p><div class=\"reblogged-content\">\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">I guard the darkness</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">While the city sleeps below</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Safely in slumber</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://game-insider.com/tag/batman/\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-10837 aligncenter\" src=\"http://apoetryjourney.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/batman.jpg?w=808&#038;h=606\" height=\"606\" width=\"808\" alt=\"batman\"></a></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"></p>\n</div><p class=\"reblog-source\"><a href=\"http://apoetryjourney.wordpress.com/2013/07/27/haiku-gotham-nights/\">View original</a></p></div></div>", "post_id": 1583, "location": false, "date": "07-27-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<div class=\"wpcom-reblog-snapshot\"> <div class=\"reblog-post\"><p class=\"reblog-from\"><img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/455f096a9a377940c4b0dd9607ce5e8e?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />Originally posted on <a href=\"http://alaksblog.wordpress.com/2013/07/27/childrens-secrets-dos-and-donts/\">All About Kids &amp; Parenting</a>:</p><div class=\"reblogged-content\">\n<p><em><a href=\"http://alaksblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/whisper.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-796 alignleft\" src=\"http://alaksblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/whisper.jpg?w=220&#038;h=179\" height=\"179\" width=\"220\" alt=\"whisper\"></a>Too often, child abuse continues because kids are coerced into keeping problems a secret.

Avoid scary stories or TV shows. It&#8217;s better to read a favorite book every night than a new one because it&#8217;s familiar.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><b>5.</b>\u00a0Avoid singing or rocking your child to sleep, because if she wakes in the middle of the night she may need you to sing or rock her back to sleep &#8212; a condition known as sleep-onset association disorder. (If you have already been doing this, try to phase this behavior out gradually.) Instead, have her get used to falling asleep with a transitional object, like a favorite blanket or stuffed animal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><b>6.</b>\u00a0Make sure your child is comfortable. Clothes and blankets should not restrict movement, and the bedroom temperature shouldn&#8217;t be too warm or too cold.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><b>7.</b>\u00a0If your child calls for you after you&#8217;ve left his room, wait a few moments before responding. This will remind him that he should be asleep, and it&#8217;ll give him the chance to soothe himself and even fall back asleep while he is waiting for you.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><b>8.</b>\u00a0If your child comes out of her room after you&#8217;ve put her to bed, walk her back and gently but firmly remind her that it&#8217;s bedtime.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><b>9.</b>\u00a0Give your child tools to overcome his worries.

While healthy and realistic expectations can encourage kids\u2019 success, unrealistically high expectations can set children up for failure. Such unrealistic expectations can also lead to anxiety and discouragement when a child cannot live up to her parents\u2019 goals. Likewise, low expectations can make it difficult for kids to see and achieve their full potential.</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n<div id=\"section-1\">\n<h2><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Perpetuating Family Patterns</strong></span></h2>\n<div id=\"section-2\">\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Unrealistic parental expectations often stem from parents\u2019 own upbringings. Mimi Hudson, M.A., R.C.C. of North Shore Family Services, explains that parents often try to compensate for their own unmet childhood needs by setting expectations for their children, based on their own experiences rather than on their child\u2019s needs. For example, parents who were disappointed with their own academic performance might emphasize high academic achievement in their own children. Overall, parents must be aware of their children\u2019s unique needs and strengths, as well as to exercise self-awareness when establishing expectations.</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"section-3\">\n<h2><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Self-Concept</strong></span></h2>\n<div id=\"section-4\">\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Parents\u2019 expectations for their children can affect the way that kids perceive their own abilities and potential. For instance, if parents have different expectations for how girls and boys behave, children will often internalize these behavioral expectations. While these parental beliefs can be positive in some cases, they also have the potential to negatively influence a child\u2019s perception of herself, particularly if the parents\u2019 wishes are not congruent with the child\u2019s.</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"section-5\">\n<h2><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Self-Discipline</strong></span></h2>\n<div id=\"section-6\">\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Parental expectations are a cornerstone of discipline in kids. When paired with loving, supportive attitudes, setting clear behavioral and academic expectations for children can help them learn manners, social skills, study skills and other tools they will need to succeed in school and in society. However, for expectations to lead to positive behaviors, parental rules and ideas about proper behavior must be age-appropriate and consider the child\u2019s maturity level and skills. If rules are expectations far exceed a child\u2019s abilities, this may create anxiety or insubordinate behaviors. Thus, parents should consider each child\u2019s unique skills and limitations when establishing expectations.</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"section-7\">\n<h2><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Academic Success</strong></span></h2>\n<div id=\"section-8\">\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Parental expectations can have a strong, positive effect on children\u2019s academic success. In a study conducted published by the Harvard Family Research project, Professor William H. Jeynes of California State University at Long Beach found that parental expectations affected children\u2019s academic outcomes more than other types of parental involvement, including attendance of school events and clear rules. Thus, establishing healthy academic expectations and communicating these expectations to kids can be an important key to fostering success in school.</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</article>\n", "post_id": 1598, "location": false, "date": "07-30-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["sister", "shoes", "cow", "field", "brother", "phone", "shoelaces"], "text": "<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='420' height='315' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/mLp1boBKHBQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span>\n", "post_id": 16, "location": false, "date": "12-06-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<div class=\"wpcom-reblog-snapshot\"> <div class=\"reblog-post\"><p class=\"reblog-from\"><img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/198fc5fa3ba94e164e17645d0c2275ee?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />Originally posted on <a href=\"http://growingupadhd.wordpress.com/2013/07/30/battle-of-the-bedroom/\">Growing up ADHD</a>:</p><div class=\"reblogged-content\">\n<p>As we all know most kids don\u2019t like to clean their rooms and we the parents have to pick our battles.

Going to a strange place with strange people and being separated from parents and familiar faces can be a terrifying thing for anyone to go through, especially for a child of 4 or 5. It is up to us as parents to prepare our children for that big day, even though we may be feeling just as scared and even a little sad ourselves. Here are some things that you can do to get your child and yourself ready for that first day of school.<br />\nRead Stories About Starting School- If you have a normal story reading routine with your child (or even if you don&#8217;t), you can start reading them books about the first day of school. Kids will often relate with the child in the story and the outcome of the book may put them more at ease about their own first day. Some great books to consider are Franklin Goes To School by Paulette Bourgeois and Brenda Clark and The Night Before Kindergarten by Natasha Wing.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Teach Them The Basics- Before your child begins school he or she should know or should be actively practicing some basic things. These things include being able to spell and write their first and last name. They should also be able to count to 10 and tie their shoes. You should also probably start practicing their address and phone number with them as well. These will probably be difficult for them to learn at first, but if you keep practicing on a regular basis, like reciting it a few times while getting ready for bed, they will eventually commit it to memory.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Attend School Orientation With Your Child- Whenever a child is attending school for the first time, whether it&#8217;s Kindergarten or Pre-K, an orientation will usually be offered. This orientation will offer a variety of useful things, such as the ability to ask and have addressed any questions and concerns you may have, the opportunity for you and your child to meet the teachers, principal and bus drivers, as well as the opportunity for your child to take a tour of the classroom and the rest of the school. Depending on the school and whether or not your child will be taking the bus, your child may also be able to take a mini bus ride around the parking lot to see what it&#8217;s like to ride on a bus. Plus, your child may get to meet some of the children that they will be attending class and possibly making friends with. All of these things can help your child prepare for and even anticipate the first day of school, so be sure not to miss this important event.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Include Them in the School Shopping- Allow your child to go shopping with you for their new clothes and school supplies, and be sure to let them pick certain things out for themselves, such as their book bag, folders and their first day of school outfit. After you&#8217;re done shopping, let them help you organize and pack all of the things they will need to take with them on the first day. This will make them feel like they have more control over a situation that seems to be out of their control, and they&#8217;ll probably feel more relaxed and excited as well.</span></p>\n", "post_id": 1627, "location": false, "date": "08-04-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["spoon", "toddler", "Table manners", "misbehave"], "text": "<h1 id=\"articleTitle\" style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/manners-monkek.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-164\" title=\"manners monkek\" src=\"https://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/manners-monkek.jpg?w=224&#038;h=225\" alt=\"\" width=\"224\" height=\"225\" /></a></h1>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><a href=\"http://www.babycenter.com/0_teaching-table-manners-to-your-toddler_1429019.bc#articlesection1\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">Can I really expect my toddler to learn good table manners?</span></a></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><a href=\"http://www.babycenter.com/0_teaching-table-manners-to-your-toddler_1429019.bc#articlesection2\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">What can I teach him?</span></a></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><a href=\"http://www.babycenter.com/0_teaching-table-manners-to-your-toddler_1429019.bc#articlesection3\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">What&#8217;s the best way to tackle these lessons?</span></a></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><a href=\"http://www.babycenter.com/0_teaching-table-manners-to-your-toddler_1429019.bc#articlesection4\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">What should I do when my toddler misbehaves at the table?</span></a></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><a href=\"http://www.babycenter.com/0_teaching-table-manners-to-your-toddler_1429019.bc?page=2#articlesection5\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">What are some good rules at this point?</span></a></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><a href=\"http://www.babycenter.com/0_teaching-table-manners-to-your-toddler_1429019.bc?page=2#articlesection6\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">How can I get my toddler to behave in restaurants?</span></a></span></li>\n</ul>\n<div><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">\u00a0Can I really expect my toddler to learn good table manners?</span></div>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">It may seem like a long shot, as you watch him purposely drop his spoon on the floor and gleefully fingerpaint with his mashed potatoes. But with a big serving of patience, you can start instilling the idea that there are acceptable and unacceptable ways to act at the table. Manners are built over time, and you can start teaching your child some concepts just as soon as he can sit in a highchair.What can I teach him?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">Of course, you won&#8217;t be showing your toddler which fork to use for dessert, or how to gracefully dip his soup spoon. But you can teach him that mealtime is a pleasant experience for the family. You can help him wash his hands before coming to the table, and you can start teaching him not to bang or throw utensils, not to throw food or grab it from other people&#8217;s plates, and not to spit, scream, or run around the table while others are eating. And just as soon as your child can talk, he can learn to say &#8220;please&#8221; and &#8220;thank you.&#8221;What&#8217;s the best way to tackle these lessons?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">Your toddler wants to please you, and he wants to be like you, so the best way is to show him how it&#8217;s done. Talk pleasantly at the table \u2013 no lectures, arguments, or raised voices. Say &#8220;please&#8221; and &#8220;thank you&#8221; when you ask for something to be passed. And don&#8217;t read your tablet, text, watch television, talk on the phone, or jump up to tend to other things.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">Consistency will help make good manners a habit for your child in the coming years, so when you introduce a behavior, set expectations and use gentle reminders to reinforce them. Once your child learns to say &#8220;please,&#8221; prompt him to say it before you give him that second helping, for example.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">Give your child strokes for behaving well at the table \u2013 when he sits quietly, uses his spoon, and says &#8220;thank you.&#8221; Don&#8217;t overdo the praise, though, because you don&#8217;t want him to think that he&#8217;s the center of attention whenever you sit down to share a meal.</span></p>\n<div><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">\u00a0What should I do when my toddler misbehaves at the table?</span></div>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">You have a couple of choices. Some parents find it&#8217;s best to ignore the misbehavior \u2013 the spitting, the screaming, the mess-making. When this tactic works, it&#8217;s because the child stops doing whatever gets no response.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">Other parents find that it&#8217;s better to find ways to discourage their child&#8217;s problematic behavior. One mom discovered that if she wiped her toddler&#8217;s face every time he spit out his food, he&#8217;d stop spitting. Other times just a reminder, like placing the spoon in your toddler&#8217;s hand when he grabs a fistful of food, is all that&#8217;s needed. And some parents simply remove their toddlers from the table when they do things that are unacceptable, explaining that their behavior is not good manners.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">If you make it enjoyable for your toddler to share meals with you \u2013 by talking with him and being upbeat \u2013- then he&#8217;s more likely to want to stay and share the good vibes. Next time (or eventually, in any case), he won&#8217;t do things that get him banished.</span></p>\n", "post_id": 163, "location": false, "date": "08-02-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<div class=\"wpcom-reblog-snapshot\"> <div class=\"reblog-post\"><p class=\"reblog-from\"><img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/fe9b78c069be17cd4a7ffb214fa8a071?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />Originally posted on <a href=\"http://mommyanddaddyspage.wordpress.com/2013/08/04/being-a-positive-parent-the-top-10-questions-to-ask-yourself/\">Mommy &amp; Daddy&#039;s Blog</a>:</p><div class=\"reblogged-content\">\n<p><b>1.

After having over fifty parents answer this question, I have found the most common answer to be anywhere from a five or less. As parents, we tend to think we are never doing enough. We think we\u2019re ok but could always do better. We remember everything we did wrong.

The concept of cyber-bull where I\u2019m from is more or less an oxymoron (ain\u2019t no body got time for that!). From as early as nine or ten years old most kids (myself included) experience physical bullying in the form of belting and a range of corporal punishments I cannot begin to explain. The school systems are structured to permit this kind of treatment with an unspoken rule that arranges a power structure within students based on what year you are in. Teachers of course are allowed to smack you.

Bullying prevention skills can protect kids from most bullying, increase their confidence, and help them to develop positive peer relationships. Here are some practices you can work on with the young people in your life now.</strong></span></p>\n<div>\n<h4><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>1. Walking with Awareness, Calm, Respect, and Confidence</strong></span></h4>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>People are less likely to be picked on if they walk and sit with awareness, calm, respect, and confidence. Projecting a positive, assertive attitude means keeping one\u2019s head up, back straight, walking briskly, looking around, having a peaceful face and body, and moving away from people who might cause trouble.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Show your child the difference between being passive, aggressive, and assertive in body language, tone of voice and choice of words. Have your child walk across the floor, coaching her or him to be successful, by saying for example; \u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201d \u201cNow take bigger steps\u201d, \u201cLook around you\u201d \u201cStraighten your back.\u201d etc.</strong></span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>2. Leaving in a Powerful, Positive Way</strong></span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>The best self-defense tactic is called \u201ctarget denial,\u201d which means \u201cdon\u2019t be there.\u201d Act out a scenario where maybe your child is walking in the school corridor (or any other place where he or she might bullied). You can pretend to be a bully standing by the wall saying mean things. Ask your child what these mean things might be because what is considered insulting or upsetting is different for different people, times, and places.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Coach your child to veer around the bully in order to move out of reach. Remind your child to leave with awareness, calm and confidence, glancing back to see where the bully is. Let your child practicing saying something neutral in a normal tone of voice like \u201cSee you later!\u201d or \u201cHave a nice day!\u201d while calmly and confidently moving away. Point out that stepping out of line or changing seats is often the safest choice.</strong></span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>3. Setting a Boundary</strong></span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>If a bully is following or threatening your child in a situation where she or he cannot just leave, your child needs to be able to set a clear boundary.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Pretend to poke your child in\u00a0<a id=\"_GPLITA_0\" title=\"Click to Continue &gt; by Text-Enhance\" href=\"http://www.kidpower.org/library/article/prevent-bullying/?gclid=CMTi97GA87gCFWXKtAodoygAQA#\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">the back</span></a>\u00a0(do this very gently; the idea is not to be hurtful). Coach your child to turn, stand up tall, put his or her hands up in front of the body like a fence, palms out and open, and say \u201cStop!\u201d.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Coach your child to have a calm but clear voice and polite firm words- not whiney and not aggressive. Show how to do it and praise your child for trying -even though she or he does not get it right to begin with. Realize that this might be very hard and triggering for your child (and maybe for you too).</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Children need support to learn these skills. The idea is that your child takes charge of his or her space by moving away and, if need be, setting boundaries as soon as a problem is about to start \u2013 so that your child doesn\u2019t wait until the bullying is already happening.</strong></span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>4. Using Your Voice</strong></span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>If your child does get into a situation where somebody is trying to push or hit or knuckle her or his head, you could practice by holding your child gently and acting as if you are going to do the action gently. Coach your child to pull away and yell NO! really loudly. Coach him or her to say \u201cSTOP! I don\u2019t like that!\u201d Coach your child to look the bully in the eyes and speak in a firm voice with both hands up and in front like a fence. Teach your child to leave and go to an adult for help.</strong></span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>5. Protecting Your Feelings From Name-Calling</strong></span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Schools, youth groups, and families should create harassment-free zones just as workplaces should. However, you can teach children how to protect themselves from insults. Tell your child that saying something mean back makes the problem bigger, not better.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>One way to take the power out of hurting words by is saying them out loud and imagining throwing them away. Doing this physically and out loud at home will help a child to do this in his or her imagination at school.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Help your child practice throwing the mean things that other people are saying into a trash can. Have your child then say something positive out loud to himself or herself to take in. For example, if someone says, \u201cI don\u2019t like you, \u201d you can throw those words away and say, \u201cI like myself.\u201d If someone says, \u201cYou are stupid\u201d you can throw those words away and say, \u201cI\u2019m smart.\u201d If someone says, \u201cI don\u2019t want to play with you\u201d then you can throw those words away and say, \u201cI will find another friend.\u201d</strong></span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>6. Speaking Up for Inclusion</strong></span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Being left out is a major form of bullying. Exclusion should be clearly against the rules at school. A child can practice persisting in asking to join a game.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Pretend to be a bully who wants to exclude.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Have your child walk up and say, \u201cI want to play.\u201d Coach your child to sound and look positive and friendly, not whiny or aggressive.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Ask your child the reasons that kids give for excluding him or her. Use those reasons so your child can practice persisting. For example, if the reason is, \u201cYou\u2019re not good enough,\u201d your child can practice saying \u201cI\u2019ll get better if I practice!\u201d If the reason is, \u201cThere are too many already,\u201d your child might practice saying, \u201cThere\u2019s always room for one more.\u201d If the reason is, \u201cYou cheated last time,\u201d your child might practice saying, \u201cI did not understand the rules. Let\u2019s make sure we agree on the rules this time.\u201d</strong></span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>7. Being Persistent in Getting Help</strong></span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Children who are being bullied need to be able to tell teachers, parents, and other adults in charge what is happening in the moment clearly and calmly and persistently even if these adults are very distracted or rude \u2013 and even if asking for help has not worked before. Learning how to have polite firm words, body language and tone of voice even under pressure and to not give up when asking for help is a life-long skill.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>We have found that practice is helpful for both children and adults in learning how to persist and get help when you need it. Here is one you can do with your child.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Pretend to be a teacher or someone else who your child might expect help and support from. Tell your child who you are pretending to be and where you might be at school. Have your child start saying in a clear calm voice, \u201cExcuse me I have a safety problem.\u201d</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>You pretend to be busy and just ignore your child! Coach him or her to keep going and say: \u201cExcuse me, I really need your help.\u201d</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Act irritated and impatient and say, \u201cYes. what is it now?\u201d and keep being busy.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Coach your child to say something specific like, \u201cThe girls over there are calling me names and not letting me play with them. I have told them I don\u2019t like being called names and that I want to play but they won\u2019t listen. \u201d or \u201cThose boys keep coming up and pushing me. I have tried to stay away from them but they keep coming up to me and won\u2019t leave me alone.\u201d At school, teachers want children to try to solve their problems first. However, adult intervention is needed if this does not work.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>You say: \u201cThat\u2019s nice!\u201d as if you heard but did not actually listen. This is very common for busy adults.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Coach your child to touch your arm and keep going \u201cPlease, to listen to me this is important\u201d. Now you get irritated and say \u201cCan\u2019t you see I\u2019m busy!?\u201d</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Tell your child that sometimes adults get angry and don\u2019t understand but not to give up in asking for help and to say the specific problem again: \u201cI do not feel safe here because (state specific problem again) ______________.\u201d</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>You minimize and say: \u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal? Just stay away from them.\u201d</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Coach your child to persistent and say again, \u201cHaving this happen is making me feel bad about going to school. Please, I really need you to listen.\u201d</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Now change your demeanor so that your child can see you are listening and understanding and say \u201cOh! I am sorry I yelled at you and I am glad you are telling me. Tell me more and we will figure out what to do.\u201d</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Remind your child that, if the adult still does not listen, it is not his or her fault, but to keep asking until someone does something to fix the problem. Tell your child to please always tell you whenever she or he has a problem with anyone anywhere anytime. Ultimately, it is the responsibility of adults to create safe environments for the children in their lives and to be good role-models for our children by acting as their advocates in powerful respectful ways.</strong></span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>8. Using Physical Self-Defense as a Last Resort</strong></span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Children need to know when they have the right to hurt someone to stop that person from hurting them. At Kidpower, we teach that fighting is a last resort \u2013 when you are about to be harmed and you cannot leave or get help.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>However, bullying problems are often not as clear-cut as other personal safety issues. Families have different rules about where they draw the line. Schools will often punish a child who fights back unless parents warn the school in writing ahead of time that, since the school has not protected their children, they will back their children up if they have to fight.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Learning physical self defense helps most children become more confident, even if they never have to use these skills in a real-life situation. Just being more confident helps children to avoid being chosen as a victim most of the time. There are different self defense techniques for bullying than for more dangerous situations \u2014 let your child practice a self defense move like kicking someone in the shins, pinching someone\u2019s leg or upper arm, or hitting someone in the chest. You can practice in the air or by holding a sofa cushion.

Dating. Part of me genuinely believed I would never date again because I had a child. And what man wants a woman with a child? But there are guys out there who don&#8217;t automatically rule out dating single moms&#8211;for real! The problem, of course, is coordinating these dates. Finding a babysitter, sometimes at the absolute last minute isn&#8217;t always easy. Answering panicked phone calls from said babysitter during your date is even harder.</strong></span></p>\n<p id=\"yui_3_9_1_15_1376772622882_402\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a02. Relationships. The complexities of getting into a\u00a0relationship\u00a0with someone other than your child&#8217;s father are the subject of a whole different blog post. Maybe even a book. But to sum things up, there is the question of when and how to explain the relationship to your kid; how much time your new boyfriend should spend around your child; balancing time with your boyfriend along with time with your child. It&#8217;s a never-ending juggling act and it is not easy.\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<p id=\"yui_3_9_1_15_1376772622882_411\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a03. Your relationship with the other parent. My ex and I initially separated on good terms, but that all went out the window when I (a) started dating something else and (b) took him to court for\u00a0child support. We rarely speak now and when we do, I keep it as short as possible so that it won&#8217;t escalate. My daughter still obviously loves him very much, so having to lie to her about how &#8220;wonderful&#8221; he is is a real pain in my&#8230;\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<p id=\"yui_3_9_1_15_1376772622882_413\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>4. Milestones. I was watching an episode of\u00a0<i>Glee</i>\u00a0and\u00a0Idina Menzel&#8217;s character nailed this one on the head. She was explaining how it&#8217;s obviously hard to deal with a crying baby when there are dishes to wash, laundry to be done and no one to help. But it&#8217;s even harder, however, when your child takes his/her first steps, or says his/her first words and there is no one there to look over and celebrate with. Word.\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>5. Stress. Feeling like your kid&#8217;s entire success in life rests solely on your shoulders is a quite a bit of pressure. Is she smart enough, will he\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.momfinds.com/2011/how-much-is-too-much-to-pay-for-your-childs-education/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">get into that school</span></a>, why can&#8217;t they stop sucking their thumbs? It helps to have someone who is equally invested in your kid talk you off the ledge when you feel like these little things signal total failure for your kid.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>6. Alone time. Is basically non-existent. Fortunately, I really love spending time with my daughter and having her around me. But even so, there are times when I wish I just didn&#8217;t have to clean to the soundtrack of\u00a0<i>Yo Gabba Gabba</i>\u00a0in the background.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>7. Money. Even millionaires complain about how expensive raising a child is, so the money factor affects all parents. But if, as single parent, you&#8217;re not receiving any financial help from the other parent, there&#8217;s even more of a strain.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>8. Resentment. Full disclosure: I totally resent my daughter&#8217;s father for being able to hang out with his friends whenever, go on impromptu trips and buy whatever he wants because he isn&#8217;t responsible for the day-to-day care of our daughter. I would love to just go on vacay without tons of planning beforehand. That being said, I wouldn&#8217;t trade places with him in a heartbeat. He&#8217;s missed so much of her growing up&#8211;I just couldn&#8217;t live with myself if I wasn&#8217;t there for those firsts.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>9. Guilt. When I see seemingly happy families with two parents strolling down the street when it&#8217;s just my daughter and me, I always feel self-conscious. My daughter deserves that, but\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.momfinds.com/2011/who-comes-first-you-or-your-kid/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">I will never, under any circumstances, get back together with her dad</span></a>. Because I&#8217;m so sure of that, I can&#8217;t help but feel really guilty.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>10. Anger. When I put my daughter on time out, she&#8217;ll scream and cry at the top of her lungs, &#8220;I want my daddy.&#8221; It is literally like a knife through my heart. &#8220;If she only knew,&#8221; I think to myself. &#8220;At least I am here, trying to make you a better person.

Doctors Marshall H. Klaus and John H. Kennell explored the concept of bonding in their classic\u00a0<a id=\"FALINK_3_0_2\" href=\"http://www.attachmentparenting.org/support/articles/artbonding.php#\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">book</span></a>\u00a0Maternal-Infant Bonding. These researchers speculated that for humans, just as for other types of animals, there is a &#8220;sensitive period&#8221; at birth when mothers and newborns are uniquely programmed to be in contact with each other and do good things to each other. By comparing mother-infant pairs who bonded immediately after birth with those who didn&#8217;t, they concluded that the early-contact mother-infant pairs later developed a closer attachment.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Bonding is really a continuation of the relationship that began during pregnancy. The physical and chemical changes that were occurring in your body reminded you of the presence of this person. Birth cements this bond and gives it reality. Now you can see, feel, and talk to the little person whom you knew only as the &#8220;bulge&#8221; or from the movements and the heartbeat you heard through medical instruments. Bonding allows you to transfer your life-giving love for the infant inside to caregiving love on the outside. Inside, you gave your blood; outside, you give your milk, eyes, hands, and voice&#8211;your entire self.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Bonding brings mothers and newborns back together. Bonding studies provided the catalyst for family-oriented birthing policies in hospitals. It brought babies out of nurseries to room-in with their mothers. Bonding research reaffirmed the importance of the mother as the newborn&#8217;s primary\u00a0<a id=\"FALINK_1_0_0\" href=\"http://www.attachmentparenting.org/support/articles/artbonding.php#\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">caregiver</span></a>.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Bonding is not a now-or-never phenomenon. Bonding during this biologically sensitive period gives the parent-infant relationship a head start. However, immediate bonding after birth is not like instant glue that cements a parent-child relationship forever. The overselling of bonding has caused needless guilt for mothers who, because of medical complication, were temporarily separated from their babies after birth. Epidemics of bonding blues have occurred in mothers who had cesarean births or who had premature babies in intensive care units.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>What about the baby who for some reason, such as prematurity or cesarean birth, is temporarily separated form his mother after birth? Is the baby permanently affected by the loss of this early contact period? Catch-up bonding is certainly possible, especially in the resilient human species. The conception of bonding as an absolute critical period or a now-or-never relationship is not true. From birth through infancy and childhood there are many steps that lead to a strong mother-infant attachment. As soon as mothers and babies are reunited, creating a strong mother-infant connection by practicing the attachment style of parenting can compensate for the loss of this early opportunity. We have seen adopting parents who, upon first contact with their one-week-old newborn, express feeling as deep and caring as those of biological parents in the delivery room.</strong></span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Father-Newborn Bonding</strong></span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Most of the bonding research has focused on mother-infant bonding, with the father given only honorable mention. In recent years fathers, too, have been the subject of bonding research and have even merited a special term for the father-infant relationship at birth&#8211;&#8221;engrossment.&#8221; We used to talk about father involvement; now it&#8217;s father engrossment&#8211;meaning involvement to a higher degree. Engrossment is not only what the father does for the baby&#8211;holding and comforting&#8211; but also what the baby does for the father. Bonding with baby right after birth brings out sensitivity in dad.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Fathers are often portrayed as well meaning, but bumbling, when caring for newborns. Fathers are sometimes considered secondhand nurturers, nurturing the mother as she nurtures the baby. That&#8217;s only half the story. Fathers have their own unique way of relating to babies, and babies thrive on this difference.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>In fact,\u00a0<a id=\"FALINK_2_0_1\" href=\"http://www.attachmentparenting.org/support/articles/artbonding.php#\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">studies</span></a>\u00a0on father bonding show that fathers who are given the opportunity and are encouraged to take an active part in caring for their newborns can become just as nurturing as mothers. A father&#8217;s nurturing responses may be less automatic and slower to unfold than a mother&#8217;s, but fathers are capable of a strong bonding attachment to their infants during the newborn period.</strong></span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>7 Tips For Better Bonding</strong></span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>1. Delay routine procedures.\u00a0Oftentimes the attending nurse does routine procedures&#8211;giving the vitamin K shot and putting eye ointment in baby&#8217;s eyes&#8211;immediately after birth and then presents baby to mother for bonding. Ask the nurse to delay these procedures for an hour or so, allowing the family to enjoy this initial bonding period. The eye ointment temporarily blurs baby&#8217;s vision or causes her eyes to stay closed. She needs a clear first impression of you, and you need to see those eyes.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>2. Stay connected.\u00a0Ask your birth attendant and nurses to put baby on your abdomen and chest immediately after birth, or after cutting the cord and suctioning your baby, unless a medical complication requires temporary separation.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>3. Let your baby breastfeed right after birth.\u00a0Most babies are content simply to lick the nipple; others have a strong desire to suck at the breast immediately after birth. This nipple stimulation releases the hormone oxytocin, which increases the contractions of your uterus and lessens postpartum bleeding. Early sucking also stimulates the release of prolactin, the hormone that helps your mothering abilities click in right from the start.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>4. Room in with your baby.\u00a0Of course, bonding does not end at the delivery bed&#8211;it is just the beginning! Making visual, tactile, olfactory, auditory, and sucking connection with your baby right after birth may make you feel that you don&#8217;t want to release this little person that you&#8217;ve labored so hard to bring into the world, into the nursery&#8211;and you don&#8217;t have to. Your wombmate can now become your roommate. We advise healthy mothers and healthy babies to remain together throughout their hospital stay.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Who cares for your baby after delivery depends upon your health, your baby&#8217;s health, and your feelings. Some babies make a stable transition from the womb to the outside world without any complications; others need a few hours in the nursery for extra warmth, oxygen, suctioning, and other special attention until their vital systems stabilize.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Feelings after birth are as individual as feelings after lovemaking. Many mothers show the immediate glow of motherhood and the &#8220;birth high&#8221; excitement of a race finished and won. It&#8217;s love at first sight, and they can&#8217;t wait to get their hands on their baby and begin mothering within a millisecond after birth.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Others are relieved that the mammoth task of birth is over and that baby is normal. Now they are more interested in sleeping and recovering than bonding and mothering. As one mother said following a lengthy and arduous labor, &#8220;Let me sleep for a few hours, take a shower, comb my hair, and then I&#8217;ll start mothering.&#8221; If these are your feelings, enjoy your rest&#8211;you&#8217;ve earned it. There is no need to succumb to pressure bonding when neither your body nor mind is willing or able. In this case, father can bond with baby while mother rests. The important thing is somebody is bonding during this sensitive period of one to two hours of quiet alertness after birth. One of the saddest sights we see is a newly-born, one-hour-old baby parked all alone in the nursery, busily bonding (with wide-open, hungry eyes) with plastic sides of her bassinet. Give your baby a significant presence&#8211;mother, father, or even grandma in a pinch.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>5. Touch your baby.\u00a0Besides enjoying the stimulation your baby receives from the skin-to-skin contact of tummy-to-tummy and cheek-to-breast, gently stroke your baby, caressing his whole body. We have noticed that mothers and fathers often caress their babies differently. A new mother usually strokes her baby&#8217;s entire body with a gentle caress of her fingertips; the father, however, often places an entire hand on his baby&#8217;s head, as if symbolizing his commitment to protect the life he has fathered. Besides being enjoyable, stroking the skin is medically beneficial to the newborn. The skin, the largest organ in the human body, is very rich with nerve endings. At the time when baby is making the transition to air breathing, and the initial breathing patterns are very irregular, stroking stimulates the newborn to breathe more rhythmically&#8211;the therapeutic value of a parent&#8217;s touch.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>6. Gaze at your newborn.\u00a0Your newborn can see you best with an eye-to-eye distance of eight to ten inches (twenty to twenty-five centimeters)&#8211;amazingly, about the usual nipple-to-eye distance during breastfeeding. Place your baby in the face-to-face position, adjusting your head and your baby&#8217;s head in the same position so that your eyes meet. Enjoy this visual connection during the brief period of quiet alertness after birth, before baby falls into a deep sleep. Staring into your baby&#8217;s eyes may trigger a rush of beautiful mothering feelings.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>7. Talk to your newborn.\u00a0During the first hours and days after birth, a natural baby-talk dialogue will develop between mother and infant. Voice-analysis studies have shown a unique rhythm and comforting cadence to mother&#8217;s voice.</strong></span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Rooming-In vs. Nursery Care</strong></span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Rooming-in.\u00a0This is the option we encourage most mothers and babies to enjoy. Full rooming-in allows you to exercise your mothering instincts when the hormones in your body are programmed for it. In our experience, and that of others who study newborns, mothers and babies who fully room-in enjoy the following benefits:</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Rooming-in babies seem more content because they interact with only one primary caregiver&#8211;mother.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Full rooming-in changes the caregiving mindset of the attending personnel. They focus their attention and care on the mother, who is then more comfortable and able to focus on her baby.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Rooming-in newborns cry less and more readily organize their sleep-wake cycles. Babies in a large nursery are sometimes soothed by tape recordings of a human heartbeat or music. Rather than being soothed electronically, the baby who is rooming-in with mother is soothed by real and familiar sounds.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Mother has fewer breastfeeding problems. Her milk appears sooner, and baby seems more satisfied.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Rooming-in babies get less jaundiced, probably because they get more milk.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>A rooming-in mother usually gets more rest. She experiences less separation anxiety, not wasting energy worrying about her newborn in the nursery, and in the first few days newborns sleep most of the time anyway. It&#8217;s a myth that mothers of nursery-reared babies get more rest.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Rooming-in mothers, in our experience, have a lower incidence of postpartum depression.</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Rooming-in is especially helpful for women who have difficulty jumping right into mothering. One day while making rounds I visited Jan, a new mother, only to find her sad. &#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221; I inquired. She confided, &#8220;All those gushy feelings I&#8217;m supposed to have about my baby&#8211;well, I don&#8217;t. I&#8217;m nervous, tense, and don&#8217;t know what to do.&#8221; I encouraged Jan, &#8220;Love at first sight doesn&#8217;t happen to every couple, in courting or in parenting. For some mother-infant pairs it is a slow and gradual process. Don&#8217;t worry&#8211;your baby will help you, but you have to set the conditions that allow the mother-infant care system to click in.&#8221; I went on to explain what these conditions were.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>All babies are born with a group of special qualities called attachment-promoting behaviors&#8211;features and behaviors designed to alert the caregiver to the baby&#8217;s presence and draw the caregiver, magnet-like, toward the baby. These features are the roundness of baby&#8217;s eyes, cheeks, and body; the softness of the skin; the relative bigness of baby&#8217;s eyes; the penetrating gaze; the incredible newborn scent; and, perhaps, most important of all, baby&#8217;s early language&#8211;the cries and precrying noises.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Here&#8217;s how the early mother-infant communication system works. The opening sounds of the baby&#8217;s cry activate a mother&#8217;s emotions. This is physical as well as psychological. Upon hearing her baby cry, a mother experiences an increased blood flow to her breasts, accompanied by the biological urge to pick up and nurse her baby. This is one of the strongest examples of how the biological signals of the baby trigger a biological response in the mother. There is no other signal in the world that sets off such intense responses in a mother as her baby&#8217;s cry. At no other time in the child&#8217;s life will language so forcefully stimulate the mother to act.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Picture what happens when babies and mothers room-in together. Baby begins to cry. Mother, because she is there and physically attuned to baby, immediately picks up and feeds her infant. Baby stops crying. When baby again awakens, squirms, grimaces, and then cries, mother responds in the same manner. The next time mother notices her baby&#8217;s precrying cues. When baby awakens, squirms, and grimaces, mother picks up and feeds baby before he has to cry. She has learned to read her baby&#8217;s signals and to respond appropriately. After rehearsing this dialogue many times during the hospital stay, mother and baby are working as a team. Baby learns to cue better; mother learns to respond better. As the attachment-promoting cries elicit a hormonal response in the mother, her milk-ejection reflex functions smoothly, and mother and infant are in biological harmony.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Now contrast this rooming-in scene with that of an infant cared for in the hospital nursery. Picture this newborn infant lying in a plastic box. He awakens, hungry, and cries along with twenty other hungry babies in plastic boxes who have by now all managed to awaken one another. A kind and caring nurse hears the cries and responds as soon as time permits, but she has no biological attachment to this baby, no inner programming tuned to that particular newborn, nor do her hormones change when the baby cries. The crying, hungry baby is taken to her mother in due time. The problem is that the baby&#8217;s cry has two phases: The early sounds of the cry have an attachment-promoting quality, whereas the later sounds of the unattended cry are more disturbing to listen to and may actually promote avoidance.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>The mother who has missed the opening scene in this biological drama because she was not present when her baby started to cry is nonetheless expected to give a nurturing response to her baby some minutes later. By the time the nursery-reared baby is presented to the mother, the infant has either given up crying and gone back to sleep (withdrawal from pain) or greets the mother with even more intense and upsetting wails. The mother, who possesses a biological attachment to the baby, nevertheless hears only the cries that are more likely to elicit agitated concern rather than tenderness. Even though she has a comforting breast to offer the baby, she may be so tied up in knots that her milk won&#8217;t eject, and the baby cries even harder.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>As she grows to doubt her ability to comfort her baby, the infant may wind up spending more time in the nursery, where, she feels, the &#8220;experts&#8221; can better care for him. This separation leads to more missed cues and breaks in the attachment between mother and baby, and they go home from the hospital without knowing each other.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Not so with the rooming-in baby. He awakens in his mother&#8217;s room, his pre-cry signals are promptly attended to, and he is put to the breast either before he needs to cry or at least before the initial attachment-promoting cry develops into a disturbing cry. Thus, both mother and baby profit from rooming-in. Infants cry less, mothers exhibit more mature coping skills toward their baby&#8217;s crying, and the infant-distress syndrome (fussiness, colic, incessant crying) is less common than with nursery-reared babies. We had a saying in the newborn unit: &#8220;Nursery-reared babies cry harder; rooming-in babies cry better.&#8221; A better term for &#8220;rooming-in&#8221; may be &#8220;fitting in.&#8221; By spending time together and rehearsing the cue-response dialogue, baby and mother learn to fit together well&#8211;and bring out the best in each other.</strong></span></p>\n", "post_id": 1664,

They became rich farmers, married (two non-identical sisters), had children. Incredibly, the Siamese twins were accepted as respected members of White pre-Civil War society and were even slave owners.</p>\n<p>Their conjoined status created some oddities in their personal lives. When the twins first married they set up a communal household but their wives did not get along and so the twins set up separate homes, with the twins dividing their time between each home.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"mod_815457\">\n<h2>9.

I <em>can</em> tell the difference now, because we don\u2019t look anything alike anymore.<br>\nIf there was a secret it would seriously just be getting to know us (or another set of twins you\u2019re interested in befriending).<br>\nWhen most people meet us they think we look exactly alike. After a week or two they can\u2019t understand how they could ever have thought we looked anything alike because we\u2019re so different. It just goes along the lines of how different twins are personality-wise.</p>\n\n<p>P.S. It\u2019s our 24th birthday today and our mom posted this photo on Facebook. None of us have any idea who\u2019s who.<a href=\"http://mormonolsentwins.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/twin.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-91\" src=\"http://mormonolsentwins.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/twin.jpg?w=300&#038;h=235\" height=\"235\" width=\"300\" alt=\"baby twins\"></a></p>\n\n<p>make a guess in the comments below at who\u2019s who!</p>\n</div><p class=\"reblog-source\"><a href=\"http://mormonolsentwins.wordpress.com/2013/08/22/secrets-of-telling-twins-apart/\">View original</a></p></div></div>", "post_id": 1710, "location": false, "date": "08-26-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["FAMILY", "postaday", "poetry", "motherhood", "twins", "home"], "text": "<h2 style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1713\" alt=\"wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww\" src=\"https://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww.jpg?w=221&#038;h=300\" width=\"221\" height=\"300\" /></a></h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>I once had a teacher who was out for a day and her sister came to sub&#8230;needless to say she looked exactly like our teacher and no one noticed the difference&#8230;that is until she spent 7 whole minutes telling us.</strong></span></h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1 style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Can&#8217;t You Tell Us Apart</strong></span></h1>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>\u00a9 Carconti Etva</strong></span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>To be a twin is an experience I&#8217;ll say</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>being mistaken for another all day</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Are you Gabby or Abby</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Tori or Tray</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>sometimes I wonder why we are this way</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>I&#8217;d like to be one of a kind</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>and not mistaken for Madeline</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>some people I know are simply just toying</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>but some times it&#8217;s just really annoying</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>I mean come on how dim can you be</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>can you really not tell she&#8217;s different from me</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>sometimes I&#8217;m depressed at the end of the day</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>from everyone thinking I&#8217;m my sister, Anna May</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>But I&#8217;m grateful for my twin</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>And so I grin</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>As someone mistakes me for my brother, Ben</strong></span></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n", "post_id": 1711, "location": false, "date": "08-27-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["shining lights", "life", "postaday", "time in history", "self knowledge", "entire world", "liveing in the 21st centry", "core ideas", "people have different paths"], "text": "<h1></h1>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><a href=\"http://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/21st.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1717\" alt=\"21st\" src=\"https://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/21st.jpg?w=300&#038;h=196\" width=\"300\" height=\"196\" /></a></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">I\u2019ve spent more than my share of time staring at the problem of living effectively in the digital age we find ourselves in. In that time a few core ideas keep popping up, basic concepts that I think will become the foundations on which the next stage of our economy is built. The following are 49 points that I believe make up the basis of this new system, while the list is by no means exhaustive I do believe that it is comprehensive.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">1. For the first time in history we all have the tools to craft our own jobs and set the course of our own lives.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">2. This does not imply that it is easy or right for everyone, different people have different paths to meaning.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">3. All the meaning and happiness in our lives is wrapped up in doing something incredibly hard, for an incredibly long time that we can believe in right down to the core of our beings.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">4. Our greatest failure in life is that we rarely take a moment to discover this belief \u2014 what makes us tick, what brings us meaning, the reason that we keep breathing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">5. There is this idea that working from 9-5, 5 days a week at a job you basically hate is the only rational path to meaning \u2014 the modern economy is proving this notion false.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">6. The modern economy rewards those who understand that a career is an ideology, a point of view, not merely a daily grind designed to keep us in bread and beans.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">7. The modern economy rewards those who can separate themselves from the sea of resumes by shining a light on the talents and expertise that distinguish them as individual human lives.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">8. \u201cShining lights\u201d and all that is not easy work, it requires self knowledge and a deep belief in your own value.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">9. One of those values is that we\u2019re all entrepreneurs, we can all be agents of change \u2014 big, small or otherwise.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">10. Change does not necessarily mean changing the entire world, it can be just as meaningful to change your neighborhood or your household.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">11. Most people have no idea what they\u2019re good at and walk around blindly thinking they are boring and colorless, get over this lie and start nurturing your talents.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">12. A job is what you\u00a0<em>do</em>\u00a0to pay the bills, a career is what you\u00a0<em>live within</em>\u00a0to improve your world, you take on one to work towards the other.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">13. Until your career can pay your bills, it\u2019s probably prudent not to give up your job.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">14. Without goals however, the job will consume your life, establish goals and spend as much energy as you have available to work towards them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">15. If you\u2019re not learning you\u2019re dying, if you\u2019re not adapting you\u2019re being left behind, the world changes in a blink and so must you.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">16. Be on the lookout for any technology that makes your life easier.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">17. Be certain to ignore all technologies that don\u2019t.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">18. The best ideas have always been simple to explain, never get caught up in your own complexity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">19. Time is and has always been your currency, the thrust of life should be towards earning more of it and using what you earn more wisely.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">20. To that end, automate everything that you can, that will leave room to concentrate on all of those things that you can\u2019t.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">21. Money should always be a tool and never and end in and of itself, spend it freely if it helps to grow your business your knowledge or your happiness.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">22. The things that we do are always more memorable than the things that we have, understand that long term happiness is always drawn from experiences rather than possessions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">23. Your possessions should be shaped and determined by your life, your life should never be shaped and determined by your possessions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">24. Maintain a broad perspective on the world, learn what you can about as much as you can and bring that wisdom into everything you do.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">25. Genius is combining two seemingly unlike things into a third in a unique way, genius requires perspective and punishes those who see the world through the mouth of a tunnel.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">26. Never underestimate your capacity for error, being human means being irrational.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">27. Everything, especially error and trauma has a lesson to teach, learn to treat failure as a tool rather than as a penalty.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">28. Don\u2019t let work consume you, a few hours of time off can grant more perspective than a few days in front of a desk.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">29. Understand that the trappings of success are less important and less valuable to you than success itself, that the culture of fame and wealth is as much a trap as it is something to strive towards.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">30. Never add unnecessary complexity to your life, complexity consumes times.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">31. Never hire an employee when a contractor will do, never hire a contractor when an employee is necessary.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">32. Your dreams of a fancy corner office with a huge wooden desk probably has little or nothing to do with the goals of your business, often we are better off giving up the former for the latter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">33. Learn how to build a website, put up a blog, design a mobile application, work within the context of the web \u2014 the Internet is here to stay and those skills will drive the future forward.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">34. The only things that can\u2019t be outsourced are clever thoughts and the brass to speak your mind. Cultivate your ability to communicate your thoughts and the courage to implement your ideas.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">35. Accept advice willingly, seek it out \u2014 in the end you will ignore most of it, but you\u2019ll change everything because of the rest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">36. Give something back to the world.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">37. Develop an interest in the problems of others, make time for voices outside of your head.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">38. Travel as often as you can, get some perspective on the world outside of your front door.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">39. Learn another language, you never can tell where your next client will come from.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">40. Nurture your relationships, your work should never become the sole driver of your life.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">41. Save like you\u2019re going to spend 20% of your life miserably unemployed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">42. Learn to invest what you save, never underestimate the power of compound interest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">43. That being said, an iron clad law of investing is that the more complex your strategy the more likely you will end up spectacularly poor because of it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">44. Never take on debt you don\u2019t need, but understand when debt can acutally serve a need.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">45. Like money, ideas are wealth and should be saved as you would anything else, write all of them down and store them away for a rainy day.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">46. Build those ideas that you are capable of producing well, develop a sense of your strengths and your weaknesses, and have the courage not to get wrapped up in one to the exclusion of the other.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">47. Ideas are your fuel and fertilizer, believe in them, embrace them and challenge them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">48. Challenge your perspective constantly, always assume that you are wrong and strive towards becoming more right.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">49. In the end, be the sort of person that someone can believe in, that you can believe in, that whatever small part of the world that you care about can believe in.</span></p>\n", "post_id": 1716, "location": false, "date": "09-01-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<div class=\"wpcom-reblog-snapshot\"> <div class=\"reblog-post\"><p class=\"reblog-from\"><img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a9392739bc34b583f1ee97904919f047?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />Originally posted on <a href=\"http://dfdancesinlife.com/2013/09/01/how-do-you-handle-waiting/\">The Dragonfly Dances in Life</a>:</p><div class=\"reblogged-content\">\n<p>Waiting, wait time, cooling your heels, being patient, taking your turn.\u00a0 Let\u2019s face it in our present society norm, waiting is not something that any one does easily.\u00a0 We are to a point where sitting back and just BEING while waiting makes one\u2019s blood pressure rise.\u00a0 Some people might even feel stressed unless they can come up with something to do to fill the void in activity.</p>\n\n<p>Think about it.\u00a0 What do you do when waiting in line at the check out counter at the grocery store?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://dfdancesinlife.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/waiting-3.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-619 aligncenter\" src=\"http://dfdancesinlife.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/waiting-3.jpg?w=251&#038;h=201\" height=\"201\" width=\"251\" alt=\"waiting 3\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Do you read the magazine titles?\u00a0 Pick one up and leaf through it?\u00a0 Scan the candy bar and gum racks?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://dfdancesinlife.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/waiting-2.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-618 aligncenter\" src=\"http://dfdancesinlife.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/waiting-2.jpg?w=259&#038;h=194\" height=\"194\" width=\"259\" alt=\"waiting 2\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Check your email on your phone?\u00a0 Play Words with Friends?\u00a0 Check out friends\u2019 statuses on Facebook?\u00a0 Have you ever in a really long line resorted to reading the back of the boxes and bags of food in your cart?\u00a0 (Yeah, I\u2019m guilty of\u2026</p>\n</div><p class=\"reblog-source\"><a href=\"http://dfdancesinlife.com/2013/09/01/how-do-you-handle-waiting/\">View original</a> <span class=\"more-words\">588 more words</span></p></div></div>", "post_id": 1719, "location": false, "date": "09-01-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["21st centry", "poems", "postaday", "poetry"], "text": "<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.4to40.com/images/poems/Child_of_21st_Century/Child_of_21st_Century.gif\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>He shall, he be,</strong><br />\n<strong>The child of 21st century?\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>With a big, great head</strong><br />\n<strong>Wheels for legs and guns for hands</strong><br />\n<strong>\u00a0</strong><br />\n<strong>Computer for a brain,\u00a0</strong><br />\n<strong>A machine for a heart\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>A nose with an oxygen mask\u00a0</strong><br />\n<strong>And eyes with a microscope.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>With no sentiment nor emotion,\u00a0</strong><br />\n<strong>With no feeling of love&#8230;</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>Only feeling of hatred</strong><br />\n<strong>Only thoughts of violence\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>With no care of humanity</strong><br />\n<strong>With on thoughts of brotherhood.</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>Oh!

The meaning of these dreams is that someone, something (possibly something as obscure as an emotion) is making you feel threatened. One way to determine the root of the threat is to ask yourself who or what in your real life most closely resembles the \u201ccreature\u201d or circumstance in your dream.

The meaning of this dream is that you are feeling exposed, awkward, or vulnerable, or you are afraid that you have revealed too much of yourself (such as a secret or a very personal feeling) in a real life situation.

Occasionally we may be sinking in water (and in danger of drowning). Typically a person having this dream is feeling insecure or lacking in support in their waking life.

We dream to be generous, giving, thankful, grateful. We\u00a0dream of good family values, so that we instill them in our children.

Rather than an early bedtime, think of this season as a planting opportunity to be grabbed with both hands; not only is there a rich palette of grasses and perennials to be explored, but the crystal clear light of autumn adds jewel-box sparkle to herbaceous borders. As the sun sinks lower, it slants through airy stems picking up texture, silhouette and movement in fading light. When frost arrives the seed heads sparkle and, if you\u2019re lucky, hungry flocks of finches frisk through.</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Now, of course, is the ideal time to plant, so pick a site that will be spotlit by the low sun and visit some well-planted autumn gardens for inspiration (see box). You need to plant in threes at least, and balance those dominant golden yellows with strong foxy reds, purples, pinks, mulberries and deep blues. This prevents a late-flowering scheme from taking on the bilious look of piccalilli. Autumn is also daisy time, and the aster family is invaluable. Long before flowers appear, the tiny buds, the black stems, the whorls of leaf that unfold from sheathed cigarillo-like stems hold the eye.</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>The daisy flowers, like spinning saucers, tend to face heavenwards as they wait for a late butterfly or two, and they need contrasting shapes to prevent monotony \u2013 vertical spikes and spires, airy wands, umbels and bobbles. A grassy backbone is an essential too, because grasses add movement and unite your planting.</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Spikes and spires</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Connect ground to sky with spikes and spires, such as those of the September-flowering, rich blue monkshood bred by Georg Arends in 1945: Aconitum carmichaelii &#8216;Arendsii\u2019. The spires have black-lashed flowers in delphinium-blue supported by glossy foliage. And this one is fashionably late to flower, following &#8216;Sp\u00e4tlese\u2019, &#8216;Kelmscott\u2019 and &#8216;Barker\u2019s Variety\u2019. Aconitums flower in shade, but deadhead them to prevent inferior seedlings from taking hold. Be aware they are toxic, particularly the root, as the common name, wolf\u2019s bane, indicates.</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n<div id=\"tmg-related-links\" style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<h2></h2>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Other spikes, such as Veronicastrum virginicum, have faded now, but the five-feet-high tapering seed heads and black stems of &#8216;Fascination\u2019 look magical in low light. Waist-high verticals placed towards the front work well, too. These might include late-flowering red hot pokers, such as Kniphofia rooperi, which come through winter even in my cold garden. The warm-orange heads are well-spaced and crisp in outline.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Mopheads and bobbles</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Modern planting is airy by nature, so cloudlike heads, light umbels or bobbles should be part of the mix. In fertile ground the damson-red Eupatorium &#8216;Riesenschirm\u2019 will reach six feet, and its dark stems and whorled foliage are a bonus earlier in the year. Vernonia fasciculata, an aster relative known as smooth ironweed, provides an irregular puff of violet, and both set off Helianthus &#8216;Lemon Queen\u2019.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Puffs of paler smoke emerge from Selinum wallichianum, and its bright green lacy leaves and purple sheathing are prominent for months. I am also fond of Thalictrum lucidum for its lime-yellow down which contrasts with the high-gloss, lance-shaped herringbone of leaves. Add a late sanguisorba, ideally &#8216;Cangshan Cranberry\u2019, with maroon bobbles that darken into winter.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>The shorter Verbena hastata f. rosea lasts well into autumn, with spires of tiny violet-purple flowers that branch into a candelabra arrangement. But the airiest of all is the tall Althaea cannabina, a wiry mallow with small raspberry-eyed pink saucers threaded along the stems intermittently.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Dazzling daisies</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Every gardener should grow the three-feet-high bushy aster &#8216;Little Carlow\u2019, with lavender-blue flowers that appear from red buds like a gas torch. Aster laevis &#8216;Calliope\u2019 has paler, slightly ragged daisies, but it\u2019s really grown for its substantial black presence. The floppier &#8216;Vasterival\u2019 tends toward pink but the sooty foliage and buds flatter the confetti-coloured flowers.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Use yellow as your spinning thread but do opt for tight clump-formers such as the green-coned Rudbeckia laciniata &#8216;Herbstsonne\u2019 and the lemon-yellow sunflower Helianthus &#8216;Lemon Queen\u2019, rather than the rabid spreaders. Like all sunflowers, the latter will chase the sun, so place it carefully and find dusky partners for both. I also like the cool-lemon daisy Ratibida pinnata which droops its petals in a swoon. Commonly known as the yellow cone flower, this can flower in July following an early spring, but normally it comes later. Finally, find room for a brown and yellow front-of-the-border daisy (such as Rudbeckia fulgida var. sullivantii &#8216;Goldsturm\u2019 or Rudbeckia tricolor) and some echinaceas. &#8216;Fatal Attraction\u2019, a black-stemmed Day-Glo pink, is the flashiest.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Transparent grasses</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>The following grasses are well-behaved and don\u2019t run, or self-seed to nuisance levels in Britain.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Stipa gigantea, a tall golden oat grass, is early season but keeps a skeletal presence as it forms its Roman fountain of golden sparks. A tendency to untidiness can be fixed by removing ungainly stems.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>If you\u2019ve room enough, the July-flowering toetoe grass from New Zealand, Cortaderia richardii, will produce one-sided feathery awns in shades of natural wool, above grey-green, sword-sharp foliage. Both shine in low light.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Cast an airy veil with Molinia caerulea subsp. arundinacea &#8216;Transparent\u2019, which provides a mist of darkish beads. Tall molinias always have subsp. arundinacae in their title, but they vary greatly in form and are often wrongly named. Use a specialist nursery (see box). If you can\u2019t find &#8216;Transparent\u2019, grow Molinia &#8216;Karl Foerster\u2019 instead. Also make use of the upright Calamagrostis x acutiflora &#8216;Karl Foerster\u2019, its stems rise like a rocket heading to Mars.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Miscanthus sinensis is the most essential of all grasses, although some varieties are grown for foliage, not their plumed flower. The fine-tined, variegated green and cream &#8216;Morning Light\u2019, for instance, and the thicker leaved brash white and green &#8216;Cosmopolitan\u2019 are for foliage. My favourite, with light green leaves subtly banded in gold, is &#8216;P\u00fcnktchen\u2019, but even in good summers the flower heads are hardly noticeable here. &#8216;Ferner Osten\u2019 does produce lots of wine-red plums, although these will turn mink-brown within three to four weeks, whatever the weather.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>If you\u2019ve never grown a miscanthus, the most reliably floriferous is &#8216;Silberfeder\u2019, which performs in cool and more northerly gardens. Add a pennisetum to curtsy at the front of the border; the pale brown caterpillars of &#8216;Hameln\u2019 survive bad winters in my cold garden. Finally, add the silky feathers of Stipa brachytricha, again at the front, as their mauve heads pick up the colour of almost every aster.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>By threading grasses through your late-season borders you\u2019ll find that the dying of the light has never looked more beautiful.</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n", "post_id": 1789, "location": false, "date": "10-05-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<div

A good, thick zip up jacket is perfect for cold weather. It&#8217;s warm, but also easy to put on and off. Get rid of those cotton jackets, buy a leather or a good polyester jacket instead! Don&#8217;t wear hoodies in extremely cold weather as this allows the wind to go through the fibers. without the wind chill, you will be a lot warmer, so make sure you have a windproof jacket. Try synthetics like Gortex that let your sweat escape if you are doing vigorous activities like skiing.\n<div></div>\n</li>\n<li>Other accessories such as gloves, scarves and beanies. All of these items can add flair to your outfit while also keeping you toasty.\n<div></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div></div>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Pack warm food. Sometimes all you need in chilly conditions is hot food or drink. Good ideas are soup or noodles. Keep these in a flask and carry them around in a bag with you for lunch, rather than stale, cold sandwiches.

It might rhyme, but it doesn\u2019t have to. It can be long or short, happy or sad, funny or serious. The only thing that I think all poems should have is rhythm. Even then, it does not need to be a thumping in-your-face metre, it can be quite subtle, so that readers barely notice it until they look closely, or read it aloud and hear and feel the cadence.</p>\n\n<p>One of the <strong>challenges of poetry writing</strong> is attempting to write in a conventional verse form. I have written sonnets, triolets, pantoums, haiku, villanelles, couplets, quintains \u2026 but when I want a bit of light fun, I write <strong>limericks</strong>. Traditionally, these tend to be funny poems. Their light, insistent rhythm leads easily to a <em>boom-boom</em> pay off\u2026</p>\n</div><p class=\"reblog-source\"><a href=\"http://celiawarren.wordpress.com/2013/09/10/getting-kicks-from-lim-er-icks/\">View original</a> <span class=\"more-words\">316 more words</span></p></div></div>", "post_id": 1834, "location": false, "date": "10-13-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["FAMILY", "postaday", "manners", "children", "cats", "tips", "punishment"], "text": "<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/cat.jpg\"><br />\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1836\" alt=\"CAT\" src=\"https://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/cat.jpg?w=284&#038;h=177\" width=\"284\" height=\"177\" /></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>We had the same problem with our 3-year-old daughter and our cat. We begged her to be gentle. We tried to show her how to pet the cat, play with him gently, etc. We punished her with timeouts (and I admit, a spanking on more than one occasion) and nothing seemed to work EXCEPT&#8230;.. we did a complete turnaround and if she did anything even remotely hurtful to the cat, we made a HUGE fuss over the cat and completely ignored her, e.g. &#8220;oh, poor kitty! Are you okay? Poor baby! You got hurt.&#8221; It drove our daughter CRAZY and she stopped tormenting the cat within just a few days. Then, we really went out of our way to give her MEGA praise when she would treat the cat well. If we saw her petting the cat gently or playing with him nicely, we really played up how wonderful that was and would sometimes even surprise her with little prizes &#8212; &#8220;wow, you are so nice to the kitty &#8212; how would you like a sticker.&#8221; At Thanksgiving, my family was talking to us that we should give away the cat because of how our daughter was treating him. At Christmas, my family was praising us for getting our daughter&#8217;s behavior with him completely under control.

EARLY FAMILY LIFE</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Enid Mary Blyton was born on 11th August 1897 at 354 Lordship Lane, a two-bedroom flat above a shop in East Dulwich, South London. Shortly after her birth her parents moved to Beckenham in Kent and it was there, in a number of different houses over the years, that Enid Blyton spent her childhood. She had two younger brothers\u2014Hanly, born in 1899, and Carey, born in 1902.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>2. ENID AND HER FATHER, THOMAS CAREY BLYTON</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Enid&#8217;s father, Thomas, was a cutlery salesman as a young man. He then joined his uncle&#8217;s firm selling Yorkshire cloth and, later still, set up his own business as a clothing wholesaler. He and his daughter had a close, loving relationship\u2014both had dark hair and alert brown eyes, and shared an appetite for knowledge and a zest for life. Together they enjoyed nature rambles, gardening, the theatre, art, music and literature. When Enid had whooping cough as a baby, and was not expected to live till morning, her father refused to accept the doctor&#8217;s opinion and sat up all night with her, cradling her and willing her to survive.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Enid learnt a lot from her father, especially about nature. In her autobiography, The Story of My Life (1952), she wrote:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>&#8220;&#8230;my father loved the countryside, loved flowers and birds and wild animals, and knew more about them than anyone I had ever met. And what was more he was willing to take me with him on his expeditions, and share his love and his knowledge with me!</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>That was marvellous to me. It&#8217;s the very best way of learning about nature if you can go for walks with someone who really knows.&#8221;</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Thomas also taught his young daughter lessons that would stand her in good stead in daily life. When she wanted to plant seeds in her own patch of garden he made a bargain with her, saying:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>&#8220;If you want anything badly, you have to work for it. I will give you enough money to buy your own seeds, if you earn it. I want my bicycle cleaned\u2014cleaned well, too. And I want the weeds cleared from that bed over there. If the work is done properly, it is worth sixpence to me, and that will buy you six penny packets of seeds.&#8221;</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Enid appreciated the seeds, and the flowers which sprang up from them, all the more for having been made to work for them. Part of the pleasure and value lay in the fact that she had earned them for herself.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>3. ENID AND HER MOTHER, THERESA MARY BLYTON (NEE HARRISON)</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Although she adored her father, Enid&#8217;s relationship with her mother, Theresa, was more turbulent. Theresa was a tall, raven-haired woman whose life revolved around housework. She was not creative and artistic like Thomas, and did not share his interests. She expected her daughter to help with household chores but gave her sons a lot more freedom, which Enid, who was not very domesticated, resented. Stern and house-proud, Theresa did not approve of Enid devoting so much time to nature-walks, reading and other hobbies when there was work to be done in the house. Neither did she understand why her husband encouraged their daughter in such activities.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>4. FIRST SCHOOL</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Enid began her schooldays at a small school run by two sisters in a house called Tresco, almost opposite the Blyton home. As an adult, Enid Blyton said about the school:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>&#8220;I remember everything about it\u2014the room, the garden, the pictures on the wall, the little chairs, the dog there, and the lovely smells that used to creep out from the kitchen into our classroom when we sat doing dictation. I remember how we used to take biscuits for our mid-morning lunch and &#8216;swap&#8217; them with one another\u2014and how we used to dislike one small boy who was clever at swapping a small biscuit for a big one.&#8221;</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Enid&#8217;s days at Tresco were happy. She was a bright girl, blessed with a good memory, and she shone at art and nature study, though she struggled with mathematics.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>5. CHILDHOOD GAMES</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Games that Enid played as a child included Red Indians, Burglars and Policemen, building dens and playing with tops, hoops and marbles. Indoors she played card games, Snakes and Ladders, Draughts and Chess. Her father thought that all young children should learn to play Chess because &#8220;&#8230; if they have any brains it will train them to think clearly, quickly and to plan things a long way ahead. And if they haven&#8217;t any brains it will make the best of those they have!&#8221;</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>6. BOOKS THAT ENID READ AS A GIRL</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Enid loved reading. Among the books she read were Anna Sewell&#8217;s Black Beauty, Charles Kingsley&#8217;s The Water Babies and Louisa M. Alcott&#8217;s Little Women. She said of the characters in Little Women:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>&#8220;Those were real children&#8230; &#8216;When I grow up I will write books about real children,&#8217; I thought. &#8216;That&#8217;s the kind of book I like best. That&#8217;s the kind of book I would know how to write.&#8217;&#8221;</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Enid Blyton enjoyed myths and legends too, and poetry and annuals, and magazines like Strand Magazine and Punch. She was fascinated by Arthur Mee&#8217;s Children&#8217;s Encyclopaedia:</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>&#8220;It gave me my thirst for knowledge of all kinds, and taught me as much as ever I learnt at school.&#8221;</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Grimm&#8217;s fairy-tales she considered &#8220;cruel and frightening&#8221; and, although she liked Hans Christian Andersen&#8217;s stories, some of them were &#8220;too sad.&#8221; Among her favourite books were Lewis Carroll&#8217;s &#8220;Alice&#8221; books and R. M. Ballantyne&#8217;s The Coral Island, but the one she loved best of all, and read at least a dozen times, was The Princess and the Goblin by George MacDonald. What appealed to her &#8220;wasn&#8217;t so much the story as the strange &#8216;feel&#8217; of the tale, the &#8216;atmosphere&#8217; as we call it. It hung over me for a very long time, and gave me pleasant shivers.&#8221;</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>7. SENIOR SCHOOL</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>In 1907 Enid Blyton became a pupil at St. Christopher&#8217;s School for Girls in Beckenham. She was not a boarder, like so many of the characters in her books, but a day-girl. Intelligent, popular and full of fun, she threw herself wholeheartedly into school life. During her time at St. Christopher&#8217;s she organised concerts, played practical jokes, became tennis champion and captain of the lacrosse team, and was awarded prizes in various subjects, especially English composition. In her final two years she was appointed Head Girl.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Outside school she and two of her friends, Mary Attenborough and Mirabel Davis, created a magazine called Dab, for which Enid wrote short stories. The title of the magazine was formed from the initials of the contributors&#8217; surnames.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Enid&#8217;s first holiday abroad in 1913 was to stay with one of her French teachers, Mlle. Louise Bertraine, at her home in Annecy, France.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>8. HER PARENTS&#8217; SEPARATION</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Thomas and Theresa had little in common and grew more and more unhappy and frustrated in their marriage as the years passed. They had frequent violent rows, causing their children great distress. At night-time, Enid, Hanly and Carey would sit at the top of the stairs with their arms around one another for comfort, listening to their parents&#8217; heated arguments. One night, when Enid was not quite thirteen, the children heard their father state angrily that he was leaving and would not be coming back. To Enid&#8217;s shock she learnt that there was another woman in his life, Florence Agnes Delattre, a secretary, and that from now on he would be living with her.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Since marital breakdown was regarded as a scandal in suburban Beckenham in 1910, Theresa forced Enid and her brothers to pretend, if asked, that their father was merely &#8220;away on a visit.&#8221; This pretence, which the family kept up for years, appears to have left Enid with a lifelong tendency to cover up anything unpleasant and put on a fa\u00e7ade. In 1951 she wove this traumatic experience into a novel, The Six Bad Boys.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Her father&#8217;s leaving was hard for Enid to accept and she seems to have viewed it as a rejection of her personally. Years later, when she was married, she had difficulty conceiving a baby and was found to have an under-developed uterus, equivalent to that of a girl aged twelve or thirteen. It has been suggested that the trauma of her father&#8217;s departure may have had a long-term effect on her physical as well as her emotional development.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>9. EARLY WRITING</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Deprived of Thomas&#8217;s support and inspiration, Enid was now more than ever at the mercy of her mother, with whom she did not see eye to eye. To assuage her unhappiness she took to locking herself in her bedroom and writing compulsively, setting a pattern which was to be repeated in adulthood. She had a vivid imagination and had known for some time that she wanted to be a writer, and now she spent every spare minute honing her talent. Her mother despaired of her, dismissing her work as mere &#8220;scribbling.&#8221; Enid sent off numerous stories and poems to magazines in the hope that they would be published but, except for one poem which was printed by Arthur Mee in his magazine when she was fourteen, she had no luck at this stage, receiving hundreds of rejection slips. Her mother considered her efforts a &#8220;waste of time and money&#8221; but Enid was encouraged by her schoolfriend Mary&#8217;s aunt, Mabel Attenborough, who had become a good friend and confidante.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>10. MUSIC</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Towards the end of 1916 Enid Blyton was due to begin studying at the Guildhall School of Music. She had a gift for music and her family had always assumed that she would become a professional musician like her father&#8217;s sister, May Crossland. Throughout her childhood Enid had spent many hours practising the piano but, as she grew older, she begrudged devoting hours to the piano when she would rather be writing. She was aware that her true talent lay in telling stories, but found it impossible to convince her family of that.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>11. TEACHER-TRAINING</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>It was after a spell teaching Sunday School in the summer of 1916, while staying with friends of Mabel Attenborough at Seckford Hall near Woodbridge in Suffolk, that Enid suddenly knew what to do. She made up her mind to turn down her place at the Guildhall School of Music and train as a teacher instead. That would give her close contact with the children for whom she knew she wanted to write, and she would be able to study them and get to know their interests.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Enid lost no time in putting her plan into action and, in September 1916, she embarked upon a Froebel-based teacher-training course at Ipswich High School. Things had deteriorated badly between her and Theresa and it was around this time that Enid broke ties completely with her mother, spending holidays from college with the Attenboroughs rather than returning home to her mother and brothers. She kept in touch with her father, visiting him at his office in London, but she could not bring herself to accept Florence, with whom Thomas had had three more children, and she and her father were not as close as they had once been.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>12. FIRST RECORDED PUBLICATION OF AN ENID BLYTON WORK</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>In 1917 one of Enid&#8217;s poems, &#8220;Have You&#8230;?&#8221; was accepted for publication by Nash&#8217;s Magazine. Since a couple of earlier published poems (including the one printed in the Arthur Mee magazine) have never been traced, &#8220;Have You&#8230;?&#8221; is the first recorded publication of an Enid Blyton work.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>13. TEACHING</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Enid Blyton proved to be an inventive, energetic teacher and, after completing her training in December 1918, she taught for a year at a boys&#8217; preparatory school, Bickley Park School in Kent. Next she became governess to the four Thompson brothers, relatives of Mabel Attenborough, at a house called Southernhay in Surbiton, Surrey. She remained there for four years and, during that time, a number of children from neighbouring families also came to join her &#8220;experimental school,&#8221; as she called it. The accounts of lessons at &#8220;Miss Brown&#8217;s School&#8221; in Enid Blyton&#8217;s Book of the Year (1941) surely owe something to her years as a teacher at her own little school in Surbiton, which she later said was &#8220;one of the happiest times of my life.&#8221;</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>14. THE DEATH OF HER FATHER</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>It may have been a happy period on the whole but it was in 1920, while teaching at Southernhay, that Enid received the news that her father had died suddenly, of a heart attack, while out fishing on the Thames. At least, that is what she was told but the truth was that he had suffered a stroke and died in an armchair at home in Sunbury, where he lived with Florence and his new family. It appears that the true whereabouts of his death was not made public as it would have caused embarrassment owing to Theresa having been so secretive about the breakdown of her marriage.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Enid had continued to visit her father at his London office, despite being estranged from the rest of her family, and the news must have come as a dreadful shock. However, she did not attend his funeral or even mention his death to the Thompsons. It may be that, having cut herself off from the rest of her family, she did not feel up to dealing with such a difficult and emotional occasion and answering awkward questions from either her family or her employers. Or perhaps her way of coping was to shut away her feelings, as she had been taught to do as a child.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>15. SUCCESS AS A WRITER</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Enid persevered with her writing and, in the early 1920s, began to achieve success. Stories and articles were accepted for publication by various periodicals, including Teacher&#8217;s World, and she also wrote verses for greetings cards. 1922 saw the publication of her first book, Child Whispers, a slim volume of poetry, and in 1923 a couple more books were published as well as over a hundred and twenty shorter pieces\u2014stories, verses, reviews and plays.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>16. MARRIAGE TO HUGH ALEXANDER POLLOCK</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>On 28th August 1924 Enid Blyton married Hugh Alexander Pollock, who was editor of the book department for the publishing firm George Newnes. The two of them had met when Enid was commissioned by Newnes to write a children&#8217;s book about London Zoo\u2014The Zoo Book (1924.) Hugh had been born and brought up in Ayr and had joined the Royal Scots Fusiliers at the beginning of the First World War, being awarded the D.S.O. (Distinguished Service Order) in 1919. His first marriage had ended when his wife had an affair, and he had to obtain a divorce in order to marry Enid.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>The wedding, at Bromley Register Office, was a quiet occasion, with no member of either Enid&#8217;s or Hugh&#8217;s family attending the ceremony. The couple honeymooned in Jersey and Enid was later to base Kirrin in the Famous Five books on an island, castle and village they visited there. After the wedding Enid and Hugh lived first of all in an apartment in Chelsea, moving to their first house, newly-built Elfin Cottage in Beckenham, in 1926.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>17. EARLY WORK AND FIRST NOVEL</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Enid Blyton worked on a number of educational books in the 1920s-30s, among other things, and in 1926 she began writing and editing a fortnightly magazine, Sunny Stories for Little Folks. It became a weekly publication in 1937 and changed its name to Enid Blyton&#8217;s Sunny Stories, finally becoming Sunny Stories. What could be said to be Enid Blyton&#8217;s first full-length novel, The Enid Blyton Book of Bunnies, was published in 1925 (it was later re-titled The Adventures of Binkle and Flip.) However, that book is episodic in nature, reading more like a collection of individual stories about two mischievous rabbits, and The Enid Blyton Book of Brownies, published in 1926, is perhaps more deserving of the title &#8220;first novel.&#8221;</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>In 1927 Hugh persuaded Enid to start using a typewriter. Before that she had written her manuscripts in longhand. Hugh was instrumental in helping his wife establish herself as a writer by publishing her stories at Newnes and, almost certainly, by teaching her about contracts and the business side of her work.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>18. LIFE AT ELFIN COTTAGE</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Hugh and Enid led a quiet and contented life in the early years of their marriage, their leisure time consisting of gardening, occasional outings to the theatre and cinema, and seaside holidays. Hugh indulged his wife&#8217;s playful, childlike side and they would build snowmen together, play &#8220;catch&#8221; and French cricket in the garden, and have games of &#8220;conkers.&#8221;</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>19. OLD THATCH</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>In 1929 they moved to Old Thatch, a sixteenth-century thatched cottage with a lovely garden near the River Thames in Bourne End, Buckinghamshire. Enid described it as being &#8220;like a house in a fairy tale.&#8221; It had once been an inn and Dick Turpin was said to have slept there and stabled his horse, Black Bess, in one of the stables. There was also a tale of treasure hidden on the premises, which has never been found.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>At Old Thatch Hugh and Enid began to have more of a social life, enjoying dinner parties, tennis and bridge. In October 1930 they went on a cruise to Madeira and the Canary Islands aboard the Stella Polaris, the details of which remained vividly in Enid&#8217;s mind, providing her with material for books written years later such as The Pole Star Family and The Ship of Adventure, both published in 1950.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>20. PETS</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>As children, Enid and her brothers had not been allowed to keep pets. Their mother was not fond of animals and their father was worried that cats and dogs might spoil his garden. Enid had once found a stray kitten which she called Chippy and kept secretly for a fortnight, but when her mother found out about it the kitten was sent away. Enid made up for that by having plenty of pets when she was grown-up\u2014dogs, cats, goldfish, hedgehogs, tortoises, fantail pigeons, hens, ducks and many others. One of her most famous pets was Bobs, a fox-terrier. Enid Blyton wrote letters for her Teacher&#8217;s World column about family life as seen through the eyes of Bobs\u2014in fact, she kept on writing these &#8220;Letters from Bobs&#8221; long after the dog had died!</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>21. BIRTH OF GILLIAN AND IMOGEN</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Enid and Hugh had trouble starting a family but eventually, on 15th July 1931, their elder daughter Gillian was born. After a miscarriage in 1934 they went on to have another daughter, Imogen, who was born on 27th October 1935.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>1938 saw the publication of Enid Blyton&#8217;s first full-length adventure book, The Secret Island. She had already written another fairly long adventure story, The Wonderful Adventure, in 1927, but that was really a novella rather than a full-length novel. Enid was by now giving more time than ever to her writing, relying increasingly on domestic staff for housework, gardening and childcare, and she did not have a lot of time to spend with her children. She played with the girls for an hour after tea and sometimes took Imogen out with her to meet Gillian from school. Enid and Hugh no longer had as much time together either. Both were very busy with their work and Hugh, who had been working with Churchill on his writings about the First World War, was falling into depression at the realisation that the world was on the brink of another war. He turned to alcohol for consolation, drinking secretly in a cubby-hole beneath the stairs, while Enid sought solace in her writing and in the close companionship of her friend, Dorothy. Dorothy Richards, a maternity nurse, had come to help out for a few weeks after Imogen was born, and she and Enid had quickly become firm friends. Dorothy, who often came to stay at Old Thatch, was a serene figure who gave Enid a feeling of security at a time when her relationship with Hugh was beginning to disintegrate, and Enid felt that she could rely on her and confide in her.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>22. GREEN HEDGES</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>It was to Dorothy, not Hugh, that Enid turned for help and advice when hunting for a new and larger home, settling on a detached eight-bedroom house, about thirty or so years old, in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire. The house was mock-Tudor in style, with beams and lead-paned windows, and was set in two-and-a-half acres of garden &#8220;with a great many little lawns surrounded by green yew hedges.&#8221; Enid organised the move in August 1938, while Hugh was ill in hospital with pneumonia, and her Sunny Stories readers chose a name for the house\u2014Green Hedges.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>23. DIVORCE OF HUGH AND ENID</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Enid continued writing during the war years. Hugh rejoined his old regiment\u2014the Royal Scots Fusiliers\u2014and was soon posted to Dorking in Surrey to train Home Guard officers. His absence put even more strain on the already fragile marriage and, while on holiday with Dorothy in Devon in the spring of 1941, Enid Blyton met the man who was to become her second husband, surgeon Kenneth Fraser Darrell Waters. Hugh had also become romantically involved with novelist Ida Crowe, and he and Enid were divorced in 1942. Kenneth divorced his wife too, with whom he had had no children.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>24. MARRIAGE TO KENNETH FRASER DARRELL WATERS</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Kenneth and Enid were married at the City of Westminster Register Office on 20th October 1943, six days before Hugh&#8217;s wedding to Ida. Gillian and Imogen had not seen their father since June 1942, when he had left for America to advise on Civil Defence, and sadly they were never to see him again. Although she had promised that Hugh would be free to see his daughters after the divorce, Enid went back on her word and refused to allow him any access at all. She cut her first husband out of her life just as she had done with her mother, perhaps pretending to herself that neither had ever existed. In doing this she was continuing the pattern of behaviour\u2014pretence and denial\u2014that she had learnt in childhood, and making a fiction of her own life. Her autobiography, The Story of My Life (1952), contains photographs of her &#8220;happy little family&#8221;\u2014herself, her second husband Kenneth, Gillian and Imogen. There is no mention of Hugh and, although it is not explicitly stated, readers are given the impression that Kenneth is the girls&#8217; father.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Kenneth, a surgeon, worked at St. Stephen&#8217;s Hospital in Chelsea, London. He was an active man who enjoyed gardening, tennis and golf. While he was serving in the Navy in the First World War, his ship had been torpedoed at the Battle of Jutland, permanently damaging his hearing. As a result, Kenneth found social situations awkward. His deafness made communication difficult, causing him to come across as rude or insensitive at times.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Immensely proud of one another&#8217;s achievements, Enid and Kenneth were very happy although they were bitterly disappointed when, after discovering she was pregnant in the spring of 1945, Enid miscarried five months later, following a fall from a ladder. The baby would have been Kenneth&#8217;s first child and it would also have been the son for which both of them longed.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Kenneth and Enid travelled abroad together only once, in 1948, when they joined friends for a three week semi-business holiday in New York, sailing out on the Queen Elizabeth and back on the Queen Mary. Again, Enid Blyton was to use this experience in a book\u2014The Queen Elizabeth Family, published in 1951. Otherwise, most of their holidays were spent in Dorset where they purchased a golf course and a farm in the 1950s. The farm in Five on Finniston Farm (1960) was inspired by Enid and Kenneth&#8217;s own farm, Manor Farm in Stourton Caundle, while Five Have a Mystery to Solve (1962) is set firmly in a part of Dorset which Enid Blyton loved, with Whispering Island being based on Brownsea Island in Poole Harbour.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>25. MAJOR SERIES AND OTHER WRITING</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Enid Blyton ceased writing her regular column for Teacher&#8217;s World in 1945, after almost twenty-three years, giving her the opportunity to widen the range of her writing activities. Daughters Gillian and Imogen were both at boarding-school and she had begun most of her major series by then including the Secret series, the Famous Five books, the Find-Outers mysteries, the Adventure series, the St. Clare&#8217;s books, the Cherry Tree/Willow Farm series and the Faraway Tree and Wishing Chair books. These were later to be joined by the Secret Seven books, the Barney (or &#8220;R&#8221;) mysteries, the Malory Towers series and the Six Cousins books. Noddy made his first appearance in 1949 and by the mid-fifties there was a huge amount of Noddy-themed merchandise in the shops.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Altogether, Enid Blyton is believed to have written around 700 books (including collections of short stories) as well as magazines, articles and poems. She wrote an incredible variety of books for children aged about two to fourteen\u2014adventure and mystery stories, school stories, circus and farm books, fantasy tales, fairy-tales, family stories, nursery stories, nature books, religious books, animal stories, poetry, plays and songs, as well as re-telling myths, legends and other traditional tales. She earned a fortune from her writing and in 1950 she set up her own limited company, Darrell Waters Ltd., to manage the financial side of things.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>26. ENID BLYTON&#8217;S MAGAZINE</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>In 1952 Enid relinquished Sunny Stories after twenty-six years, launching her fortnightly Enid Blyton&#8217;s Magazine in March 1953. She wrote all the contents herself except for the advertisements, using the magazine to mould her readership through her stories, editorials and news-pages, encouraging her child readers to be kind, helpful and responsible and impressing upon them that, if they used their initiative, they could do their bit and make a difference to society, whatever their age. Through the pages of her magazine she promoted four clubs which children could join\u2014the Busy Bees (which helped animals), the Famous Five Club (which raised money for a children&#8217;s home), the Sunbeam Society (which helped blind children) and the Magazine Club (which raised money for children who had spastic cerebral palsy.) Thousands of readers joined and Enid Blyton spoke proudly of the &#8220;army of children&#8221; who were helping her carry out the work she wanted to do.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Enid Blyton&#8217;s Magazine folded in September 1959 as Enid wished to spend more time with Kenneth, who had retired from his work as a surgeon in 1957. By that time the four clubs had approximately 500,000 members between them and had raised about \u00a335,000 in six years\u2014an enormous amount of money in those days.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>27. FINAL YEARS</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>It was in the late 1950s that Enid Blyton&#8217;s health began to deteriorate. She experienced bouts of breathlessness and had a suspected heart attack. By the early 1960s it was apparent that she was suffering from dementia. Her mind was no longer sharp and she became confused, afflicted by worrying memory lapses and seized by a desire to return to her childhood home in Beckenham with both her parents. Her last two books (excluding reprints of earlier material) were re-tellings of Bible stories, The Man Who Stopped to Help and The Boy Who Came Back, both published in August 1965.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Kenneth was ill too, with severe arthritis. The medicine he took for his arthritis damaged his kidneys and he died on 15th September 1967, leaving Enid a lonely and vulnerable woman. Gillian and Imogen were in their thirties by then, living away from home. They visited regularly and did what they could for their mother but she declined physically and mentally over the next few months, cared for by her staff at Green Hedges. In the late summer of 1968 Enid was admitted to a Hampstead nursing home and, three months later, she died peacefully in her sleep on 28th November 1968, at the age of 71. She was cremated at Golders Green in North London and a memorial service was held for her at St. James&#8217;s Church, Piccadilly, on 3rd January 1969.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>28. HER LEGACY</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Several decades after her death, Enid Blyton is not forgotten. The best of her lives on in her books, many of which are still in print, and she continues to entertain, educate and inspire children around the globe through the words she wrote.

When friends and family gather, many want to commemorate the special day in a unique way.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>At important times like this, how do you know if your gift will communicate your intended wishes? Test your gift ideas against these three questions:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Will this gift serve as a lasting legacy of my hope for this child\u2019s future?</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Does this gift show my support for this child\u2019s spiritual growth?</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Is this gift thoughtful and from my heart?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>If you can say yes to these three questions, your gift will be well received! Here are some ideas to get you started:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>1. Time Capsule \u2013 Fill a lovely tin or box with mementos from the year of the child\u2019s Christening. Add things such as a newspaper page, a church bulletin, the Christening announcement, a photo, a recording of a greeting and a CD of music. Include a note addressed to the child when she is 16 reminding her of your belief in her, or select another age that is meaningful to you. Seal the box and affix a tag saying when it should be opened.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>2. A Gift of Stewardship \u2013 Give a gift of stewardship in a child\u2019s name. Purchase a goat for a South American farm family from Heifer International, and write a note to the parents saying that you hope that as their beautiful child grows, so will the help that this goat offers the needy family. Or \u201cadopt\u201d a child in need of monthly care, and share the photos and letters with the family. Pets are also in need of stewardship: try Bestbuddies.org, as knowing he helped an abandoned puppy will delight a child as he grows.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>3. Promise Bond \u2013 Purchase a savings bond that has an intended goal. Attach a card that says that when it matures, you hope that the recipient is able to use it to participate in a fellowship activity or to attend a special workshop.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>4. Stewardship Savings Account \u2013 Alternatively, start a Stewardship Savings Account for the child with instructions that when she is old enough, she may decide where the funds will be disbursed.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>5. Photo Book \u2013 Make a book on your printer, at a resource such as Lulu.com, or by scrapbooking showing the child their church, congregation and its programs. Feature the child\u2019s family and friends as much as possible so that the child can see their inclusion in the church as a personal story.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>6. Start a Family Heirloom \u2013 Instead of buying a new cross or Bible, consider passing on one that you have treasured so that a tradition can be born.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>7. Christmas Ornament \u2013 Sometimes people don\u2019t think of ornaments if it isn\u2019t Christmas time, but a commemorative ornament is a lovely gift, even in May! Each year when in is put on the tree the child and their parents will be reminded of the special day.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>8. Keepsake Box for the Gown \u2013 Purchase a keepsake storage box and a gift certificate from a dry cleaners so that the parents will be able to easily store the Christening gown.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>9. Christening Family Photos \u2013 If the child was born into a family with siblings or cousins, make a small scrapbook of the family\u2019s other Christening Days, reserving a spot for the baby\u2019s photos. Or for a first child, start an album with the child\u2019s parents\u2019 christening photos.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>and the best gift, you!</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>10. Certificate for an Outing with You \u2013 Make a date with the child in the future, perhaps after their confirmation, or on a certain birthday. Describe where you will take her and how you will describe exactly how she looked (and sounded!) during her christening.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>With a unique, meaningful gift for the child in hand, celebrate this joyous occasion while holding great hope in your heart for the future.</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n", "post_id": 1852, "location": false, "date":

style=\"color:#ff0000;\">The following suggestions can help when your child does not want to go to bed or is having trouble staying in bed:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Maintain structure for bedtime</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Your child will benefit from the structure and rules you set regarding bedtime limitations. In fact, having firm rules can ease \u2013 not cause \u2013 anxiety in children. Make sure you explain the new bedtime rules to your child. When you, the parent and/or guardian, are consistent with the bedtime rules, your child will understand what to expect, learn self-control, and adapt. In fact, they will learn to like the predictability of the sleep routine, but the initial few days need some determination on your part to succeed. It is also very important not to lose ground during holidays and vacations. All adults involved in bedtime routines should agree to act similarly so the child is not confused and learns not to push limits with one or the other adult.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">What should the structure be?</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Establish a set bedtime</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Establish a regular bedtime for your child and be consistent about sending your child to bed at this time. Children with consistent bed times are more likely to get sufficient sleep. If you&#8217;d like to a establish an earlier sleep time than your child current has, you can start setting your child&#8217;s bed time 15 minutes earlier every few nights until you meet your new goal. For example, if your child currently falls asleep at 9:30 p.m. and you would like him or her to go to bed at 8:30, you could start making his or her bedtime 9:15 for a few days, then move it back to 9:00 p.m. This technique is called bedtime fading. Be cautious about moving the bedtime back too quickly or making it too early (for your own convenience) as to make it age inappropriate. Doing so may cause your child to not be able to fall asleep, leading to a lot of frustration. Your child&#8217;s sleep physician may sometimes recommend a late bedtime to begin with and then advise the fading technique. This strategy may reduce stress as you introduce the other quiet activities and routines around bedtime noted below.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Plan up to 1 hour of quiet time before bed for bedtime routines</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Before bedtime every night, set aside up to 1 hour for calm activities, such as listening to quiet music or reading a book in a dim light. The activity should be something that is fun, and that can be used as a tool to create a sense of approaching bedtime. However, the activity should not be too stimulating \u2013 such as TV watching, computer gaming, or heavy homework, which may arouse rather than calm your child. The last several minutes of quiet time activity should take place in the room where your child sleeps.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Activities such as going to the restroom, a relaxing bath, brushing teeth, etc. may be incorporated in this time. Also, it is important for children to be brought to bed/put into bed awake so that they learn to fall asleep by themselves.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">If your child cries, speak calmly, reassure your child &#8220;that he or she is fine and that it is time to go to sleep.&#8221; Make your visit brief, and then leave the room. If your child continues to cry, space out the time between visits to the bedroom, and when you do return, do not do anything but talk calmly, briefly (1-2 minutes), and then leave. No arguments or discussions need to take place. The purpose of your visit is to let your child know that you are present and to reassure him or her that they are okay. Continue to keep the atmosphere as for bed time (dark, quiet, calm). Your child will learn to calm down and go to sleep if you stick with this routine.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">If your child starts developing a habit of getting out of bed, these tips may help resolve this problem. Take your child back to bed, tell him or her that the door will be closed (but not locked) if he or she gets out of bed again and that he or she has control of keeping the door open by staying in bed. If your child stays in bed, the door stays open. If your child gets out of bed, close the door for 1 or 2 minutes. If your child gets out of bed again, put your child back in bed and close the door again for another couple of minutes. Be consistent. You may increase the length of time the door is closed by 1-2 minutes if you do not get a desired response. When your child stays in bed, open the door and acknowledge their good efforts with praise. If age appropriate, a bedtime pass to allow one exit from the bedroom for a specific reason may work as well to give the child a sense of control. For older children, a method of positive reinforcement can be performed, such as praise next morning for staying in bed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">A word on rewards and penalties</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Do praise your child and reward your child when he or she stays in bed or does what you want him or her to do regarding bedtime activities and sleeping. Consider stickers, breakfast treats, small toys, or other special prizes as some possible ways to reward your child. Be careful not to offer junk food as reward. Use positive phrases, such as, &#8220;you are doing a great job of staying in bed.&#8221; On the other hand, don&#8217;t dwell on misbehavior from the previous night. Don&#8217;t use the bedroom as a place of punishment or time outs \u2013 so your child doesn&#8217;t associate the bedroom with negative behavior. Also, don&#8217;t lock your child in his or her bedroom. This again can be considered more of a punishment by a child or can even scare some children.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Patience and persistence</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Changing any habit takes time. Your child will learn new sleep habits if you stick to your prescribed routine. Your child may want to argue or complain about new bedtime rules. You must ignore these arguments and protests. Firmly and calmly let your child know that this is the new bedtime plan. It may be very challenging at first and may take several nights to get your child used to the new plan but with some persistence, you will succeed. Remember, consistency is the key!</span></p>\n", "post_id": 1968, "location": false, "date": "11-21-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["bedtime story", "Richard Scarry", "Good Night", "bedtime rituals", "allaboutmanners animals aviation books breakfast cars children climate cooking dessert FAMILY food frog gaming Gillian Sims good manners health home kids lifestyle literature love manners mental-healt", "Clement Hurd", "Margaret Wise Brown"], "text": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/baby-books.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1974\" alt=\"BABY-BOOKS\" src=\"https://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/baby-books.jpg?w=300&#038;h=166\" width=\"300\" height=\"166\" /></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Reading any book is a soothing way to send your baby off to dreamland \u2014 but stories about going to bed, sleeping, or dreaming are particularly suitable for bedtime, and can even help your child understand and accept bedtime rituals as he gets older. No matter which book you pull out at bedtime, read it in a soothing voice to help calm and reassure your baby.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Here are some of our favorite bedtime books, guaranteed to make at least one of you sleepy:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Good Night, Gorilla, by Peggy Rathmann</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">When the zookeeper makes his nighttime rounds, one mischievous gorilla steals his keys and follows him, releasing the other animals from their cages one by one. Under a moonlit sky, they parade silently behind the sleepy zookeeper and follow him into his house, where the keeper&#8217;s wife discovers them and escorts them back to their beds. Practically wordless, the book tells a delightful going-to-bed story with magical illustrations that will enchant your child.</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Goodnight Moon, by Margaret Wise Brown, illustrated by Clement Hurd</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">For decades children have taken the story of the little rabbit in Goodnight Moon to heart as he performs his evening ritual of saying goodnight to every object in his room, including &#8220;a comb, and a brush, and a bowl full of mush.&#8221; Clement Hurd&#8217;s illustrations start out intensely colored and gradually fade to shades of gray as the bunny grows drowsy. Many parents tell us they depend on this quintessential bedtime book to help their children nod off at night.</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">The Runaway Bunny, by Margaret Wise Brown, illustrated by Clement Hurd</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">When a young bunny threatens to run away and become a rock &#8230; a fish &#8230; a flower &#8230; his mother joins him in his imaginary flight and assures him that she&#8217;ll follow wherever he goes. It&#8217;s a sweet story of the unconditional love of a mother for her child, told in soothing rhythms \u2014 an ideal book for helping your baby go to sleep feeling safe and cared for.</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Hush Little Baby, by Sylvia Long</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">If you don&#8217;t think the classics can be improved on, reading Sylvia Long&#8217;s new edition of &#8220;Hush Little Baby&#8221; may change your mind. Unlike the original song&#8217;s language, which spoke of a mother buying her child all sorts of things to comfort him, this new version emphasizes the beauty and comfort found in the natural world. The familiar bedtime melody will calm and soothe your child, and you&#8217;ll appreciate the book&#8217;s tender, gentle spirit.</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Counting Kisses: A Kiss-and-Read Book, by Karen Katz</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">&#8220;My tired little baby, do you need a kiss?&#8221; From &#8220;ten little kisses on teeny tiny toes&#8221; to &#8220;one last kiss on your sleepy, dreamy head,&#8221; sparse text and winsome illustrations lead you and your baby through a kissing countdown that&#8217;ll soon be a favorite bedtime ritual for you both.</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Snoozers: Seven Short Short Bedtime Stories for Lively Little Kids, by Sandra Boynton</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">The charming Snoozers serves up seven bite-size tales sweetened with humor. Each little story takes a minute or less to read. Colorful tabs help older babies turn the pages themselves. And the wonderfully absurd &#8220;Silly Lullaby&#8221; at the end just might become a family favorite: &#8220;Go to sleep, my zoodle / my fibblety-fitsy foo / Go to sleep, sweet noodle / The owl is whisp&#8217;ring, &#8216;Moo.&#8217;&#8221;</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Good Night, Little Bear, by Patsy Scarry; illustrated by Richard Scarry</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Here&#8217;s a classic Little Golden Book that many moms and dads will remember from childhood. After finishing a bedtime story, Father Bear hoists Little Bear on his shoulders and takes him to bed. In this playful tale of &#8220;Where could Little Bear be?&#8221; Father Bear searches (wink, wink) high and low \u2014 above the china cabinet, under the stove, even in the woodbox outside \u2014 to find him. Little Bear finally reveals himself when they pass a mirror. In a gesture every parent can relate to, Little Bear goes to bed believing he&#8217;s fooled his dad.</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Kitten&#8217;s First Full Moon, by Kevin Henkes</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Simply told and luminously illustrated in black and white with soft shades of gray, this darling story about a kitten who mistakes the moon for a bowl of milk is a comedy of errors.

But how can you ensure your children have a lovely time stuffed with happy memories, without you, their parents, starting the new year in debt and despair?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Here are our seasonal suggestions for cutting costs without anyone noticing.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>1. Make a list.\u00a0Don&#8217;t buy on impulse or just for the sake of it. Those last minute presents are the ones that push your finances into crisis. Leave your credit card at home and take out a specific amount of cash &#8211; then stop.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>2. Make a &#8216;no presents pact&#8217; with family and friends.\u00a0Father Christmas will, of course, come to the little ones, but us adults can probably do without jolly reindeer jumpers and the latest Nigella cookbook. If you think it&#8217;s really sad not to exchange presents, set a price limit, agree a Secret Santa so each person had to buy just one bigger present for a specific person, or insist on something homemade. (Check out our easy and delicious recipe for<a href=\"http://www.parentdish.co.uk/christmas/homemade-chocolates-easy-recipe/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">yummy chocolate truffles</span></a>.)</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>3.\u00a0Use\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.ebay.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">eBay</span></a>.\u00a0One child&#8217;s tat (or at least grown out of) is another, younger child&#8217;s treasure.

Don&#8217;t overbuy food.\u00a0You really don&#8217;t need to have cupboards bulging with chocolates and biscuits and fridges jammed high with cheeses. You&#8217;re shopping for one day, not a siege.

Bulk cook and freeze and menu plan minutely if you are having family to stay. Try and give yourself a meal budget and stick to it.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>10. Food shop with a list.\u00a0Check your cupboards for ingredients before you start, so you don&#8217;t end up doubling up.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>11.\u00a0If you&#8217;re having a large family Christmas,\u00a0share out the cost\u00a0by asking everyone to bring something on the day.

But you don&#8217;t need to be a scrooge to save money in the supermarket &#8211; here are our top 10 tips.\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>1. Make a list\u00a0</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Don&#8217;t spend extra money on the packaging without realising. Go straight to the fruit and veg aisles and choose your own vegetables from the loose items section. It&#8217;ll save you money and take away the tendency to overbuy.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>2. Go to the market\u00a0</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Supermarkets have to pay for electricity, water, building rents etc etc and some of that cost is passed on to shoppers in the price of their products. Market stalls don&#8217;t have to pay those charges so are often a lot cheaper and there are real bargains to be had at the end of the day, so shop late!</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>3. Think about turkey alternatives\u00a0</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>With everyone going mad for turkeys, sales of other meats suffer, so they&#8217;re discounted more regularly.\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.goodtoknow.co.uk/recipes/roast-beef\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Roast beef</span></a>\u00a0is a popular alternative to a\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.goodtoknow.co.uk/recipes/roast-turkey\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">turkey</span></a>\u00a0and chances are you&#8217;ll already have horseradish sauce in your fridge so you won&#8217;t have to splash out on cranberry sauce, stuffing, or other trimmings.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>4. Spread the cost\u00a0</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>If you know you&#8217;re going to need snacks like crisps, nuts, sweets, spirits etc for the relatives, buy some every week. That way you can take advantage of weekly offers in the run-up to Christmas and it means you won&#8217;t have to buy them all at once when they may be full price, just before the big day itself.\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>5. Shop online\u00a0</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Shopping online saves time, money and effort, but it also stops you from impulse buying. In fact, a recent study showed that shopping online could save the average family\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.goodtoknow.co.uk/money/536200/save-160-this-christmas\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">\u00a3160 this Christmas</span></a>. While you&#8217;re going up and down the aisles you&#8217;ll often pick up things that aren&#8217;t on your list just because you like the look of them (supermarkets are designed to make you do just that). Food websites will also try and encourage you to buy extras, but they&#8217;re easier to ignore.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>6. Don&#8217;t overbuy &#8216;just in case&#8217;\u00a0</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Christmas is such a social time and when you have guests you&#8217;ll want to give them food and drink, especially when people pop round. But don&#8217;t forget that chances are you&#8217;ll be going out more than usual too to parties and other social gatherings, so be realistic and think carefully when you&#8217;re buying for guests.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>7. Look out for special drinks deals\u00a0</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Drinks are one thing you can buy in advance as and when you see the deals. Try not to be seduced by posh champagne labels, even if they&#8217;re heavily discounted, supermarket-label wines and champagnes can be just as good and you&#8217;ll save even more money. If you&#8217;re having a party, don&#8217;t buy your Christmas Eve/Day drinks until that&#8217;s out of the way &#8211; you may have enough left over to get you through Christmas without spending any more cash!</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>8. Don&#8217;t buy too big a turkey\u00a0</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>If you do buy one (see tip 3), work out how much turkey you&#8217;ll need for the exact amount of people you&#8217;re feeding so you&#8217;re not eating turkey for the rest of December.\u00a09. Don&#8217;t be sucked in by special offers\u00a0</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Special offers do, of course, save you money, but you often end up buying more items simply because they&#8217;re cheaper than usual. And, in the run-up to Christmas, supermarkets will be filling their stores with bright, cheery decorations, music and money-saving offers to make you spend more. Stay focused and only buy things on special offer you were going to buy anyway.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>10. Buy own-brand\u00a0</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Supermarkets offer their own ranges of popular products at cheaper prices, so think before you reach for branded items. For example, if you&#8217;re buying biscuits to go with your cheese, if you lay them out on a plate and throw away the packaging, none of your guests will know you&#8217;ve bought the cheaper own-brand version.

You can get the new version in Teal, Black, Yellow, Purple, Orange and White. The price for the new version is around $60 although you may have a chance of picking it up a little cheaper online.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>New For early 2013 though are the Furby Party Rockers. There are four new characters and they are smaller than the original Furby. They are set to retail at around $25 so they are far more affordable than the original. The great news is that they also interact with last years version, so if you have one of them you can pair the two together. There are lots of fun and slightly irritating responses programmed in and once again kids are going to love these.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Late summer is when the big new version comes though. This is the Furby Boom and it&#8217;s an exciting new interactive toy that you can use along with an app on any smartphone or tablet. You get your Furby Boom and then match it up on the app and you then have a digital version which you can hatch and then play with. There are lots of toys out there that now have apps and this looks like being one of the better ones. The actual physical toy has LCD eyes which light up and move round. The Furby Boom is going to be sold for around $60, there are some very colourful characters to choose from and they look like being on of the big sellers for Christmas this year.</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<div id=\"mod_23813052\">\n<h2><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>An Interactive Minion</strong></span></h2>\n<div id=\"imgs_23813052\">\n<div id=\"img_url_8295696\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/s1.hubimg.com/u/8295696_f260.jpg\" width=\"260\" height=\"255\" /></strong></span></div>\n<div id=\"img_desc_8295696\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"mod_23813055\">\n<h2><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Get Minions Online</strong></span></h2>\n<div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Despicable-Me-Minion-Stuart-Laughing/dp/B00BSWRWR8%3FSubscriptionId%3D14H876SFAKFS0EHBYQ02%26tag%3Dhubpages0e04-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB00BSWRWR8\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><img alt=\"Despicable Me 2 Minion Stuart Laughing Action Figure\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41KiyrzMqJL._SL75_.jpg\" width=\"75\" height=\"74\" border=\"0\" /></span></a></strong></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Despicable-Me-Minion-Stuart-Laughing/dp/B00BSWRWR8%3FSubscriptionId%3D14H876SFAKFS0EHBYQ02%26tag%3Dhubpages0e04-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB00BSWRWR8\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Despicable Me 2 Minion Stuart Laughing Action Figure</span></a></strong></span>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Amazon Price:\u00a0$34.90</strong></span><br /><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>List Price: $34.99</strong></span></div>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=hubpages0e04-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00BSWRWR8\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" /></strong></span></div>\n<div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Despicable-Me-Buddies-Soft-Huggable-Friends-Minion/dp/B00BSWSD26%3FSubscriptionId%3D14H876SFAKFS0EHBYQ02%26tag%3Dhubpages0e04-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB00BSWSD26\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><img alt=\"Despicable Me 2 Buddies-Soft Huggable Friends-Minion Dave Plush\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51lBZ5YfJWL._SL75_.jpg\" width=\"75\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" /></span></a></strong></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Despicable-Me-Buddies-Soft-Huggable-Friends-Minion/dp/B00BSWSD26%3FSubscriptionId%3D14H876SFAKFS0EHBYQ02%26tag%3Dhubpages0e04-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB00BSWSD26\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Despicable Me 2 Buddies-Soft Huggable Friends-Minion Dave Plush</span></a></strong></span>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Amazon Price:\u00a0$6.99</strong></span></div>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=hubpages0e04-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00BSWSD26\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" /></strong></span></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<div id=\"mod_23813006\">\n<h2><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Get Your Own Minion Army</strong></span></h2>\n<div id=\"txtd_23813006\">\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>One of the films that really caught the imagination of children the world over this summer was Despicable Me 2.

If you turn him upside down you get a funny response and the toy can work out which way around he is facing. There are also different games Elmo will play with you such as playing with frogs or horses. There really is plenty of content programmed into Big Hugs Elmo to keep your child entertained for hours one end. Plus the fact that this is not as expensive as some of the other more hi-tech interactive toys out there. Elmo is aimed at children under the age of 5, although I imagine a few little girls who are a bit older would still love to get a Big Hugs Elmo for Christmas.</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<div id=\"mod_18448324\">\n<h2><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Fijit Friends Shimmies</strong></span></h2>\n<div id=\"imgs_18448324\">\n<div id=\"img_url_8018224\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/s1.hubimg.com/u/8018224_f260.jpg\" width=\"260\" height=\"170\" /></strong></span></div>\n<div id=\"img_desc_8018224\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"mod_19853261\">\n<h2><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Get Shimmies Online</strong></span></h2>\n<div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Fijit-Friends-Shimmies-Spinrose-Figure/dp/B009M2SX9M%3FSubscriptionId%3D14H876SFAKFS0EHBYQ02%26tag%3Dhubpages0e04-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB009M2SX9M\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><img alt=\"Fijit Friends Shimmies Pink Spinrose Figure\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Bxs9yv4cL._SL75_.jpg\" width=\"75\" height=\"59\" border=\"0\" /></span></a></strong></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Fijit-Friends-Shimmies-Spinrose-Figure/dp/B009M2SX9M%3FSubscriptionId%3D14H876SFAKFS0EHBYQ02%26tag%3Dhubpages0e04-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB009M2SX9M\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Fijit Friends Shimmies Pink Spinrose Figure</span></a></strong></span>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Amazon Price:\u00a0$9.99</strong></span><br /><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>List Price: $24.99</strong></span></div>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=hubpages0e04-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B009M2SX9M\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" /></strong></span></div>\n<div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Fijit-Friends-Shimmies-Polka-Figure/dp/B009M2SXDI%3FSubscriptionId%3D14H876SFAKFS0EHBYQ02%26tag%3Dhubpages0e04-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB009M2SXDI\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><img alt=\"Fijit Friends Shimmies Blue Polka Figure\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41pNGXkTWJL._SL75_.jpg\" width=\"75\" height=\"55\" border=\"0\" /></span></a></strong></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Fijit-Friends-Shimmies-Polka-Figure/dp/B009M2SXDI%3FSubscriptionId%3D14H876SFAKFS0EHBYQ02%26tag%3Dhubpages0e04-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB009M2SXDI\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Fijit Friends Shimmies Blue Polka Figure</span></a></strong></span>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Amazon Price:\u00a0$8.50</strong></span><br /><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>List Price: $24.99</strong></span></div>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=hubpages0e04-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B009M2SXDI\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" /></strong></span></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<div id=\"mod_17314549\">\n<h2><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>New Interactive Toys For 2013</strong></span></h2>\n<div id=\"txtd_17314549\">\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Last year Fijit Friends were one of the big sellers.

These are smaller than the original toys but larger than the Newbies. They retail at around $40 and there are going to be four new characters, namely Patter who is pink, Scooch who comes in blue, Skippa in light green and finally Plooki who is purple.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>They have clap sensors which means they will respond in a variety of different ways to different clap patterns. Another excellent feature is that they unlock new content in the original Fijit Friends, content that you would never see unless you get yourself a Yippit. They also have three songs each they will perform and they come with two interactive games. Mattel seem really excited about this new product and when these hit the shops around September we are expecting them to be as popular as the Original Fijit Friends were back in 2011.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Brand new for 2013 are the little Fijit Friends Shimmies. These are the forth generation of the toy and there are three new characters. We have Whirlina, Polka and Spinrose. Once again the toys are interactive and there are various features that you can unlock as you or your child plays with them. They are a whole new set of cute moves these will pull off and we are expecting them to retail at around $20, so far cheaper than the original ones were. It would be no great surprise if Mattel brought out a fifth generation of the Fijits in time for Christmas 2013.</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<div id=\"mod_23666408\">\n<h2><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>VIP Pets</strong></span></h2>\n<div id=\"imgs_23666408\">\n<div id=\"img_url_8254090\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/s3.hubimg.com/u/8254090_f260.jpg\" width=\"260\" height=\"260\" /></strong></span></div>\n<div id=\"img_desc_8254090\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"mod_24577020\">\n<h2><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>VIP Pets Hit The Big Time</strong></span></h2>\n<div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><a href=\"http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?ff3=2&amp;toolid=10044&amp;campid=5336899654&amp;customid=2920911-24577020&amp;lgeo=1&amp;vectorid=229466&amp;item=350931105890\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><img alt=\"Vip Pets Nyla \" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/m/mb7gZ2p-7M6f089KnqoZl2g/140.jpg\" border=\"0\" /></span></a></strong></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><a href=\"http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?ff3=2&amp;toolid=10044&amp;campid=5336899654&amp;customid=2920911-24577020&amp;lgeo=1&amp;vectorid=229466&amp;item=350931105890\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Vip Pets Nyla</span></a></strong></span>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Current Bid:\u00a0$24.01</strong></span></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><a href=\"http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?type=1&amp;campid=5336899654&amp;toolid=10001&amp;customid=2920911-24577020\" target=\"_top\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.awltovhc.com/image-2103840-5902068\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" /></span></a><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/rover.ebay.com/roverimp/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?ff3=10&amp;pub=5574636337&amp;toolid=10001&amp;campid=5336899654&amp;customid=2920911-24577020&amp;uq=VIP+Pets+nyla&amp;mpt=560336805\" /></strong></span></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<div id=\"mod_23666364\">\n<h2><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Say Hello To VIP Pets</strong></span></h2>\n<div id=\"txtd_23666364\">\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>A brand new range of toys that have come over from Spain are the VIP Pets. These cute little puppy characters are made by iMC Toys and they have the potential to be huge. There are six characters being released in the first wave, these are Taylor, Juliet, Gwen, Alex, Nyla and Lady Gigi. Each VIP Pet comes with long bright hair which is perfect for grooming. You get little combs and other tools to groom your pets with. These retail at around $20 so they are not to expensive and they could well be very big over the holidays.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>There are plans to release two more characters later in the year and these will be Tiffany and Lilith, so obviously iMC Toys have faith that these will be very popular. Along with the individual pets you can also buy a pet grooming salon which costs a little more. The appeal of these is just how cute they are and so we think little girls are going to fall in love with the VIP Pets and they could well be the next big thing when it comes to dolls. Initially these were only available in Europe but they have made it over to the US now and look like being big sellers over the next few months. The only slight issue with these is that they can be hard to locate, so if you want to get a head start on VIP Pets we suggesting getting them online sooner rather than later.</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<div id=\"mod_19666685\">\n<h2><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Zoomer The Robot Dog</strong></span></h2>\n<div id=\"imgs_19666685\">\n<div id=\"img_url_8025614\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/s3.hubimg.com/u/8025614_f260.jpg\" width=\"260\" height=\"224\" /></strong></span></div>\n<div id=\"img_desc_8025614\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"mod_24007738\">\n<h2><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Get Zoomer Here</strong></span></h2>\n<div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Zoom-Pets-6020163-Zoomer-Dalmatian/dp/B00DQ9RM2Q%3FSubscriptionId%3D14H876SFAKFS0EHBYQ02%26tag%3Dhubpages0e04-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB00DQ9RM2Q\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><img alt=\"Zoom Pets Zoomer Dalmatian\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41vSZGB%2BzqL._SL160_.jpg\" width=\"160\" height=\"160\" border=\"0\" /></span></a></strong></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Zoom-Pets-6020163-Zoomer-Dalmatian/dp/B00DQ9RM2Q%3FSubscriptionId%3D14H876SFAKFS0EHBYQ02%26tag%3Dhubpages0e04-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB00DQ9RM2Q\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Zoom Pets Zoomer Dalmatian</span></a></strong></span>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Amazon Price:\u00a0$103.76</strong></span></div>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=hubpages0e04-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00DQ9RM2Q\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" /></strong></span></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<div id=\"mod_19666595\">\n<h2><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>More Technical Toys</strong></span></h2>\n<div id=\"txtd_19666595\">\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Last year we tipped\u00a0<a href=\"http://andyoz.hubpages.com/hub/The-Tosy-DiscoRobo-Dancing-Robot-Release-Date-News\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">DiscoRobo</span></a>\u00a0for big things and we were a little disappointed with the results.

They are bringing out Zoomer the Robot Dog. This dog is simply incredible and it interacts with the users much in the same way we see Fijit Friends do. In other words in will respond to certain voice commands such as &#8216;sit&#8217;, &#8216;play dead&#8217; or even &#8216;let&#8217;s play ball&#8217;. Amazingly he can understand English, Spanish and French, so you are not limited to English, you can use other languages as well. The dog runs on four legs and has a remarkable array of movements programmed in. The toy also learns while you interact with it so the more things you say to Zoomer the more content you will unlock.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Zoomer comes with a USB charger so this means you don&#8217;t have to buy new batteries all the time which will save you some money. We are expecting him to go on sale around August time and he will have a retail price of $99.99. So not the cheapest of the interactive toys but certainly one of the most impressive.</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<div id=\"mod_17314560\">\n<h2><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>The New Sphero</strong></span></h2>\n<div id=\"imgs_17314560\">\n<div id=\"img_url_6009318\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/s3.hubimg.com/u/6009318_f260.jpg\" width=\"260\" height=\"235\" /></strong></span></div>\n<div id=\"img_desc_6009318\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"mod_20508014\">\n<h2><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Get The New Sphero</strong></span></h2>\n<div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Sphero-Robotic-Ball-Android-Controlled/dp/B005ONTD42%3FSubscriptionId%3D14H876SFAKFS0EHBYQ02%26tag%3Dhubpages0e04-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB005ONTD42\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><img alt=\"Sphero Robotic Ball - iOS and Android Controlled Gaming System - White\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31I2kEzSSXL._SL160_.jpg\" width=\"160\" height=\"135\" border=\"0\" /></span></a></strong></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Sphero-Robotic-Ball-Android-Controlled/dp/B005ONTD42%3FSubscriptionId%3D14H876SFAKFS0EHBYQ02%26tag%3Dhubpages0e04-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB005ONTD42\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Sphero Robotic Ball &#8211; iOS and Android Controlled Gaming System &#8211; White</span></a></strong></span>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Amazon Price:\u00a0$69.89</strong></span><br /><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>List Price: $129.99</strong></span></div>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=hubpages0e04-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B005ONTD42\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" /></strong></span></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<div id=\"mod_18448266\">\n<div id=\"txtd_18448266\">\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>One exciting new toy that could well be on many older children\u2019s wish list is the Sphero.

It comes with a rubber casing but this can actually be removed so it looks just like a standard Android Tablet. The designers of this have been very smart and given parents plenty of controls over limiting what their children can and can&#8217;t see, so security is a big feature of the Kurio. The product is aimed at children age 5-15 so a large age range. This is by far the best Tablet we have seen for children and it will be retailing at around $200 and be available around September.</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<div id=\"mod_24414519\">\n<h2><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>The New Version For 2013</strong></span></h2>\n<div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/LeapFrog-LeapPad-Ultra-Learning-Tablet/dp/B00CS1WDBI%3FSubscriptionId%3D14H876SFAKFS0EHBYQ02%26tag%3Dhubpages0e04-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB00CS1WDBI\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><img alt=\"LeapFrog LeapPad Ultra Kids' Learning Tablet, Green\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51F5va2zM7L._SL160_.jpg\" width=\"160\" height=\"160\" border=\"0\" /></span></a></strong></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/LeapFrog-LeapPad-Ultra-Learning-Tablet/dp/B00CS1WDBI%3FSubscriptionId%3D14H876SFAKFS0EHBYQ02%26tag%3Dhubpages0e04-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB00CS1WDBI\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">LeapFrog LeapPad Ultra Kids&#8217; Learning Tablet, Green</span></a></strong></span>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Amazon Price:\u00a0$140.00</strong></span><br /><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>List Price: $149.99</strong></span></div>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=hubpages0e04-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00CS1WDBI\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" /></strong></span></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<div id=\"mod_24414497\">\n<h2><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>LeapFrog LeapPad Ultra</strong></span></h2>\n<div id=\"txtd_24414497\">\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Despite the original version of the LeapFrog LeapPad not doing as well as many had thought the makers of this have not given up quite yet.

These are life like animals that respond to touch, sound and movement. The company behind Furreal Friends are Hasbro and over the years they have brought out many classic toys. Last year one of the most popular ones was\u00a0<a href=\"http://andyoz.hubpages.com/hub/Baby-Butterscotch-Pony-Furreal-Friends-Release-Date-Prices-Buy-Online\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Baby Butterscotch Pony</span></a>. This is a smaller version of the classic Butterscotch Pony which came out back in 2006. Another great looking toy from Furreal Friends was Bouncy, My\u00a0<a href=\"http://andyoz.hubpages.com/hub/Furreal-Friends-Bouncy-My-Happy-To-See-Me-Pup-Release-Date-Prices\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Happy To See Me Pup</span></a>. This adorable little toy has a movement sensor so when you approach it will start jumping all over the place and barking with giddy excitement. This was another big seller back in 2012 and it should still be quite popular moving into this year.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>It comes as no surprise that Hasbro are releasing yet more Furreal Friends in time for Christmas 2013. The most impressive of these looks like being Cuddles, My Giggly Monkey. Cuddles will cling onto you and move her head back and forwards. She also has various different responses to touch and she has lots of different movements she is capable of. This one is set for release sometime in the fall and it is going to retail at around $80, this makes Cuddles the most expensive of the new releases from Furreal.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Our personal favourite for release this year is Trixie, The Skateboarding Pup. Also due for release in the fall Trixie is one of the most lively creations we have seen from Hasbro. You place her on her skateboard and then drive her round using the simple yet brilliant little remote control. The speed and movement you can get from this is very impressive and great fun for kids young and old. Take Trixie off her board and she has moveable feet, ears and head. While she is moving around she yaps excitedly and makes sounds that would put a smile on almost anyone&#8217;s face. This one will retail at around $40 and we are expecting this one to be the big seller for Furreal come holiday season.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Next up is Daisy, Plays With Me Kitty. She is an adorable little kitten that is very interactive. She has several touch sensors located on places such as head, back and paws. She has the ability to stand up on her back legs, jump around or simply walk around. As you would expect there are also lots of sounds that Daisy makes including a very cute purr. This is a little more basic than the other two releases but still highly impressive. We are expecting Daisy to start showing up in the fall and have a price of around $45.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>In the spring Hasbro also brought out lots of new smaller pets including some new Feed Me Babies, these come in the form of little bears that you can feed with a bottle and they make sounds like they are drinking. These cost around $15 and are out now. There were also Dress Me Babies which included bunnies, cats and puppies, all these were quite cheap to buy as well at around $15. You also have the Walkin&#8217; Ponies which came out in the spring, these are very cute and walk around very well, plus they make some adorable little sounds, these cost $20. Plus of course Hasbro has added to their massive line of little snuggimals which are very cute and only cost around $10, so they are quite easy to collect. So as you can see, plenty of\u00a0<a href=\"http://andyoz.hubpages.com/hub/New-Furreal-Friends-Pets-For-Christmas-2012\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">new Furreal Friends pets</span></a>\u00a0which are sure to be very popular come the end of the year.</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"mod_17314531\">\n<h2><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>The Hobbit Toys</strong></span></h2>\n<div id=\"txtd_17314531\">\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Last year the Hobbit movie was simply huge and there were lots of toys and games brought out to coincide with this.

These first started showing up in September and you can now buy 6 inch figures of characters such as Gandalf, Bilbo, Thorin. There are also 3.75 inch figures available and these include version of the dwarves, Bilbo and you can even get a Gollum figure. If you want some more gruesome characters then you can get the Goblin King in a twin pack with Thorin, you can get Grinnah who is the second in command of the Goblin army or you can get Bolg who is the leader of the Orcs and comes in a twin pack with Gandalf. These are also likely to be big sellers come the end of the year as hype surrounding the release of the movie starts to increase.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<div id=\"mod_20236068\">\n<h2><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Spider-Man Web Shooting Figure</strong></span></h2>\n<div id=\"imgs_20236068\">\n<div id=\"img_url_7050668\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/s1.hubimg.com/u/7050668_f260.jpg\" width=\"260\" height=\"260\" /></strong></span></div>\n<div id=\"img_desc_7050668\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"mod_20262223\">\n<div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Batman-Dark-Knight-Rises-Vehicle/dp/B006O6FK2W%3FSubscriptionId%3D14H876SFAKFS0EHBYQ02%26tag%3Dhubpages0e04-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB006O6FK2W\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><img alt=\"Batman The Dark Knight Rises The Bat Vehicle\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41d0do2JoWL._SL75_.jpg\" width=\"75\" height=\"56\" border=\"0\" /></span></a></strong></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Batman-Dark-Knight-Rises-Vehicle/dp/B006O6FK2W%3FSubscriptionId%3D14H876SFAKFS0EHBYQ02%26tag%3Dhubpages0e04-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB006O6FK2W\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Batman The Dark Knight Rises The Bat Vehicle</span></a></strong></span>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Amazon Price:\u00a0$10.00</strong></span><br /><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>List Price: $31.99</strong></span></div>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=hubpages0e04-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B006O6FK2W\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" /></strong></span></div>\n<div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Amazing-Spider-Man-Deluxe-Rapid-Fire-Shooter/dp/B0085K1P06%3FSubscriptionId%3D14H876SFAKFS0EHBYQ02%26tag%3Dhubpages0e04-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB0085K1P06\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><img alt=\"The Amazing Spider-Man Deluxe Rapid-Fire Web Shooter Pack\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41jYRRmtH8L._SL75_.jpg\" width=\"75\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" /></span></a></strong></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Amazing-Spider-Man-Deluxe-Rapid-Fire-Shooter/dp/B0085K1P06%3FSubscriptionId%3D14H876SFAKFS0EHBYQ02%26tag%3Dhubpages0e04-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB0085K1P06\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">The Amazing Spider-Man Deluxe Rapid-Fire Web Shooter Pack</span></a></strong></span>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Amazon Price:\u00a0$22.99</strong></span><br /><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>List Price: $32.99</strong></span></div>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=hubpages0e04-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B0085K1P06\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" /></strong></span></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<div id=\"mod_20236017\">\n<h2><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Super Hero Toys</strong></span></h2>\n<div id=\"txtd_20236017\">\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>As you are no doubt aware the Super Hero craze has really taken off in the past few years. Marvel Comics and DC are battling it out on the big screen bringing out massive films such as The Avengers, Spiderman, The Dark Knights Rises and more. This year we have had Man of Steel and the new Iron Man 3 movie so it comes as no great surprise that currently Super Hero toys are very popular.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>One we are expecting to do well is the Spider-Man Web Shooting figure. This stands around 13 inches tall and has a mechanism that shoots out a chord from each hand. There are buttons on the back to control the shooters and they look really impressive. With a reasonably modest retail price of around $35 this could be a very popular Spider-Man figure. Another one based on a recent movie is the Batman The Dark Knight Rises Bat Vehicle. This comes with a vehicle that we see in the movie and it also has a Batman figure which it shoots out into the air. This retails at around $30.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Not exactly a super hero but not far off is of course James Bond. With the release of Skyfall and the fact that it looks like being one of the biggest box office hits of all time, demand for toys based on Bond is certainly another area to look at. There are little cars for sale based on the classic Aston Martin and other James Bond cars, there are spy kits that could end up being very popular and of course there are all the old movies and books you can buy. These may not be ideal for younger children but as kids start getting a little older they should start to appeal.</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<div id=\"mod_17314561\">\n<div id=\"imgs_17314561\">\n<div id=\"img_url_6009319\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/s4.hubimg.com/u/6009319_f260.jpg\" width=\"260\" height=\"213\" /></strong></span></div>\n<div id=\"img_desc_6009319\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"mod_24092615\">\n<h2><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Lego Minifigures Series 11</strong></span></h2>\n<div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><a href=\"http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?ff3=2&amp;toolid=10044&amp;campid=5336899654&amp;customid=2920911-24092615&amp;lgeo=1&amp;vectorid=229466&amp;item=151149612145\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><img alt=\"\u26055 x LEGO Minifigures Series11 collectible Mystery Bags Gift Pack 71002 TOYS NEW\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/m/m4_sGIy2ktWdbFiGwjnj1dQ/140.jpg\" border=\"0\" /></span></a></strong></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><a href=\"http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?ff3=2&amp;toolid=10044&amp;campid=5336899654&amp;customid=2920911-24092615&amp;lgeo=1&amp;vectorid=229466&amp;item=151149612145\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">\u26055 x LEGO Minifigures Series11 collectible Mystery Bags Gift Pack 71002 TOYS NEW</span></a></strong></span>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Current Bid:\u00a0$22.88</strong></span></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><a href=\"http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?type=1&amp;campid=5336899654&amp;toolid=10001&amp;customid=2920911-24092615\" target=\"_top\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.awltovhc.com/image-2103840-5902068\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" /></span></a><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/rover.ebay.com/roverimp/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?ff3=10&amp;pub=5574636337&amp;toolid=10001&amp;campid=5336899654&amp;customid=2920911-24092615&amp;uq=Lego+Minifigures+Series+11+Mystery+Bag&amp;mpt=560336805\" /></strong></span></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<div id=\"mod_17314552\">\n<h2><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>The Classic Toys</strong></span></h2>\n<div id=\"txtd_17314552\">\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Every year we see more new releases from classic toys that have been going for years. One of the most obvious of these is one we have already mentioned, Lego. In 2012 Lego released their<a href=\"http://andyoz.hubpages.com/hub/Buy-Lego-Superheroes-Sets-2012-Online-DC-Universe-Minifigures\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Superheroes range</span></a>, a line of toys based on Marvel Comics and also the DC Universe. These toys were very popular when released and we expect more new sets based on Superman and Iron Man 3 to be coming out in 2013. There are also lots of other popular Lego themes and the company will be releasing plenty of new toys just in time for the holidays.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>When it comes to little stocking fillers then Lego Minifigures can be perfect. These retail at just $3 each and they are very collectable. The latest series of Minifigures is\u00a0<a href=\"http://andyoz.hubpages.com/hub/Lego-Minifigures-Series-11-Release-Date-Bump-Dot-Codes\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Series 11</span></a>, these came out early September and are once again very popular. The next release, Series 12 is coming out early January and this is likely to feature characters from the new Lego Movie coming out early in 2014.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Over the past few years one of the biggest lines Lego have been bringing out is the Star Wars theme. We have seen some brilliant new sets released in recent years and 2013 has been no exception. Star Wars Lego is once again expected to be very popular over the holiday season. Some of the new sets we have seen this year include Jabba&#8217;s Palace, a large Malevolence set, a new version of the Gungan Sub, a Sith Fury-Class Interceptor, a new Republican Star Fighter and a Desert Skiff. All these sets come in various shapes and sizes and range in price from quite low to high. The latest new release from the Star Wars line is a special collectors edition of the classic B-Wing which comes out in October. This has a huge 1486 pieces and so is one of the biggest Star Wars toys ever released by Lego. if you want something that little bit special then this certainly is one worth taking a look at.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>One of the all time classic toys for girls is of course Barbie. In 2012 we are seeing a new take on the doll, we are going to be seeing\u00a0<a href=\"http://minimimi.hubpages.com/hub/BarbiePhotoFashionDollReleaseDateAndBuyOnline\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Barbie Photo Fashion Doll</span></a>\u00a0hit the shops. This is basically a normal barbie doll but with a little camera installed. There is a display on Barbie&#8217;s front and when you take a picture you can save this and then Barbie effectively wears your picture. There are well disguised buttons and controls and you can also download the pictures or even upload ones onto Barbie. The camera is an impressive 5 Mega Pixels and you can actually store up to 100 photos. This looks like a really nice take on what is a classic toy. Barbie Photo Fashion Doll will retail at around the $50 and we are expecting her to be available around September time, just in time for the Christmas rush.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Another product that is like a modern day Barbie are the\u00a0<a href=\"http://andyoz.hubpages.com/hub/The-Monster-High-Characters-Complete-Doll-Listing\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Monster High dolls</span></a>.

The company behind Twister have managed to get Britney Spears on board to help promote this new toy, so we are expecting it to be huge later in the year.

In February there was a massive Toy Fair and this gave us some clues as to what to expect over the coming year. The real buzz seems to be around the interactive toys that incorporate technology along with classic kids design, but we have also seen some more classic design toys as well. As more toys start to appear we will update this page throughout the year giving you an idea of some of the best toys for Christmas 2013.</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</article>\n</div>\n", "post_id": 2000, "location": false, "date": "11-26-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Geoffrey Parker Scrabble", "Graf von Faber-Castell", "RICH KIDS", "allaboutmanners animals aviation books breakfast cars children climate cooking dessert FAMILY food frog gaming Gillian Sims good manners health home kids lifestyle literature love manners mental-healt", "Kristal Champagne", "coffee beans", "solid gold pen", "sterling silver", "CHRISTMAS"], "text": "<h1 style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>The world&#8217;s most expensive gifts: From the glass pool table to the \u00a33,400 coffee beans, what the really rich will get this Christmas</strong></span></h1>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>While most of us will be happy with a DVD, t-shirt or perhaps a nice new watch from our loved ones this year, the uber-rich will be expecting a little bit more as they unwrap their presents while sipping Kristal Champagne in front of the Queen&#8217;s Speech.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>&#8216;If in doubt, sprinkle it in diamonds&#8217; appears to be the rallying call of the upmarket manufacturers and boutiques catering to the whims of the international jet set this Christmas.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>From a \u00a320,000 bejewelled USB stick (perfect for the billionaire tech genius in your life), to a solid gold pen that comes with an eye-watering \u00a360,000 price tag, MailOnline takes a peek under the wrapping paper of the one per cent.</strong></span></p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><img alt=\"Scrabble\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/12/20/article-0-165D17E1000005DC-231_634x444.jpg\" width=\"634\" height=\"444\" /></strong></span><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Fine words: How many points in the word \u2018luxury\u2019?

It will allow you to teach them values without being &#8220;preachy&#8221; and will create memories your grandchildren will remember all of their life.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Try to match the craft activity to one that the child is interested in. As a grandmother, I have used holidays and important family dates to participate in a craft with my granddaughters. I always help them make a Christmas gift and a Mother&#8217;s Day/Father&#8217;s Day gift for Mom and Dad. And birthdays are never forgotten. Not only do we enjoy spending the time together, but also they are so excited to be able to give a gift that they have actually created. We have great fun putting together &#8220;beautiful&#8221; cards with construction paper, glitter, buttons, feathers, ribbon, etc. Sometimes we find pictures on the Internet that can be used. Sometimes the girls know more about how to find them than Mimi does. One of the most fun crafts we did was for Mother&#8217;s Day this year. Their mother&#8217;s favorite craft is cross-stitch. Now one of her most treasured keepsakes is the plastic grid that her six year old worked on for several weeks in order to create a &#8220;beautiful&#8221; cross-stitch butterfly. It is important to keep the craft age appropriate and not to expect that the end result be perfect. The kit we used was one that is inexpensive and can be bought anywhere sewing crafts are sold. The four year old was also excited to give her Mom a &#8220;sewing&#8221; project. I used colored craft foam and cut out a large heart. Holes were punched along the edge and my granddaughter used a plastic needle to lace plastic &#8220;thread&#8221; through the holes. It is now also one of her Mom&#8217;s most valuable treasures.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>One of the important concepts communicated to the child when I help them with a gift for their parents, is that I value their parents. Two of my granddaughters are now six and four years old, and they are aware that their father is my son. I use this as an opportunity to speak to them about families and how they love and care for each other. When we make a gift for their mother I make sure they know that I also value and appreciate her and consider her to be a good mother. </strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>My husband also uses crafts and games to bond with the girls. One of the most fun activities was the time he helped them to make wooden boats with sails and then both families (along with their eighty three year old great grandmother) went down to the neighborhood pond and floated the boats. It was a great bonding experience for the whole family and the girls still talk about the memory that was created. A little different spin on the craft idea for my husband is his cache of child friendly toys. He is always finding something unusual, a lot of times something that was more popular in a bygone era. An example is a set of pick-up sticks. It was a big hit and something the children have enjoyed doing with &#8220;Pa&#8221;.

There\u2019s an app for that. A new video chat app called \u201c<a href=\"https://sayhellosanta.com/\">Hello Santa</a>\u201d offers you and your child a one-on-one with the jolly ol\u2019 elf himself, and for once, it\u2019s not a pre-recorded video. For those who are sick of standing in half-hour or longer lines only to have their kid freeze up, balk or cry when it\u2019s finally their turn to sit on Santa\u2019s knee, Hello Santa can be a great alternative. There\u2019s no time limit on the call itself, allowing mom and/or dad a chance to aid in conversation, instead of shouting at their kid from next to the elf manning Santa\u2019s photography station.</p>\n\n<p>This live visit from Santa does not come cheap, however, as some early, frustrated App Store reviews point out. \u201c$14.99 a call not worth it,\u201d writes someone who signed their review \u201cDon\u2019t waste your time\u2026\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I think that\u2019s\u2026</p>\n</div><p class=\"reblog-source\"><a

encouraged to create, draw, color, paint and build. These activities can certainly stimulate children, and help them grow. Very often, these masterpieces that your children create are brought home and proudly displayed. But what do you do when all of the artwork begins to take over your home? Here are 7 great ideas: 1. FIND THE DIAMONDS. Rather than keeping every single piece of artwork your child creates, sit down with your child on a regular basis and ask him to choose the one or two he likes best. By the end of the year, you should have no more than 5 pieces of artwork that your child believes to be his best pieces. This will help keep the artwork under control, and will still give you an opportunity to save his creations for future memories. 2. A PICTURE IS WORTH A THOUSAND WORDS. Take photos\u2026</p>\n</div><p class=\"reblog-source\"><a href=\"http://babychildrenparents.wordpress.com/2013/12/01/7-easy-ideas-for-organizing-kids-artwork/\">View original</a> <span class=\"more-words\">356 more words</span></p></div></div>", "post_id": 2019, "location": false, "date": "12-01-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "", "post_id": 2020, "location": false, "date": "12-01-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<div class=\"wpcom-reblog-snapshot\"> <div class=\"reblog-post\"><p class=\"reblog-from\"><img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b8835d6367cb2f0dd3042a209d254a37?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />Originally posted on <a href=\"http://nenablogs.wordpress.com/2013/12/01/25-children-activities/\">nenablogs247</a>:</p><div class=\"reblogged-content\">\n<p>Hey everyone!

There are a number of causes for this type of reaction, which will be discussed along with everything else you need to know about Christmas tree allergies.</strong></span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>REAL VERSUS FAKE CHRISTMAS TREES</strong></span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Trying to decide which type of tree to get can be difficult, and it will vary based on personal preference. Each type of tree, both real and fake can aggravate allergies; it just depends upon what the individual person is\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.symptomfind.com/diseases-conditions/allergies/\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">allergic</span></a>\u00a0to.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>To many people, there is nothing better than a real Christmas tree. It just captures the essence of Christmas, right down to the very scent that fills the home. However, real Christmas trees are full of different allergens. The species of tree that are used for Christmas trees contain terpenes, which have been shown to cause allergic reactions in some people. These are the compounds that give the pine trees their smell, and because of their chemical characteristics, they are often used in perfumes, cleaning supplies and solvents. These terpenes occur naturally in the tree and people are exposed to them when brought into an enclosed space, or if they touch the tree.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Even if terpenes aren&#8217;t the culprit for allergies on a real Christmas tree,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.symptomfind.com/diseases-conditions/mold-allergies/\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">mold</span></a>\u00a0or pollen might be. Since Christmas trees grow outside, they are exposed to all the allergens found outdoors. When people bring trees inside, they also bring in things like mold and pollen, which are extremely common allergens. \u00a0According to an article in U.S. News and World Report, when people brought Christmas trees indoors, the mold spore count in the home increased fivefold.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Unfortunately, artificial trees also contain their share of allergens. They too can harbor mold and dust after being stored in attics or damp basements all year long. They can also contain bugs and their droppings, which are also a common source of allergy irritation. In addition to this, the material that the tree is made from can be a source of the allergens. Certain plastics release chemicals into the air that can cause allergy symptoms. Any tree that has been flocked will cause allergy symptoms as well because the material used can irritate allergies.</strong></span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>REDUCING ALLERGENS</strong></span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>There are some ways to reduce the allergens associated with Christmas trees. If a real tree is chosen, the tree should be cleaned thoroughly before bringing it into the home. There are a number of ways to do this.</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>First, the tree should be shaken out outdoors to remove any loose debris.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Next a leaf blower or shop vacuum can be used to remove as many of the spores and particles.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>The tree can also be washed in a solution of water and a small amount of bleach. The bleach will kill any mold present without hurting the tree and the water will wash away any dust and debris.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Artificial trees can be vacuumed and washed as well, but since the trees usually contain metal parts they should be dried well to prevent rust.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>When storing artificial trees, they should be sealed inside a plastic bag and then placed in a plastic storage box. Cardboard boxes or bags let dust and bugs get into the tree.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Artificial trees should always be opened outside after being stored all year.</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Of course, there are other Christmas tree alternatives that may provide relief from allergens. These include the Christmas tree made from soda cans, wood or a variety of other materials. They are also environmentally friendly because they can be recycled.</strong></span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>TREATMENT OPTIONS</strong></span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>The most important thing that people can do to reduce allergy symptoms during Christmas is to make sure their tree is free from as many allergens as possible. Here is a list of treatment options that can be implemented to alleviate Christmas tree allergies:</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Treatment will vary based upon individual symptoms. Most of the time, an antihistamine allergy medication will do the best job, but they can cause drowsiness. There are some non-drowsy allergy medications that could help as well.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>If over-the-counter medications are not effective, there are a number of prescription medications that can help.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>If Christmas tree allergies are also an asthma trigger, it&#8217;s important that those who suffer from asthma consult with their doctors to be sure that they have the medication that they need to keep asthma symptoms under control. This will often include daily maintenance medication such as steroid inhalers as well as acute asthma treatments like rescue inhalers.</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>WARNING SIGNS</strong></span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>While most allergy symptoms are less than pleasant, they are typically not life threatening. If someone experiences a severe reaction, medical attention must be sought immediately. Signs of a life threatening reaction include swelling of the throat or tongue, difficulty breathing or a rash.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Christmas trees can be a source of allergy irritation, but they don&#8217;t have to be. While it&#8217;s impossible to remove all allergens, you can follow the tips provided here to reduce the amount of allergens that need to be dealt with meaning that people can keep the Christmas tree without having to worry too much about allergy symptoms.</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n", "post_id": 2025, "location": false, "date": "12-02-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["allaboutmanners animals aviation books breakfast cars children climate cooking dessert FAMILY food frog gaming Gillian Sims good manners health home kids lifestyle literature love manners mental-healt"], "text": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://wordpress.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/achievements/anniversary-1x.png\" width=\"128\" height=\"128\" /></strong></span></div>\n<div>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>You registered on WordPress.com 2 years ago!</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Thanks for flying with us.

Look ahead when you walk and extend your arms out to your sides to maintain balance. Wear warm gloves so you can keep your hands out of your pockets. That way, you can use your hands to break your fall if you do slip. It also helps to stop occasionally to break your momentum.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>If you must carry a load, try not to carry too much, or carry it in a backpack. It&#8217;s best to leave your hands and arms free to balance yourself.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>In cold temperatures, assume all wet, dark areas on pavements are slippery and icy.

The polite way to open presents is to do so one at a time, with attention paid to each gift and a thank you delivered each time. But that can be easier said than done. Here\u2019s how to help your kid\u2019s do Christmas day the polite way.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><b>Talk about it beforehand.\u00a0</b>Before the big day have a powwow with the kids. Senning suggests something along the lines of \u201cChristmas morning last year got really crazy, so let\u2019s see if we can do it a different way. Let\u2019s think of a way we can do that.\u201d That way the child is engaged in the gift opening procedure and has a bit of ownership about it. If they feel they are a part of the new rule system, they\u2019re more likely to follow it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><b>Develop a pattern.\u00a0</b>Have present opening occur in a clockwise manner or by age so that everyone knows when their turn is. Stick to the order too.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><b>Have the kids involved in picking presents.</b>\u00a0Instead of having the children pick the present they want to open, have them pick something from under the tree for mom or dad to unwrap.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><b>Stay engaged in the process.</b>\u00a0Feel free to prompt the kids along to pick out a gift or to pay attention as their sibling opens theirs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><b>Use positive reinforcement.</b>\u00a0Once so and so has opened their present (preferably in a manner that does not resemble the Hulk), let them know how good they were at doing that.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><b>Do stockings before the big present opening.\u00a0</b>Growing up, Senning always woke up Christmas morning to her stocking at the foot of her bed. \u201cThe stockings were the thing that kept us going until it was time to go downstairs,\u201d she said. Having stockings in the a.m. can help cool the crazy for a bit, giving you time to wake up properly before tackling Operation Present Opening. \u0090</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><b>THE BIG MEAL</b></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">At some point during the holiday season, there will be a big sit-down meal. This can be a moment where your child can shine \u2014 or really, really falter. Here\u2019s some basic tips on how to civilize your kid in time for the big feast.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><b>Practice, practice, practice.\u00a0</b>\u201cYou would not send a 6-year-old to play in a soccer tournament without them having practiced with some of the skills of playing soccer,\u201d Senning said. \u201cWell, I think of the holiday dinner like that. It\u2019s the tournament of mealtime.\u201d So have your child practice their manners at home, before they\u2019re unleashed at the Christmas feast.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><b>Pick three manners to focus on.\u00a0</b>Senning recommends having a few dinners before the holiday meal in which you focus on a few specific manners rules \u2014 such as chewing with the mouth closed, using the correct silverware or asking for things to be passed rather than reaching for them. Focusing on a few specific manners will help your child absorb the information better rather than throwing it at them all at once.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><b>Solve the chewing problem.</b>\u00a0It\u2019s one of the biggest eating faux pas \u2014 chewing with your mouth open. And kids love to do it. Senning suggests fixing that by using these tactics:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">1. Describe eating as a gross activity. \u201cKid\u2019s really don\u2019t like to be gross,\u201d Senning said. \u201cWell, maybe with their friends. But generally speaking, kid\u2019s like to be liked and to be attractive.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">2. Put a mirror in front of them so they can see exactly what they look like when they chew with their mouth open. \u201cIt works very well,\u201d she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><b>Establish why manners are important.</b>\u00a0\u201c[Manners] really are either to keep us from grossing each other out at the table or to keep us from embarrassing ourselves,\u201d that\u2019s what Senning explains at her child etiquette courses. \u201cThe big thing I found with teaching kids manners is trying to make it relevant, showing them how it fits into their lives,\u201d Senning said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><b>Keep at it.</b>\u00a0It can take awhile before rules sink in \u2014 so prepare for a long haul of a battle. Feel free to start small, but just stay on message and repeat the rules.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><b>Use the golden rule.</b>\u00a0Sometimes kids need additional prodding to realize why they should use manners. Senning recommends doing a bit of role play in which you talk to your child about how they feel when people do or don\u2019t do something, like saying thank you. Once they realize that they feel bad when people don\u2019t thank them for something, they\u2019ll then see the importance in saying thank you so others don\u2019t feel the same way. It\u2019s the whole \u2018do unto others as you would have them do unto you\u2019 thing. \u0090</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><b><a href=\"http://blog.pennlive.com/life/2012/12/table_manners_101_dos_and_dont.html\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">(The biggest do&#8217;s and don&#8217;ts of table manners &#8211; for kids)</span></a></b></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><b>THE AFTERMATH</b></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">The presents have been opened and the family has gorged itself on a Christmas turkey or ham. Now comes the time for thank you notes.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">\u201cThank you notes are a big issue,\u201d Senning said. With that in mind, here are the rules for gratitude.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><b>Notes are unnecessary if you thank someone in person.\u00a0</b>\u201cIf the thank you\u2019s are given personally and with some sense of enthusiasm, that\u2019s the nicest thank you of all,\u201d Senning said. \u201cIf you look at Emily [Post\u2019s] old books, it\u2019ll say the best thank you is when you talk to the person.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><b>The jury is out on Skype thank yous.\u00a0</b>Let\u2019s say you Skyped Grandma in on Christmas Day to watch your child open a present, and then had your kid say thank you on camera. While that could count as an in person thank you, Senning suggests writing a thank you note as well. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt to write a thank you note anyway,\u201d she said. Senning suggests including something like \u2018It was so much fun to have you with us on Skype\u2019 in the note.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><b>You must send one in all other cases \u2014 and soon.\u00a0</b>\u201cOne of the things I suggest to parents is that they establish a pattern, a tradition, a routine of doing thank you notes two days after Christmas,\u201d Senning said. That goes for parents too. Have the entire family sit down for one giant than you note writing affair.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><b>Get young kids involved.</b>\u00a0If little Suzy is too young to write, do the thank you note for her. But keep her involved. \u201cAsk them what their favorite thing about the gift was and then you write that,\u201d Senning said. Then turn the card over to the child to decorate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><b>Keep it short, sweet and to the point.</b>\u00a0Thank you notes don\u2019t have to be long winded affairs. \u201cPeople only need to write a couple sentences,\u201d Senning said. \u201cIt\u2019s literally a note expressing appreciation for a gift received.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><b>Give the gift of stationery.\u00a0</b>Need help on getting your kids excited about thank you notes? Have one of their presents be a cute, funky stationery set. That way you are giving them an opportunity to use something new \u2014 it\u2019ll help you generate a bit of enthusiasm.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><b>Toss in a photo.\u00a0</b>Snap a shot of the child with the present to include in the thank you note. \u201cIt\u2019s a really nice addition to our ability to say thanks,\u201d</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n", "post_id": 2042, "location": false, "date": "12-07-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["allaboutmanners animals aviation books breakfast cars children climate cooking dessert FAMILY food frog gaming Gillian Sims good manners health home kids lifestyle literature love manners mental-healt", "CHRISTMAS"], "text": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/miss.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2046\" alt=\"miss\" src=\"https://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/miss.jpg?w=275&#038;h=183\" width=\"275\" height=\"183\" /></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Sitting under the mistletoe</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">(Pale green, fairy mistletoe),</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">One last candle burning low,</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">All the sleepy dancers gone,</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Just one candle burning on,</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Shadows lurking everywhere:</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Someone came, and kissed me there.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Tired I was; my head would go</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Nodding under the mistletoe</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">(Pale green, fairy mistletoe)</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">No footsteps came, no voice, but only,</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Just as I sat there, sleepy, lonely,</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Stooped in the still and shadowy air</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Lips unseen &#8211; and kissed me there.</span></p>\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">\u00a0</span></p>\n", "post_id": 2045, "location": false, "date": "12-07-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["allaboutmanners animals aviation books breakfast cars children climate cooking dessert FAMILY food frog gaming Gillian Sims good manners health home kids lifestyle literature love manners mental-healt", "mistletoe", "trees and shrubs", "sticky juice", "CHRISTMAS"], "text": "<h1></h1>\n<p>Most people have heard of mistletoe, particularly at Christmas time.

Why, you ask? Because children aren\u2019t taught morals anymore. It\u2019s because their parents are too busy to teach them love or to care for them properly. Tomorrow is the anniversary for the Sandy Hook shooting. In honor of that, one of our local schools is currently surrounded by police because there is a shooter inside.</p>\n\n<p>Not only is this a tragedy, it\u2019s highly frustrating.

The trips may not always be that fancy, but she will have managed a fair few air miles by the time she is 1, as well as some lengthy road trips!

Your child will hear you use this word often, and you will hear it from your child as well. It\u2019s necessary for a parent to say \u201cno\u201d to a child so the child can later say \u201cno\u201d to himself. All children\u2014and some adults\u2014have difficulty delaying gratification. \u201cI want it now\u201d is a driving desire, especially in toddlers. Learning to accept \u201cno\u201d from someone else is a prelude to saying \u201cno\u201d to herself. What gets children (and adults) into trouble is a knee-jerk, impulsive reaction to a want, an immediate \u201cyes\u201d without taking time to run it through their internal sensor and consider the necessity of saying \u201cno\u201d to themselves. Here\u2019s how to use this negative little word to teach positive messages.</strong></span></p>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>1. Strike a Balance</strong></span></div>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Too many no\u2019s and too many yeses cripple a child\u2019s self- discipline. It\u2019s important to achieve the right blend of yeses and no\u2019s in a child\u2019s environment. If you rarely say \u201cno\u201d to your child, the few times that you do he\u2019ll disintegrate because he\u2019s not used to being frustrated. If his whole day is full of \u201cno\u2019s,\u201d the child believes the world is a negative place to be and will grow up a negative person. The real world will always be full of yeses and no\u2019s. In many homes, children soon learn who the yes parent is and who\u2019s more likely to say \u201cno\u201d. Even the Ten Commandments has do\u2019s and don\u2019ts.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>2. No\u2019s Grow Too</strong></span></div>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>The art of saying \u201cno\u201d develops along with your baby. During the first year, a baby\u2019s needs and wants are the same, so that you are mainly a \u201cyes\u201d parent. During the second year, baby\u2019s wants are not always safe or healthy, so you become a \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d parent. From nine to fourteen months, no-saying is straight forward. We call them \u201clow energy no\u2019s.\u201d Between fourteen and eighteen months, as babies click into overdrive, they get easily frustrated and are likely to protest being steered in a direction other than the one they want to go. This is when you will need both high energy no\u2019s and very creative alternatives. By eighteen months, no-saying can begin to be more matter-of-fact. Parents can begin to convey an attitude of \u201cthat\u2019s life and I\u2019m confident you can deal with it.\u201d By two-years-of-age toddlers are experts at saying \u201cno\u201d.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>3. Use Creative Alternatives To \u201cNo\u201d</strong></span></div>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>one morning when she was eighteen- months-old our daughter Lauren, who was going through an impulsive phase, flitted around the house climbing and getting into everything. She was endangering herself and trashing the house. After the twentieth \u201cno,\u201d I was tired of hearing that word and so was Lauren. on the wall in one of our children\u2019s bedrooms I noticed a poster of a kitten stuck out on a limb at the top of a tree. The caption read, \u201cLord, protect me from myself.\u201d I realized that Lauren needed rescuing from her impulsive self. She needed a change of environment. We spent the rest of the day outside. Parks and play-yards provide space and a \u201cyes\u201d environment in which to roam and climb. If you find yourself isolated with a curious toddler who is flitting from thing to thing with you chasing him around the house saying \u201cno,\u201d consider changing to something more fun. Go outside; take along a book, plant yourself in a safe location, and let him run.</strong></span></p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>DISCIPLINE TIP</strong></span></div>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>The fewer \u201cno\u2019s,\u201d the better your day goes.</strong></span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>4. Teach Stop Signs</strong></span></div>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Even in the early months, teach baby to recognize body language that means \u201cstop.\u201d Your baby needs to be exposed to \u201cstop\u201d body language long before hearing the \u201cno\u201d word. The first nip on your nipple during breastfeeding will invoke an \u201couch\u201d sign on your face; the first time your baby reaches for something dangerous, your face will register alarm. You are likely to get the best results from your stop signs if your baby has been used to positive body language, so that any change makes him sit up and take notice. Your \u201cno\u2019s\u201d will be more meaningful during toddlerhood if your baby sees a lot of \u201cyes\u201d body language: looks of pride and approval, gestures of delight and pleasure, eye-to-eye contact, hugs, tickles, and a sparkly face that says \u201cI love you, you\u2019re great!\u201d</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>We have noticed that attachment-parented children, because they spend hours a day in arms and in face-to-face contact, easily learn to read parents\u2019 faces and body language. Having lots of face-to- face contact in the early months makes face-to-face communication easier in the months and years to come. Some children are so impressed by body language that you can get your point across without even saying a word. An expressive mother of a connected two-year-old told us: \u201cUsually all I have to do is glance at her with a slight frown on my face, and she stops misbehaving.\u201d</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>5. Teach Stop Sounds</strong></span></div>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Often a change in your mood or body language is not enough to redirect impulsive actions. Words are needed. Children soon learn which discipline words carry more power and demand a quicker response than others. And children soon learn which tone of voice means business and which allows for some latitude. Arm yourself with a variety of \u201cstop-what-you\u2019re- doing\u201d sounds so that you can choose one that fits the occasion. Tailor the intensity of the sound to the gravity of the behavior. Save the really big sounds for true danger.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>6. Master \u201cThe Look\u201d</strong></span></div>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>You can often correct a child without saying a word. I have noticed that master disciplinarians use a look of disapproval that stops the behavior, but preserves the child\u2019s self-image. Martha, after disciplining eight children, has mastered \u201cthe look\u201d: head turned a bit, eyes penetrating, just the right facial gesture and tone of voice to convey to the child \u201cI don\u2019t like what you\u2019re doing, but I still feel connected to you. I know that you know better.\u201d Remember, your eyes will disclose what you are really thinking and feeling. If you are feeling anger or contempt toward your child, that\u2019s what she will read in your eyes. If one or both of you recognize this is happening, you will have to apologize for the harshness of the feelings communicated toward her person by \u201cthe look.\u201d Be sure that stop signs and stop sounds stop the behavior and not the growth of self-worth in your child. Your child should understand that you disapprove of the behavior, not the child. To be certain you strike the right note in disapproval discipline, follow the look with a hug, a smile, or a forthright explanation, \u201cI don\u2019t like what you did, but I like you.\u201d</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>7. Create Alternatives To The N-Word</strong></span></div>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Constantly saying \u201cno\u201d causes this word to lose its punch. Since stop sounds are used mainly to protect, try using more specific words that fit the situation. Consider this example: When a toddler is about to reach into the cat litter box your first reaction is to say \u201cno,\u201d but follow it up with an explanation: \u201cDirty! Make you sick.\u201d Next time the child goes for the litter box (and he will do it again), instead of \u201cno,\u201d say \u201cDirty! Make you sick.\u201d That and a disgusted expression on your face will help the child learn the why as well as the what of good behavior, and the litter box will lose its attraction. (We are assuming that the litter box is kept in a location well away from the toddler\u2019s beaten path. Litter, like sand, is irresistible to babies.) Babies start reaching for \u201cno-nos\u201d around six months.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Coincidentally, one day two-year-old Lauren came prancing into our study clutching a bag of peanuts. Instead of grabbing the peanuts from her and shouting \u201cno\u201d (they are on our chokable food list for children under three), Martha looked Lauren straight in the eyes and calmly said, \u201cNot for Lauren.\u201d Her tone of voice and concerned look stopped Lauren in her tracks. Martha picked Lauren up (still clutching the peanuts) and headed off for the pantry where they found a safer snack. By using our standard \u201cnot for Lauren\u201d phrase and giving her a safe alternative, she didn\u2019t have time to consider throwing a fit, which a \u201cno\u201d surely would have produced. In any family there will be items that are \u201cnot for\u201d the little one. When you use this phrase calmly and consistently from early on the toddler understands you are protecting him.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u201cNo\u201d is so easy to say. It requires no thought. It\u2019s knee-jerk automatic, yet irritatingly oppressive. Saying \u201ccannot\u201d communicates more and you\u2019ll use it more thoughtfully (i.e. in situations where baby truly cannot proceed). You\u2019re respecting his mind as you protect his body. In our experience, babies respond to \u201cstop\u201d better than to \u201cno.\u201d It gets the child\u2019s attention, and stops behavior long enough for you to plan other strategies. \u201cStop\u201d is protective rather than punitive. \u201cNo\u201d invites a clash of wills, but even strong-willed children will usually stop momentarily to evaluate a \u201cstop\u201d order, as if they sense danger ahead. Strong-minded children often ignore \u201cno\u201d if they\u2019ve heard it a thousand times before. Even \u201cstop\u201d loses its command value if overused.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>8. Use \u201cThe Voice\u201d</strong></span></div>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Besides mastering \u201cthe look,\u201d reserve a special tone of voice for those occasions when you must get your point across. A veteran disciplinarian shared her secret with us: \u201cI am an easy-going mommy, but my children know just by my tone of voice when they have crossed the line. one day our two-year-old was misbehaving and our four-year-old said, \u201cDon\u2019t mess with Mommy when she talks like that!\u201d</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>9. Give Positive Subs</strong></span></div>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Present a positive with your negative: \u201cYou can\u2019t have the knife, but you can have the ball.\u201d Use a convincing expression to market the \u201ccan do\u201d in order to soften the \u201ccan\u2019t do.\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t go across the street,\u201d you say with a matter-of-fact tone of voice; then carefully state, \u201cYou can help Mommy sweep the sidewalk.\u201d There is a bit of creative marketing in every mother.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>10. Avoid Set-ups</strong></span></div>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>If you\u2019re taking your child along with you to a toy store to buy a birthday present for your child\u2019s friend, realize that you are setting yourself up for a confrontation. Your child is likely to want to buy everything in the store. To avoid the inevitable \u201cNo, you can\u2019t have that toy,\u201d before you go into the store tell him that you are there to buy a birthday present and not a toy for him so that he is programmed not to expect a toy.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>11. \u201cNo\u201d Is a Child\u2019s Word, Too</strong></span></div>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Prepare yourself to be on the receiving end of \u201cno.\u201d Your two-year-old has just run out the door. You ask her to come back. She yells \u201cno!\u201d Your first reaction is likely to be, \u201cThis little pip-squeak is not going to talk back to me that way. I\u2019ll show her who\u2019s boss\u2026\u201d (In our family, being disrespectful is a real \u201cno-no.\u201d) Understanding what\u2019s behind that two-year-old and that two-letter word will help you accept this normal toddler behavior. Don\u2019t take \u201cno\u201d personally. Saying \u201cno\u201d is important for a child\u2019s development, and for establishing his identity as an individual. This is not defiance or a rejection of your authority. Some parents feel they cannot tolerate any \u201cno\u2019s\u201d at all from their children, thinking that to permit this would undermine their authority. They wind up curtailing an important process of self-emergence. Children have to experiment with where their mother leaves off and where they begin. Parents can learn to respect individual wishes and still stay in charge and maintain limits. As your child gets older, the ability to get along with peers in certain situations (stealing, cheating, drugs, and so on), will depend on her ability to say \u201cno\u201d.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>By eighteen months Lauren had surmised that \u201cno\u201d meant we wanted her to stop what she was doing. one day she was happily playing with water at the kitchen sink. As she saw me approaching, and in anticipation of me stopping her play, she blurted out an emphatic \u201cNo, Dad!\u201d Lauren had staked out her territory, and she had concluded she had a right to do this. Her \u201cno\u201d meant she was guarding her space.</strong></span></p>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>12. Use a Funny \u201cNo\u201d</strong></span></div>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>One afternoon I (Martha) walked into the TV room and saw Matthew and his friend watching a video that the older children had rented and watched the day before. (Later I found out Matthew had also watched it at that time.) I took one look at the movie and realized I would have to ask him to turn it off. Besides, it was the middle of the day and the boys should have been playing outside. As I stood watching the movie for a few moments planning my course of action, I caught the flavor of the character in the movie and in a spurt of inspiration decided to use humor to say no. As I clicked off the TV, I spun around on my heels and launched into a monologue using the character\u2019s facial expressions, accent, and hand gestures. I must have done a good job of impersonating this actor because both boys sat staring at me wide-eyed as though they couldn\u2019t believe their mom was capable of such improvised insanity. They both jumped up and headed out the door as the voice of this character told them to find something better to do. They were still laughing.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>13. Personalize \u201cNo\u201d</strong></span></div>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>We are convinced Lauren is destined for public relations. Her \u201cno, dad\u201d was the diplomatic way to say no. By adding \u201cdad\u201d she personalized her message. Rather than giving a dictatorial \u201cno,\u201d we add the child\u2019s name. If you tend to shout, a personalized address at least softens the sound and respects the listener. Some parents confuse respecting the child with granting him equal power, but this is not a power issue. The person with the power should respect the person taken charge of. That consideration holds true in parenting; it holds true in other relationships as well.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>14.

I want to enjoy being a mother but our whole day is spent in conflict with each other. Andrew won\u2019t mind when I ask him to do even the simplest things. I\u2019m becoming a cranky person, and I want to be a happy mother.\u201d I advised her, \u201cTell Andrew exactly what you want. Say \u2018I want to be a happy Mommy, not a cranky Mommy. (or ask Andrew \u2018Would you rather have a happy Mommy or a cranky Mommy?\u2019) To help me be a happy Mommy, we\u2019re going to have yes days. Every time I ask you to do something and you say \u2018yes Mommy,\u2019 I\u2019m going to put a yes on the chart. At the end of the day if there are more yeses than no\u2019s, that\u2019s a yes day, and we\u2019ll do something special together.\u2019\u201d (or, let Andrew mark yes on his own chart.) Soon Andrew will realize that the happy Mommy is more fun to be with than the cranky Mommy, which will motivate him to continue having yes days.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>15. Be Considerate</strong></span></div>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>When you have to stop a behavior, there is no reason to be rude. For example, your baby discovers the tape dispenser someone left out. This is a wonderful toy. Instead of descending on him and snatching it from his hands, causing him to wail pitifully as you carry him off, you can take a few moments to explore it with him. Then you say \u201cbye-bye\u201d to the tape and hand him a decent length of the fascinating stuff to compensate for not getting the whole roll as you head off for a perhaps less interesting, but more age-appropriate activity.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>16. When You Say It, Mean It</strong></span></div>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Follow through on your directives. For months we said to Lauren that in order to have bedtime stories she had to submit to toothbrushing.

Are You a Mother Who Can\u2019t Say No</strong></span></div>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>In their zeal to give their children everything they need, some parents risk giving their children everything they want. Mothers who practice attachment parenting risk becoming totally \u201cyes\u201d mothers, with \u201cno\u201d being foreign to their parenting style.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>It is important for the mother to feel comfortable saying \u2018no\u2019 to her little one from the very beginning. In fact, it begins when she teaches her newborn to latch on to the breast correctly. It is the mother\u2019s first discipline situation\u2014 to show baby how to latch on properly so that he can get fed sufficiently and she can avoid sore nipples. Some mothers cannot do this. They are afraid to be assertive for fear of causing baby to cry. They would rather let the baby do it wrong and put up with the pain. She will say \u2018no\u2019 early on when he yanks her hair or bites the breast while nursing. By telling him to stop because it hurts, she is beginning to teach boundaries. Serious no-saying comes with toddlerhood. Besides the literal word \u2018no\u2019 there are many ways to communicate that something is not safe or appropriate. Whether she says \u201cstop that\u201d or \u201cput it down\u201d or \u201cnot safe,\u201d or she physically redirects her toddler\u2019s activity, she is consistently and gently redirecting behavior and teaching boundaries. Whatever the terminology, saying \u2018no\u2019 is not a negative thing. It is a way of giving, and it takes a lot of effort. Mothers who can\u2019t say \u2018no\u2019 will have a big problem on their hands down the line. They become the moms that we see getting yanked around like puppets by their preschoolers.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>When mothers begin saying \u2018no\u2019 at the appropriate times\u2014confidently, firmly, and lovingly\u2014It does not threaten the child. It might wrinkle him for a few minutes because he doesn\u2019t like hearing \u2018stop\u2019 or \u2018wait\u2019 or whatever the word might be that you pick.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>18. When Your Child Won\u2019t Accept No</strong></span></div>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Children, especially those with a strong will, try to wear parents down. They are convinced they must have something or their world can\u2019t go on. They pester and badger until you say \u201cyes\u201d just to stop the wear and tear on your nerves. This is faulty discipline. If however, your child\u2019s request seems reasonable after careful listening, be willing to negotiate. Sometimes you may find it wise to change your mind after saying \u201cno\u201d. While you want your child to believe your \u201cno\u201d means no, you also want your child to feel you are approachable and flexible. It helps to hold your \u201cno\u201d until you\u2019ve heard your child out. If you sense your child is uncharacteristically crushed or angry at your \u201cno,\u201d listen to her side. Maybe she has a point you hadn\u2019t considered or her request is a bigger deal to her than you imagined. Be open to reversing your decision, if warranted. Make sure, though, that she realizes it was not her \u201cwear down\u201d tactics that got the reversal of your decision.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Our daughter Erin seems destined to become a trial lawyer; she pleads her case with logic and emotion. Eventually, we learned to say \u201cno\u201d without discouraging Erin\u2019s creative persistence. When Erin wanted a horse, we said \u201cno\u201d (we had too many dependents already). Erin persisted. By trial and error we\u2019ve learned that any big wish in a child, no matter how ridiculous, merits hearing the child\u2019s viewpoint. We listened attentively and empathetically while Erin presented her horse wish. We countered, \u201cErin, we understand why you want a horse. You could have a lot of fun riding and grooming a horse, and some of your friends have horses.\u201d (We wanted Erin to feel we understood her point of view). \u201cBut we have to say no; and we will not change our minds. Now let\u2019s sit down and calmly work this out.\u201d (Letting the child know her request is non-negotiable diffuses the child\u2019s steam and saves you from getting worn down.) \u201cYou are not yet ready to care for a horse.\u201d (We enumerated the responsibilities that went along with the fun of owning a horse.) \u201cWhen you have finished another six months of lessons and you show us that you can be responsible for a horse, we\u2019ll talk about it then.\u201d Nine months later Tuffy was added to our list of dependents. Erin got her horse and she learned some valuable lessons in life: how to delay her gratification, and with privileges come responsibilities.</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n", "post_id": 2074, "location": false, "date": "12-16-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Blow Your Nose", "the\u00a0flu", "allaboutmanners animals aviation books breakfast cars children climate cooking dessert FAMILY food frog gaming Gillian Sims good manners health home kids lifestyle literature love manners mental-healt", "nasal congestion"], "text": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></div>\n<div>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/fluman.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2078\" alt=\"FluMan\" src=\"https://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/fluman.png?w=491&#038;h=512\" width=\"491\" height=\"512\" /></a></p>\n</div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></div>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>With no cure in sight for the cold or the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/default.htm\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">flu</span></a>, over-the-counter treatments can at best bring symptom relief or shorten the duration of those symptoms.

Tattle to the teacher and rat your friends out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">C. Tell your friends you have come down with a sudden case of \u201cCheatervirus\u201d and have to go home NOW. Then pretend to be sick at home until the test is over. Of course, this would mean that your parents may decide to take you to the doctor to treat your illness.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">D. Remind your friends that learning the schoolwork is much easier than cheating and offer to help them study for the test instead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">3.

When your parents ask about the messy floor, pretend you do not see any mud. \u201cDirty floor? What dirty floor?\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">4.

Tell your mom and dad that you are copying their own eating habits.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">B. Ask for a mirror so you can see if they are correct.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">C. Politely close your mouth and continue eating.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">D.

My house is chaos, the kids have been hyper and and we have all consumed far too much. Our stress levels at times have been off the scale and the parties feel like a distant memory already. Yet for parents like me so much about Christmas is just a reflection of real life all year round. Let me explain:</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. At Christmas time you spend a lot of time inviting people to, and attending parties. </strong></p>\n\n<p>As a special needs parent I spend much of the year inviting professionals to meetings and attending meetings and training courses.

In this article I examine some of the myths, behaviors, personality characteristics, and red flags of a blogging addiction.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Here are some common myths about bloggers and addiction.</strong></span></p>\n<ul style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>I can\u2019t be addicted to blogging because it isn\u2019t a mind-altering chemical.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>I am employed, and only blog when I am not busy with my job, although I might blog at work if I have time.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>I only blog on important topics \u2013 well, important topics to me.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>I only blog to make a difference in people\u2019s lives. If I don\u2019t do it, who will?</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>I can stop blogging anytime I want. I just don\u2019t want to stop. This is not hurting me or anyone else.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>I am not addicted, that is a term for alcoholics and substance abusers \u2013 coke heads, meth addicts. Blogging isn\u2019t a drug.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>I still go to work every day and it doesn\u2019t count if I work on my blog(s) during my downtime or check the website(s) for comments.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>I hardly ever use a sick day to stay home and blog or to catch up on errands that didn\u2019t get completed because of blogging.</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Do you recognize yourself in any of those?</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>There are also some behaviors that have been identified as common in addictive personalities.\u00a0 With respect to blogging, these include:</strong></span></p>\n<ul style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Denying there is an issue with blogging. Denial is the ability to overlook negative consequences so as to be able to justify continuing to engage in a behavior. There might be an awareness that the blogging is creating turmoil, but the desire to blog is stronger than the pressure to stop. Loss of control, being unable to stop the behavior, and continuing to engage in the behavior regardless of adverse consequences are some of the most definitive features of addiction.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Lying about the time spent engaged in \u201cblogging behaviors.\u201d</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Losing track of time and being late for events, appointments, and celebrations because of blogging.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Changes in sleep habits and patterns because of blogging or needing to respond to comments. Getting up in the middle or the night or very early before going to work to check the blog, write the blog, or make comments.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Feeling guilty or confused about the effect blogging is having on your life.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Disbelief that it is possible to be addicted to blogging.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Financial problems due to blogging\u2014such as not paying bills on time because of being consumed by blogging.</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Not all of these may apply, but if more than two describe you and your current blogging lifestyle it could be a red flag that blogging is impacting your life in a negative manner.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>To sort this out, ask yourself the following questions:</strong></span></p>\n<ul style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Have you ever lost time from work because of blogging?</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Does blogging create problems for you with other people in your life?</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Do you blog because you feel shy and uncomfortable around others?</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Have you ever felt guilty about blogging?</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Have you ever argued with someone significant in your life about blogging and the time constraints involved?</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Are you more careless in other areas of your life because of blogging?</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Have you lost interest in other areas of your life since beginning to blog?</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Do you blog to escape anything in your life?</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Do you use blogging as a replacement for social interactions in the real world?</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Do you feel compelled to blog and then feel a sense of elation once the blog entry is published \u2013 yet the high is short-lived and you feel compelled to begin again?</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Do you feel restless if you do not blog?</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>If you answered \u201cYes\u201d to two or more of those questions, blogging could be taking over your life.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Finally, let\u2019s consider the characteristics of an addictive personality in general.</strong></span></p>\n<ul style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Impatience with self and others.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Anxiety in an exaggerated form. It is normal to feel anxious, but in addicts it is constant and chronic. Using the substance of choice, whether it be alcohol, substances, or the Internet, brings momentary relief.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Grandiosity \u2013 feelings of deep worthlessness and low self-esteem covered by haughtiness or pretending to &#8220;have It all together.&#8221;</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Perfectionism \u2013 setting impossible and improbable goals for oneself. Perceived failures result in guilt and self-deprecation.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Rationalizations \u2013 Addicts of any sort are pros at this. Finding justifications for doing what one wants and making it all seem reasonable and plausible.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Isolation \u2013 Blogging is so consuming that it prohibits you from forming deep and lasting relationships outside the Internet world. You becomes a loner in the real world.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Sensitivity \u2013 to criticisms from others related to blogging behaviors.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Impulsivity \u2013 Having a great idea for a blog post and feeling the need to address it and write about it immediately. Becoming irritated if you are unable to blog when the idea presents itself.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Dependence \u2013 A strong dependence on others&#8217; reactions and responses to what was posted. A need to be affirmed.</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Discussing blogging as an addiction may seem odd, but it is possible to become addicted to anything. Addiction is addiction is addiction, regardless of the substance of choice. Can you identify with much of what has been written in this piece? A \u201cYes\u201d may indicate a need to take a hiatus from the blogosphere for a time. If you are unable to stop blogging, then talking to a professional about this compulsion may be helpful.

Psychologically it\u2019s the start of a fresh new year, and physically it follows a period of over-indulgence and, probably, an amount of unhealthy eating and drinking. So start the New Year by giving your body the chance to make the most of the opportunities ahead.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Detoxing has many benefits \u2013 it can enhance your energy levels, aid weight loss, clear the skin and improve digestion.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Here\u2019s eight easy steps to help you get started on your healthy new year:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>1) Avoid black tea, coffee and alcohol. Instead drink herbal tea, for example nettle is great at supporting the kidneys.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>2) Drink at least 1 litre of water per day \u2013 ideally more. Keep a bottle by your desk and sip regularly \u2013 you\u2019ll be amazed how easy it is if you drink little and often.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>3) Drink fresh juices, e.g. carrot, beetroot, apple and cucumber as they are fantastically nourishing and cleansing.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>4) Avoid processed foods e.g. ready meals, savory snacks and biscuits. Instead eat food in its natural state. Cook it by steaming, lightly boiling or poaching \u2013 this way you will keep most of the goodness in the food (and retain the full flavour).</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>5) Chose organic food in order to minimize your intake of toxic pesticides. Even if you can\u2019t make every item organic, do the best you can \u2013 it will make a difference</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>6) Eat at least five portions of fruit and vegetables per day \u2013 ideally more.

Expect the best for yourself.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>There\u2019s nothing selfish in wanting to live the best possible life. Set your sights high, push yourself and always keep the big picture in mind. You\u2019re going to need a fair amount of discipline to stay focused and achieve a life that you love, that you\u2019re passionate about and that makes you happy. You know it\u2019ll be worth it!</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>2. Love your gorgeous self.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>The above can\u2019t be achieved if you don\u2019t appreciate yourself, warts and all. I\u2019m my own toughest critic, but when I let up on myself once and while and pat myself on the back for my achievements I feel pretty damn proud. So congratulate yourself during the year when you\u2019re making great progress. Take time out to treat yourself each time you reach a milestone.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>3. Have a grand vision for your business.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Let\u2019s face it 2013 was a tough year for anyone in business. 2014 can only get better so it\u2019s time to envision the success your business will have in the New Year, the growth it will experience and the traction you\u2019ll make through consistent and concerted effort in the right places.\u00a0Keep that picture in your mind and solidify it on a daily basis through whatever works for you \u2013 vision boards, written statements, weekly progress sheets or constructive team meetings.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>4. Surround yourself with positivity.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>No matter what, stay positive. \u00a0Just stick to your company\u2019s vision and think positive. Remember that problems don\u2019t last long and having an optimistic outlook will get you through the toughest times. If you can\u2019t muster it yourself, then turn to your support network of your best friends, mentors and advisors. Learn to let other people help you.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>5. Plan ahead.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>It is always best to have a clear plan in anything you do in life, especially in business. Better yet you should aim to have a plan A and a plan B for those times when things just aren\u2019t working out. Flexibility and acting decisively on changes in your business landscape are key to success.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>6. Bridge the gap.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>A new year is also a year to re-connect with contacts and to start afresh with previous business relationships that may have gone sour. Learn to forgive. If you had a client or customer interaction that ended on a bad note then get in touch and ask how they are doing. Conduct business with an open heart and mind. It\u2019s the best way forward for everyone.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>7. Socialize more.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Get out and experience the world outside of your comfort zone, known as your office. Meet new people and exchange business cards with them. Who knows, that new acquaintance might be your next loyal client or future business collaboration. It invigorates your soul to meet with like-minded people and to learn from them.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>8. Become trendy.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Study the market and visualize what your target market may need or be interested in for the coming year. Read up on daily basis about emerging trends in your business space so you can stay ahead of the game, and prepare for your next move towards making your business more profitable.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>9. Share your fortunes.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Become a shining example of corporate social responsibility. Plan an activity where your company can contribute and help the less fortunate members of the community. It doesn\u2019t have to be a grand party that needs to be publicized. A simple act of donating to an organization that\u2019s making a difference is enough to show you care.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>10. Relax and enjoy life.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>It\u2019s easy to say this when you\u2019re on holiday but it really won\u2019t hurt if let yourself enjoy yourself with mini breaks throughout the year. Yes, as entrepreneurs we tend to love our business and become addicted to it, but taking a break to recharge will do you and your business wonders.</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n", "post_id": 2164, "location": false, "date": "12-29-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Hooray", "allaboutmanners animals aviation books breakfast cars children climate cooking dessert FAMILY food frog gaming Gillian Sims good manners health home kids lifestyle literature love manners mental-healt", "new years day"], "text": "<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/january.gif\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2171\" alt=\"january\" src=\"https://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/january.gif?w=397&#038;h=360\" width=\"397\" height=\"360\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#3366ff;\"><strong>Hooray!

And even if parents think that they&#8217;re going to enjoy their new found space, everyone experiences some sense of loss.

And while you may not be fulfilling the same role as before, remember that your child still needs you, but in a different way.

Encourage them to make a\u00a0<a href=\"http://moving.about.com/od/preparingforyourmove/a/move_residence.htm\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">list of things they&#8217;ll need</span></a>, including important dates, such as registration and move-in days, and what they might require for their first apartment or\u00a0<a href=\"http://moving.about.com/od/preparingforyourmove/a/move_residence.htm\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">for their dorm room</span></a>; however, leave the actual planning to them, letting them know that you&#8217;re around to help or to offer moving advice.</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Try to advise them without pushing:\u00a0The best way of communicating with your grown child is to ask questions without any prejudgment. Many of us ask our children a question, knowing ahead of time what we want their answer to be; when the answer is different than what we want, our response usually let&#8217;s our child know that we don&#8217;t agree. While we may not agree, remember that it&#8217;s time for your child to make their own decisions and to trust that your years of guidance and instilled values will guide them through. Try to be open and if you really disagree with their decision, let them know by offering your alternative without pushing.</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Try not to label.\u00a0When a student enters college, there&#8217;s a lot of pressure to be someone, whether that&#8217;s a doctor or business major or filmmaker. Labels should be avoided as much as possible. While we may be proud of our child&#8217;s goals, we should allow space for those goals to develop or even change completely. College is a time when your child can explore options for a career and to find their own passions and their own way. Even if that career choice is not something we had been hoping for; remember that our passions as parents are not necessarily, and most likely are not, the passions of our children.</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Communicate:\u00a0Let your child know that you&#8217;re going to miss them and establish upfront what you expect in terms of communication. If you prefer that they call you every week, then let them know and provide them a means of doing so (phone card, etc&#8230;). Be flexible in your expectations and suggest alternatives, such as email or text messaging. Also, let your child know that you&#8217;re always there if they need you, however, the best solution is not always to run when your child calls. It&#8217;s best to let them sort out their own problems and issues and to become simply the shoulder to cry on rather than the one who solves everything.</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Money and finances:\u00a0Make sure you go over any financial issues that your child needs to know, particularly if you&#8217;re supporting them. Ensure that they&#8217;re aware of their own personal\u00a0<a href=\"http://moving.about.com/od/preparingforyourmove/a/first_home.htm\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">budget</span></a>\u00a0and what you expect from them in terms of spending and resources. Let them know that they need to stay within a certain budget and that it&#8217;s their responsibility to do so. If more money is required for unknown or unexpected costs associated with school, they should let you know ahead of time and not expect you to &#8220;bail them out&#8221;. Part of growing up is taking care of their own accounts and learning how to budget.</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>After they move out, give yourself time to adjust.\u00a0As you know, being a parent is more than a full-time job, caring for and ensuring our children&#8217;s needs are met. When a child moves out, that time we once spent caring for our child belongs to us again, and while that may feel strange and you may feel a little lost, it&#8217;s important for you to try and redirect your focus back onto yourself. Before your child leaves, start preparing by making a list of the things you want to do, including any hobbies, house fix-ups, books or courses that you&#8217;ve put off doing because of time. Do something nice for yourself. Be good to yourself.</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>If you&#8217;re married or in a partnership, re-establish your relationship.\u00a0Many married people find that after the children leave, they have a difficult time adjusting to being a couple again. Try to start focusing on your relationship by arranging dates, making social plans together or by taking up a new hobby. Reconnecting will happen if you give it time and make it a priority.</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n", "post_id": 2185, "location": false, "date": "01-04-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["moving out", "allaboutmanners animals aviation books breakfast cars children climate cooking dessert FAMILY food frog gaming Gillian Sims good manners health home kids lifestyle literature love manners mental-healt"], "text": "<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><a href=\"http://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/teenagers_move_out_house_3683_1457492863.png\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2189\" alt=\"Teenagers_Move_Out_House_3683_1457492863\" src=\"https://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/teenagers_move_out_house_3683_1457492863.png?w=484&#038;h=306\" width=\"484\" height=\"306\" /></span></a></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>First, it was the eldest at the age of 22</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"> <strong>then the second one at 20</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"> <strong>then the third one at her 18th birthday</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"> <strong>saying, \u201cMa and Pa, it\u2019s time to go\u201d.\u00a0</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"> <strong>It is journeying to the pinnacle of</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"> <strong>dreams, a taste of freedom</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"> <strong>like the birds reaching up the sky.\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>It is silent and lonely</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"> <strong>without my three girls\u00a0</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"> <strong>They have moved out with a smile</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"> <strong>and their rooms are left bereft</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"> <strong>saved of the few boxes</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"> <strong>that they may pick up once in a while-</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"> <strong>boxes of their childhood and memories.\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>This vacuum of my girls\u2019 absence</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"> <strong>will ever dwell because their presence</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"> <strong>has graced this home and this garden.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"> <strong>But they cannot stay here forever</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"> <strong>they have their own life now to try</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"> <strong>which I might as well bless each day.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>I have been used to cooking\u00a0</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"> <strong>for 6 or more with their friends</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"> <strong>around this old table of two decades</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"> <strong>Now the table is silent too</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"> <strong>bereft of laughter and seeming debates</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"> <strong>My girls have moved out.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>I must therefore accept</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"> <strong>Children are never ours to keep</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"> <strong>But priceless jewels to be released.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Elizabeth Padillo Olesen, Denmark</strong></span></p>\n", "post_id": 2188, "location": false, "date": "01-04-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["collage", "allaboutmanners animals aviation books breakfast cars children climate cooking dessert FAMILY food frog gaming Gillian Sims good manners health home kids lifestyle literature love manners mental-healt"], "text": "<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<a href=\"http://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/imagesbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2193\" alt=\"imagesbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb\" src=\"https://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/imagesbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb.jpg?w=263&#038;h=191\" width=\"263\" height=\"191\" /></a><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><br />\n</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Parents are the coolest people to hang out with.

Make sure your child is familiar with the school.</em>\u00a0 If she was at the same school last year, great! You only need to talk about any differences this year.<em>(\u201cNow that you\u2019re in first grade, you get to play on the big kids playground, and go eat in the lunchroom with the other kids.\u201d \u201cNow that you\u2019ll be in third grade, you\u2019ll have homework every day.\u201d \u201cNow that you\u2019ll be in middle school, you\u2019ll be walking by yourself.\u00a0 We\u2019ll need to practice crossing Main Street.\u201d )\u00a0</em></strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>But if this is her first year at this school, then you\u2019ll want to take some trips there.\u00a0 Even if there is a formal orientation day just before school begins, start now by taking a trip to the school.\u00a0 If you can get access to the playground, that\u2019s a terrific way to help your child bond with her new school.\u00a0 If not, at least admire it through the fence and get her excited about the slide or climbing structure. \u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>If the building is open, by all means walk in together to check it out.\u00a0 If you\u2019re allowed to poke your head in the library, peer into a classroom or two, and use the bathroom (important in making her feel more secure there) you\u2019ve hit the jackpot.\u00a0 You may not get much further than the office, where you can explain that your child will be starting school in the fall and wanted to see what the school was like, and introduce her to the front office staff.\u00a0 Either way, the more your child sees of the school, the less she\u2019ll fret with fear of the unknown, and the more comfortable she\u2019ll feel on the first day. \u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><em>2. Take advantage of any orientation opportunities.</em>\u00a0 Many schools let new students, especially in the younger grades, come to school for an orientation session before school begins.\u00a0 If the school doesn\u2019t have such a program, ask if you and your child can come by to meet the new teacher for a few minutes a day or so before school starts.\u00a0 Teachers are busy preparing their rooms and materials at that time, but any experienced teacher is happy to take a few minutes to meet a new student and make him feel comfortable, since she knows that helps her students settle into the school year.\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><em>3. Facilitate your child\u2019s bonding with the teacher.</em>\u00a0 All kids need to feel connected to their teacher to feel comfortable in the classroom.\u00a0\u00a0 Until they do, they are not ready to learn.\u00a0 Experienced teachers know this, and \u201ccollect\u201d their students emotionally at the start of the school year.\u00a0 Obviously, if you can arrange for your child to meet the teacher in advance, by all means do so.\u00a0 But there are lots of ways to help your child feel like he knows even a teacher he\u2019s never met.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Once you find out your child\u2019s classroom assignment, begin talking about the teacher in fond and familiar terms. (\u201c<em>When you\u2019re in Ms. Williams class, I bet she\u2019ll be impressed with what a great cleaner-upper you are.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that Ms. Williams reads stories to the kids, she might read your favorite book if we bring it to school.\u201d</em>)\u00a0 If you can find a photo of Ms. Williams, by all means put it up on your refrigerator and speak to it fondly (<em>\u201cMs. Williams, you are a great kindergarten teacher and I just know you and my David are going to love each other!\u201d</em>)\u00a0 If you know other kids who have been in Ms. Williams\u2019 class, ask them to tell your child what their favorite thing was about her.\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Encourage your child to draw a picture to bring Ms. Williams on the first day, and to pick out a shiny red apple for her.\u00a0 Note that it doesn\u2019t really matter what kind of teacher Ms. Williams is.\u00a0 Your child will feel a fondness for her to which she is likely to respond favorably.\u00a0 Regardless, the feeling of familiarity will help your child bond with her.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>If you notice in the first week of school that your child doesn\u2019t seem to have connected with his teacher, don\u2019t hesitate to immediately contact her.\u00a0 Just explain that your child was excited before school started but doesn\u2019t seem to have settled in yet.\u00a0 You\u2019re hoping that the teacher can make a special effort to reach out to him so he connects with her and feels at home.\u00a0 Virtually all teachers understand this issue and will pay extra attention to your child during that first week if you make a nice request.\u00a0\u00a0 My own daughter cried every day at the start of fourth grade until I had a conversation with the teacher; a week later she loved him and couldn\u2019t wait to go to school in the morning.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><em><br />\n4. Facilitate bonding with the other kids.</em>\u00a0Kids are always nervous about their new teacher, but if they know any of the other kids, they\u2019ll feel more at ease.\u00a0\u00a0 If you\u2019re new in town, make a special effort to meet other kids in the neighborhood.\u00a0 Often schools are willing to introduce new families to each other, allowing kids to connect with other new students in the weeks before school starts.\u00a0 Even if your child is not new to the school, find out what other kids are in her class and arrange a playdate so she\u2019ll feel more connected if she hasn\u2019t seen these kids all summer. If you can arrange for your son or daughter to travel to school that first morning with a child he or she knows, even if they aren\u2019t in the same classroom, it will ease last minute jitters.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><br />\n<em>5. Practice saying goodbye.</em>\u00a0If your child is beginning school for the first time and has not had previous daycare or preschool experience, his or her biggest challenge will be saying goodbye to you.\u00a0 Explain that all children go to school to learn, which is a child\u2019s job just like parents work at jobs.\u00a0 Orchestrate small separations to practice saying goodbye, and develop a parting routine, such as a hug and a saying like\u00a0<em>\u201cI love you, you love me, have a great day and I\u2019ll see you at 3!\u201d</em></strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>You might give your child a token to hold on to that reminds her of you, such as a cut-out heart with a love note, your scarf, or a small stone you found on the beach together, that she can keep in her pocket while you\u2019re apart and give back upon your return.\u00a0 Most kids like to have a picture of the family in their backpacks.\u00a0 Be sure to use the suggestions above for helping her bond with her new teacher; she needs to transfer her attachment focus from you to the teacher if she is to successfully let you go.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><em>6. Ask the school whether you will be able to walk your child into the classroom and hand him off to the teacher.</em>\u00a0 Find out how long you will be able to stay.\u00a0 If you suspect that your child might have a hard time saying goodbye, by all means speak with the teacher now and make a plan for how to handle the first day.\u00a0 Maybe every morning you will read your child one story and then take her over to the teacher when you say goodbye, so the teacher can comfort and distract her. \u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Once you have a plan, begin describing to your child what will happen at school.\u00a0 But don\u2019t emphasize the goodbye, keep right on going with how fun the day will be:\u00a0<em>\u201cEvery morning you will pick a book for me to read to you.\u00a0 When we finish the story, we will find Ms. Williams together.\u00a0 We\u2019ll give each other a big hug and say our special goodbye.\u00a0 Then Ms. Williams will hold your hand and take you to the block corner where you and Michael can build a tall tower while I go to work.\u00a0 You will have snack, and play outside, and read stories, and have lunch.\u00a0 Every day when I pick you up I will be excited to hear what you built in the block corner that day.\u201d</em></strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><em>7. Start conversations about the next grade at school or about beginning school.\u00a0</em>\u00a0One good way to do this is to select books relating to that grade.\u00a0 Your librarian can be helpful; some good choices include books by Alan &amp; Janet Ahlberg, Stan &amp; Jan Berenstain, Dianne Blomberg, Marc Brown, Lauren Child, Julie Danneberg, Bonnie Graves, James Howe, Beth Norling, Marisabina Russo, and Amy Schwartz. \u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Get your kids excited by talking about what they can expect, including snack, playground, reading, computers, singing and art.\u00a0 If you know other children who will be in his class or in the school, be sure to mention that he will see or play with them.\u00a0 Share your own stories about things you loved about school.\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Encourage her questions by asking what she thinks school will be like.\u00a0 Emphasize the things you think she\u2019ll enjoy but be sure not to minimize her fears; kids can be stricken by worries that adults might find silly, like finding the bathroom at school. Normalize any fears and reassure her that she will have fun, that the school can reach you if necessary, and that your love is always with her even when you aren\u2019t. Be sure to end every conversation with<em>\u201cand when school is over I will be there to pick you up and we\u2019ll have a special snack while you tell me all about your day\u201d</em>\u00a0so that every time your child thinks about school, she remembers this reassurance.\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><em>8. If a younger sibling will be at home with you,</em>\u00a0be sure your child knows how boring it will be at home and how jealous you and the younger sibling are that you don\u2019t get to go to school like a big kid.\u00a0 Explain that every day after school you will have special time with your big girl to hear all about her day and have a snack together.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><em>9. Get your kids back on an early to bed schedule well before school starts.</em>\u00a0\u00a0Most kids begin staying up late in the summer months.\u00a0 But kids need 9 1/2 to 11 hours of sleep a night, depending on their age.\u00a0 (Teens need a minimum of 9.5; toddlers usually do best with 11). Getting them back on schedule so they\u2019re sound asleep by 9pm to be up at 7am for school takes a couple of weeks of gradually moving the bedtime earlier.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Imposing an early bedtime cold turkey the night before school starts results in a child who simply isn\u2019t ready for an earlier bedtime, having slept in that morning and with the night-before-school jitters.\u00a0 In that situation, you can expect everyone\u2019s anxiety to escalate.\u00a0 So keep an eye on the calendar and start moving bedtime a bit earlier every night by having kids read in bed for an hour before lights out, which is also good for their reading skills.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><em>10. Wake up your child\u2019s brain.\u00a0</em>\u00a0You aren\u2019t the teacher, and you don\u2019t need to start school before the school year starts by pulling out the flashcards or assigning math problems.\u00a0 On the other hand, research shows that kids forget a lot during the summer.\u00a0 If your child has been reading through the summer months, congratulations!\u00a0 If not, this is the time to start.\u00a0 Visit the library and let him pick some books he\u2019ll enjoy.\u00a0 Introduce the idea that for the rest of the summer everyone in the family (you can include yourself if you like, or you can read to them) will read for an hour every day.\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>And if your child has assignments to complete, don\u2019t wait for him to remember the day before school starts that he was supposed to write a book report.\u00a0 Get summer work out of the way at least a week before school starts so he can relax for the rest of vacation!</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><em>11. Let your child choose his own school supplies,</em>\u00a0whether from around your house or from the store, and ready them in his backpack or bag. \u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><em>12. The day before school starts, talk about exactly what will happen the next day</em>\u00a0to give your child a comfortable mental movie:</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><em>\u201cWe\u2019ll get up early tomorrow for your first day in Ms. Williams\u2019 class.\u00a0 We will drive there together and I will take you into her classroom and introduce you to her.\u00a0 She will make sure you know all the other kids, because they will be your new friends. I will read a book to you and then we will hug and say our special goodbye.\u00a0 Then Ms. Williams will take you to the block corner so you can build a tower.\u00a0 Ms. Williams will show you where the bathroom is, and you can ask her anytime you need to go.\u00a0 There will be games and books and blocks, and she will read to the class.\u00a0 You will get to have fun on the playground with the other kids, and you will get to sit at a desk like the big kids.\u00a0 And at the end of the day, Ms. Williams will bring you to me on the school steps, and I will be there to pick you up and hear all about your first day at school.\u201d</em></strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Be alert for signs that your child is worried, and reflect that most kids are a little nervous before the first day of school, but that he will feel right at home in his new classroom soon. \u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><em>13.

If your child gets teary when you say goodbye</em>, reassure her that she will be fine and that you can\u2019t wait to see her at the end of the day.\u00a0 Use the goodbye routine you\u2019ve practiced, and then hand her off to her teacher.\u00a0 Don\u2019t leave her adrift without a new attachment person, but once you\u2019ve put her in good hands, don\u2019t worry.\u00a0 Experienced teachers know about first day jitters and are used to bonding with their charges. Her tears won\u2019t last long.\u00a0 If your child continues to have a hard time separating, be sure to speak with the teacher.\u00a0 Maybe she can give her a special job every morning, or facilitate a friendship with another child who has similar interests.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><br />\n<em>15. Make sure you\u2019re a few minutes early to pick your child up that first week of school.</em>\u00a0 Not seeing you immediately will exacerbate any anxieties he has and may panic him altogether.\u00a0 If your child cries when you pick him up, don\u2019t worry.\u00a0 You\u2019re seeing the stress of his having to keep it together all day and be a big boy.\u00a0 Your return signals that it\u2019s safe to be his babyself again, take it as a compliment.\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>This is true for kids of all ages, who may have uncharacteristic meltdowns during the first week of school, or just before school starts.\u00a0 Chalk it up to stress, don\u2019t be hard on them, and be sure you\u2019re there to talk so they don\u2019t have to resort to tantrums.\u00a0 Before you know it everyone will be comfortable in their new routine and not even looking back as they race into school.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">WHAT DO HAVE TO SAY ON THE SUBJECT</span></p>\n", "post_id": 2199, "location": false, "date": "01-05-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["drugs", "allaboutmanners animals aviation books breakfast cars children climate cooking dessert FAMILY food frog gaming Gillian Sims good manners health home kids lifestyle literature love manners mental-healt"], "text": "<h3 style=\"text-align:center;\"></h3>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center;\"></h3>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/signs-heroin-addiction.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2205\" alt=\"signs-heroin-addiction\" src=\"https://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/signs-heroin-addiction.jpg?w=300&#038;h=96\" width=\"300\" height=\"96\" /></a></h3>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center;\"></h3>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>She had a sister who was also her best friend.

If we can assume that a choice is meant to bring us to a desired state of being rather than to a less desirable condition, then first we need to consider what the destination is that we hope to arrive at through our choice, and then the \u2018right\u2019 direction should be more clear. No one else, though, can tell us what is the \u2018right\u2019 course to take. A better choice is one that \u2018rings true\u2019 with your own deepest self.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>I remember when I had a choice to make of what college to attend after high school. I had applied to and been accepted by three universities in the State University of New York system. I visited all three but that only made my choice more difficult, as each had special qualities I liked. Someone gave me a good idea which helped a lot. I wrote positive and negative considerations in two columns for all 3 choices and then I looked to see objectively which choice had the most positive aspects listed. But then, I asked myself how I felt about that choice, and I knew instinctively that the one with the most \u2018positives\u2019 was not the one my heart was interested in.\u00a0 I chose the college closest to home because I wanted to maintain some cherished friendships. That proved to be obviously the right choice for me, down the road.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Here is a poem by William Butler Yeats about \u2018better choices\u2019:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>What Then?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>His chosen comrades thought at school</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>He must grow a famous man;</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>He thought the same and lived by rule,</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>All his twenties crammed with toil;</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u2018What then?\u2019 sang Plato\u2019s ghost. \u2018What then?\u2019</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Everything he wrote was read,</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>After certain years he won</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Sufficient money for his need, Friends that have been friends indeed;</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u2018What then?\u2019 sang Plato\u2019s ghost. \u2018 What then?\u2019</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>All his happier dreams came true \u2013</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>A small old house, wife, daughter, son,</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Grounds where plum and cabbage grew,</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>poets and wits about him drew;</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u2018What then.?\u2019 sang Plato\u2019s ghost. \u2018What then?\u2019</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>The work is done,\u2019 grown old he thought,</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u2018According to my boyish plan;</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Let the fools rage, I swerved in naught,</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Something to perfection brought\u2019;</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>But louder sang that ghost, \u2018What then?\u2019</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Yeats\u2019 poem has an almost eerie quality to it in relation to the matter of discerning \u2018better choices\u2019. How can we choose proactively rather than having to look back in retrospect to see whether our choice has led to personal fulfilment, or not? Some of you might be familiar with the book\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Journey-Souls-Studies-Between-Lives/dp/1567184855\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">The Journey of Souls</span></a>\u00a0by Dr. Michael Newton. This book puts the topic of better choices into a much larger scope. It deals \u2013(whatever your personal approach, this book brings in\u00a0 reincarnation as described under hypnosis by people being regressed)\u2013with the question of whether in a given lifetime we have fulfilled our goal or learned our lessons of that lifetime! A more popular example of this idea is in the fun movie\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.moviesunlimited.com/musite/product.asp?sku=D21783&amp;gclid=CJya5c2n7rsCFbA7Mgodb2EAVg\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">\u201cDefending Your Life\u201d</span></a>, one of my favorites. Here, Albert Brooks plays a man who never takes risks, and in death he is put on trial, literally, to defend whether he made enough progress to \u201cmove on\u201d or not. Meanwhile he has fallen in love in this afterlife realm with a character played by\u00a0 Meryl Streep who has been a real hero in her life so she will obviously graduate to a higher plane! I like the general question being posed by both of these, and Yeats\u2019 poem too. What is your life purpose? Why are YOU Here, in the largest sense, not just day to day?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>My notion is that we should not wait until we are elderly, or until we pass on, to ask ourselves what we would really like to be fulfilling NOW, with THIS life, whatever the afterlife might have in store. (And BTW, what might be fulfilling to one might be as simple as an act of kindness\u00a0 or learning to give love unconditionally.)\u00a0 Here and Now we do have some control over our conscious choices. For myself I intend to \u2018accomplish\u2019 all I can spiritually, and take that forward.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Do you have a Life Dream?

Punishing your child uselessly may have a negative impact on his abilities.</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n", "post_id": 2220, "location": false, "date": "01-10-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<div class=\"wpcom-reblog-snapshot\"> <div class=\"reblog-post\"><p class=\"reblog-from\"><img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d2916b8e2c710b2551c0de74918d9b06?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />Originally posted on <a href=\"http://outnumberedmumma.wordpress.com/2014/01/10/reliving-my-bookworm-childhood-through-my-bookworm-children/\">Outnumbered Mumma</a>:</p><div class=\"reblogged-content\">\n<p>The feeling that comes over me when I catch a glimpse of a book from my childhood is almost embarrassing.

4 years love me reading this book to them, It is a very easy to read book, and very easy to understand The children also love all the pictures of the animals especially the monkey on Mind your P&#8217;S and Q&#8217;S On page 17. A book you can just pick up and read for whatever length of time you have eg 10mins.

style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Question:\u00a0Should I Give in and Buy My Kids Designer Labels?</strong></span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0parents \u00a0are asking \u00a0if \u00a0they should go ahead and buy expensive, designer labels for their kids. A lot of kids are very specific about they labels they ask for and many parents, especially in this economy are wondering if it&#8217;s worth it and how they should teach their kids about quality and value. I&#8217;ve got a few hints that can help.</strong></span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Answer:\u00a0The answer is, there is no right answer. Every family is different, and so is every kid&#8217;s environment. Though we might not remember what it was like to be in school, our kids are reminded of it every day. And every school is different. In some schools, kids take fashion and labels very seriously, while in others there is much less emphasis on brand names. But I can promise you there is pressure on kids in every school or club to look a certain way.\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>And as much as I&#8217;d like to say it isn&#8217;t so. Often, especially for tweens and young teens, fashion is all about the label. It&#8217;s their way of fitting in, expressing themselves and aligning themselves with certain groups. As adults, this doesn&#8217;t always make sense to us, but to them it&#8217;s dead serious.\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>So what&#8217;s a parent to do?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Well, like with all things, deciding on whether or not to buy an expensive fashion item is all about balance and understanding. First off, talk to your kids about how having designer labels does not define them or make them better people. Explain to them the importance of thinking for themselves. Then find out exactly what items are most important on your child&#8217;s list and work with your child to make the decision about whether or not the purchase makes sense for your family.\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Is your child willing to make sacrifices?\u00a0Talk to your kids about your family&#8217;s budget for kids&#8217; clothes. Is there wiggle room to get your daughter those Uggs she wants if the rest of her clothes come from the Gap and Old Navy sale racks? Is she willing to make that sacrifice? Explain to her that having a budget for clothing means making informed decisions on what items to splurge on and what items to save on. If you can take from her t-shirt budget and add to her footwear budget, she&#8217;s just learned to make an educated decision.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Is it the look or the label?\u00a0How important is it that your child gets the exact label he&#8217;s asking for? Will a similar item from a less expensive store do? Sometimes it will and sometimes it won&#8217;t. For certain kids&#8217; fashion items, the label is the most important part of the look&#8211;unfortunate but true.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Does your child have an allowance?\u00a0Is he willing to put some of his own money towards the purchase of the sought-after item? If so, consider working with him on purchasing the item. If he&#8217;s not willing to spend any of his own money, but still says he wants the expensive item, maybe he&#8217;s not ready for the responsibility of owning costly things.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Will your child care for the item?\u00a0Is your child responsible enough to take extra care of an item that you spend more money than usual on? This is a big factor in deciding whether or not she&#8217;s ready to own nicer clothes and accessories.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Can it be a gift?\u00a0Splurge fashion items make great gifts for kids and tweens. She&#8217;ll love it even more if she&#8217;s been pining for it for ages.\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Younger kids, who don&#8217;t understand how much different items cost, could benefit from games that teach kids the value of money.

Rob Griffin looks at the risks you run if you do.</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>If you have children then the chances are you will face a big dilemma when it comes to booking your summer break: do you pay sky-high prices to go away during the school holidays or risk incurring the headmaster&#8217;s wrath by flying off in term-time?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>It&#8217;s a question that&#8217;s debated in thousands of households every year. Not only are the costs involved so much higher during peak times of the year \u2013 particularly August and over Christmas \u2013 but holiday destinations are also packed to capacity.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Research undertaken by travelsupermarket.com found that 31% of parents would allow their children to miss school to go on holiday, with one-in-five parents admitting that being fined for allowing taking their children out of the classroom wouldn&#8217;t put them off holidaying outside of half-term, Easter or the summer and Christmas break</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"></div>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>And when you consider the additional cost of holidaying when the schools are closed, you can understand why. According to Abbey, foreign holiday packages cost an average of 25% more in mid-August compared to mid-July. This rises to 40% for countries such as Portugal, but even UK resorts can increase in cost by an average of 39%.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u201cAt the moment, every penny counts, and the potential savings families can make by nipping off on holiday a few days before the end of term is too much of a temptation for many parents,\u201d says Bob Atkinson, travel expert at travelsupermarket.com.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Abbey also reports that, once school starts again in September, prices for holidays abroad drop by an average of 32% while UK breaks fall by more than 50%. \u2028\u2028</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>This doesn&#8217;t come as a surprise to Darren Cronian, editor of the campaigning consumer affairs website Travel-rants.com. Angry parents juggling their finances and holiday dates are among his most regular visitors.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>&#8220;It&#8217;s a popular &#8216;rant&#8217; among consumers that hits my inbox,&#8221; he says. &#8220;They feel hard done by because they are forced to book during the school holidays &#8211; unless they want to receive a fine or be prosecuted.&#8221;</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Travel companies, he believes, should do more to help. &#8220;In my opinion they take advantage of the situation,&#8221; he says. &#8220;They say it&#8217;s a part of business \u2013 supply and demand. The reason the demand is there because it&#8217;s forced upon parents to book during July and August when the schools are closed.&#8221;</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>That&#8217;s not fair, argues Frances Tuke, spokesperson for the Association of British Travel Agents. Companies are not simply profiteering \u2013 in fact they would prefer to have a steady flow of business throughout the year but this is impossible. &#8220;The summer is when the holiday industry makes its money to and this helps compensate for other times of the year when they suffer losses,&#8221; she explains.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>&#8220;By making prices cheaper during the quieter times it encourages people who can take holidays to go away so less head off during peak times.&#8221;</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>So where does that leave parents? Well the stark choice is to pay the inflated prices or go on holiday during term-time. Even heading off just a couple of days early can make a huge difference to the price paid. But this is where it gets tricky. Parents don&#8217;t have an automatic right to remove their children from school for holidays, but they can apply for permission, according to the Department for Children, Schools and Families.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Under the Education (Pupil Registration) Regulations 1995, schools have the discretion to grant leave of absence for up to 10 days per school year for such breaks during term time. However, this must be applied for well in advance and the decision to authorise absence for holidays rests entirely with the school.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>&#8220;Parents need to recognise that even just a couple of days of holiday can have a negative impact on their child&#8217;s progress,&#8221; says a spokesperson for the DCFS. &#8220;We obviously sympathise with the financial pressures on parents but no holiday is worth harming a child&#8217;s education.&#8221;</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>This means the request can be turned down. Parents who still fly off in defiance of this decision will have their child&#8217;s absence marked down as &#8216;unauthorised&#8217; and may have to pay a hefty price for their stance. Penalties of \u00a350 to \u00a3100 can be levied \u2013 and if these aren&#8217;t paid then the fine can rise to \u00a32,500. Prosecution through the courts, which could end up with a jail sentence of three months, are also an option in more extreme cases.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Devon County Council, meanwhile, warns parents on its website that children who are taken out\u2013 unauthorised \u2013 for four weeks or more may find they lose their place at the school\u2026without any guarantee of getting it back. Government officials insist that such draconian measures are only used as a last resort against parents.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>&#8220;The action on unauthorised absence is discretionary and according to a Local Authority&#8217;s code of practice, which means they can choose to issue penalty notices or parents could face prosecution,&#8221; explained the DCFS spokesperson. &#8220;However, this can only be done by Local Authorities. The point is there are a lot of measures to be exhausted before things go this far and all cases are judged on an individual basis.&#8221;</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Despite the risks, the statistics show that plenty of parents do believe it&#8217;s a risk they need to take in order to either lower the cost of a break or fit in with the holiday dates of other family members.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>During the Autumn 2006 and Spring 2007 terms, for example, family holidays accounted for 5.4m lost days, according to the DCFS. Of these, more than 530,000 were unauthorised. And when hard-pressed families can save more than \u00a31,000 on the cost of a break away, the risk of being hit with a fine of up to \u00a3100 certainly seems to be a chance worth taking.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Mum-of-three Sue Santoro, 42, has taken her children \u2013 twin eight year-old boys Matthew and Daniel, and 10-year-old Alex &#8211; out for a couple of days and understands why parents are attracted to term time holidays. &#8220;A lot of schools seem to be more sympathetic if it&#8217;s either end of the term \u2013 as long as you avoid exam times,&#8221; she says.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>&#8220;You can see where parents are coming from when prices double or treble two or three days into the school holidays. Depending on what you&#8217;re doing it can sometimes be just as educational as being in the classroom.&#8221;</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>So how can you improve your chances of gaining approval from the school?</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Your child&#8217;s head teacher will consider a number of factors in reaching their decision: the time and duration of the leave being requested; the child&#8217;s attendance record; and the learning that will be missed during the break.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Schools may be more amenable if you can demonstrate that the trip will be educational. A once-in-a-lifetime trip to the wilds of Kenya, for example, will have more chance of gaining approval than a week&#8217;s fun at Butlins.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>It also makes sense not to go during the first year of a new school and when examinations are due to be sat. The run-up to GCSE exams \u2013 both the mocks and the real thing \u2013 are best avoided as well. Kayte Williams, holidays channel manager at Travelsupermarket.com, points out that huge savings can be made on the cost of a holiday simply by getting a couple of days off at either the beginning or end of a term.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>&#8220;It has to be put in proportion depending on the age of the child and what school term they are in,&#8221; she says. &#8220;If they&#8217;re in the middle of exams then it obviously is not a good idea to take them out. It all comes down to common sense striking a balance.&#8221;</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Even if you decide to stick to the rules there are other ways to save money. First on the agenda is travel insurance. While it&#8217;s an essential item to pack, it&#8217;s important not to buy the first one you are offered, according to Peter Gerrard of Moneysupermarket.com.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>&#8220;Don&#8217;t automatically buy the policy being offered by your travel agent because you could end up paying five times more,&#8221; he says. &#8220;It&#8217;s also worth checking to see if your children can be added to the policy free of charge as many insurers allow this.&#8221;</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>As well as looking around for the best deals, it&#8217;s also worth considering an annual policy if you are planning on making more than one trip abroad. Other tips that can save you cash include traveling at unsociable times, opting to leave via one of the regional airports, building your own holiday by booking flights and accommodation separately and just haggling with the tour operators to get the best possible deal.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Taking a close look at the small print of holiday brochures to ensure you&#8217;re not going to be stung by an array of hidden costs can also make sense.

But do they live up to their healthy image? Most energy drinks provide a combination of fast and slow-acting sugars and uplifting ingredients such as caffeine and herbs. But experts are concerned the stimulants are too potent.</p>\n<p>Red Bull, a popular energy drinks with trendy young clubbers and sports enthusiasts, is under investigation in Sweden after reports that three people died after drinking it. The recommendation from the Swedish authorities is that you should not mix it with alcohol or drink it after exercise because too much caffeine may lead to thickening of the arteries in susceptible people.</p>\n<p>Trendy energy drinks should not be confused with specialist sports drinks. Most of these are labelled isotonic &#8211; they have the same concentration of dissolved particles as body fluids, are easily absorbed and increase the rate at which water is delivered to the body. But even these are not necessary for the average gym user.</p>\n<p>&#8216;If you only want to replace fluid lost in sweat during exercise of a short duration, water or fruit juice does the job equally well,&#8217; says Professor Ron Maughan, nutrition adviser to Britain&#8217;s Olympic team.</p>\n<p>So what is the best way to boost your energy from a can?</p>\n<p><b>We assess the good (and bad) points of the top-selling revitalisers and give each a health rating out of five.</b></p>\n<p><b>Red Bull</b><br />\n{1}</p>\n<p><b>Claims:</b>\u00a0&#8216;Vitalises body and mind, stimulates metabolism, increases endurance and improves concentration.&#8217;</p>\n<p><b>Contains:</b>\u00a0Taurine, caffeine, B vitamins.</p>\n<p><b>Verdict:</b>\u00a0Equivalent of a strong cup of filter coffee. Banned in Canada because caffeine levels deemed too high, sold only in pharmacies in Norway, Denmark and France. British Advertising Standards Authority rejected claims it boosts concentration, reaction time and endurance as up to four cans needed to enhance physical or mental performance in set tasks.<br />\n<b>Health rating:</b>\u00a01/5</p>\n<p><b>Liptovan B3</b><br />\n{2}</p>\n<p><b>Claims:</b>\u00a0&#8216;World&#8217;s original energy drink since 1962.&#8217;</p>\n<p><b>Contains:</b>\u00a0Royal jelly, taurine and multi-vitamins &#8216;for a natural lift&#8217;.</p>\n<p><b>Verdict:</b>\u00a0Taurine, a non- essential amino acid from ox bile, is important in the metabolising of fats. Supposedly helps fight fatigue by interfering with brain&#8217;s production of the sleep-inducing chemical, serotonin. Like too much caffeine, it can raise heart rate, putting susceptible people at risk. Contains no more caffeine than cup of coffee. Better off with fresh orange juice, which contains energy-boosting carbohydrate.</p>\n<p><b>Health rating:</b>\u00a02/5</p>\n<p><b>Lucozade Solstis</b><br />\n{3}</p>\n<p><b>Claims:</b>\u00a0&#8216;The combination of fast-acting glucose and caffeine is designed to boost alertness quickly.&#8217;</p>\n<p><b>Contains:</b>\u00a0Guarana, taurine, caffeine and &#8216;vital energy-releasing vitamins&#8217;.</p>\n<p><b>Verdict:</b>\u00a0Contains not much more caffeine than a cup of coffee. Still, a high overall intake of caffeine will stimulate the heart and central nervous system, and can sometimes cause palpitations in susceptible people.</p>\n<p>In high doses, caffeine acts as a diuretic so a drink could promote dehydration rather than prevent it. Solstis was one of the drinks criticised by Dr Graham Chadwick of Dundee University&#8217;s dental school.</p>\n<p>He carried out tests to see if energy drinks are a greater threat to teeth than ordinary soft drinks. The acidic properties of Red Bull and Lucozade&#8217;s Solstis, says Chadwick, can erode the enamel coating that protects the sensitive inner layer of dentine inside the tooth.</p>\n<p><b>Health rating:</b>\u00a01/5</p>\n<p><b>Isostar</b><br />\n{4}</p>\n<p><b>Claims:</b>\u00a0Boosts mental as well as physical power during exercise.</p>\n<p><b>Contains:</b>\u00a0Activator complex, which includes caffeine, vitamin C, taurine.<br />\n<b>Verdict:\u00a0</b>Isotonic drink which, it is claimed, will boost your reaction time and powers of thinking as well as your endurance while you play sport, due to a &#8216;unique mix of stimulating and energy-boosting ingredients&#8217;.</p>\n<p>Independent one-hour test showed athletes drinking Isostar with activator complex scored 20 pc better on concentration skills than those who drank other isotonic drinks.</p>\n<p>Like many other sports drinks, its carbohydrate sources are sucrose and maltodextrins. It is also available as a powder. The downside is that it contains caffeine, which is unnecessary in a sports drink.</p>\n<p><b>Health rating:</b>\u00a04/5</p>\n<p><b>Purdey&#8217;s Active Body</b>{5}</p>\n<p><b>Claims:</b>\u00a0&#8216;Provides a sustained energy boost at work or play.&#8217;</p>\n<p><b>Contains:</b>\u00a0Fruit juices and &#8216;botanical extracts&#8217; (ginseng, bayberry bark, prickly ash bark), vitamins.</p>\n<p><b>Verdict:</b>\u00a0Very sweet-tasting drink with apple juice concentrate and added sugars.You would get no more of an energy jolt with this than from a can of cola. Far healthier to stick to fruit juice and a bagel.</p>\n<p>According to nutrition scientist Claire McEvilly, of the British Nutrition Foundation, there is no scientific evidence that bayberry bark and prickly ash bark have any effect on energy levels. &#8216;It is unwise to consume herbs if you are on medication,&#8217; she says.

Many children will stop using a dummy by themselves.\u00a0</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Choose your timing. A period of change or stress for you or your child might not be a good time to give up.\u00a0</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Talk to your child about giving up the dummy, if your child is old enough to understand.\u00a0</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>When you and your child are ready, begin by restricting dummy use to certain times and places, such as in the car or cot.

It happens every time a new report of a child abduction reaches our eyes or ears. Parents in all corners of the world are wondering&#8211; what can I do to keep my children safe at a time in history where child abduction seems like a regular occurrence?</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>What do I say to my child? How can I make him recognize danger? What words will get through to her? What exactly do I say when I sit him down for this important conversation?</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Yes, what you say to your children about this important issue is critical. What you talk to your children about and how you talk to them are essential steps in preparing them to stay firmly on the path of safety. Below you will find valuable suggestions for how and when to communicate with your children to ensure you meet your most important parenting responsibility&#8211;keeping your children safe.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>1. Do not view the role of helping your child learn about the dangers of being lost, taken, or abused as a one-time occurrence. A thorough initial discussion is just that&#8211;an initial discussion. This topic will need to be revisited by you and your children many times. Look for opportunities to examine this topic from different perspectives.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>2. Make sure your children know that if they are lost or taken you will look for them forever and search until they are found. Reassure them frequently of your love and of your desire to have them in your life. Let them know that you love them no matter what they say or do and that you will always be there for them and work to keep them safe and healthy.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>3. Remind your children that the world is a place where most people love children and helpers are everywhere. When you are at the mall or grocery store, point out the people who are likely to help: a woman at the door, a grandmother, a person at the information center. Statistics indicate that women are more likely to take a child who needs help to the appropriate person. A man will often point the child in the right direction but let them navigate the route on their own.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>4. Do not use the &#8220;never talk to strangers&#8221; slogan. If your child is lost at an amusement park or mall, everyone around them could be a stranger. If they can&#8217;t talk to strangers, who do they turn to? Instead, teach your children how to recognize the people who are most likely to help. That person just might be a stranger.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>5. When you see a situation that is potentially unsafe, point it out to your children. Talk about what is unsafe about it and what could be done to make it safe. Tell them why you parked under the light in the parking lot as night approached. Explain why you moved away from the curb as you walked along the sidewalk on a busy or icy street. Talk about why it is not safe to help someone find their lost dog or cat.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>6. Do not teach your child that please is the magic word. &#8220;Say the magic word and I&#8217;ll give you more ice cream&#8221; some parents tell their children. Guess what? Child abductors use the magic word, too. They can be extremely polite until they achieve their prime objective.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>7. Teach your child the danger signal of people bearing gifts. Ice cream, candy and video games are good bribes. Help your child see them as warning signs.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>8. Let your children know that there is a time to be polite to an adult and a time not to be polite. Talk about how to fight back by kicking, scratching and biting. Teach them to make themselves big by holding onto something else if someone tries to take them. Tell them that it is okay to scream, &#8220;This is not my daddy! Help!&#8221; when an adult grabs them. Practice this strategy by role-playing it with your children.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>9. Teach your children to give it the &#8220;tummy test.&#8221; If it feels unsafe or scary in their tummy, teach them to run. Logic is not important here. Intuition and inner knowing is. Help your children develop that wise part within. Teach them to trust it.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>10. Teach your child to be assertive. If an adult is invading their space or saying something that is bringing up uncomfortable feelings, teach your children to speak up. Give them the words to use. &#8220;Leave me alone&#8221; or &#8220;Stay away from me&#8221; work well in these situations.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>11. Create a code word to be used anytime you have asked someone other than immediate family to pick up or transport your children. There may be times when you cannot get to school, baseball practice, or the church function. If the person who tells your child he or she is there to pick them up doesn&#8217;t know the code word, teach your child to immediately tell another adult whom they trust.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>12. Use your words to paint a picture of hope rather than fear. We want our children to see that safety exists all around them. When children see the world as safe instead of scary, they are better able to sense an unsafe situation when one arises. If everything is seen as scary, rotten, or hurtful, then the next scary incident that comes along is just like all the others and seems normal.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Your number-one job as a parent is to keep your children safe and healthy. That involves teaching them to protect themselves from the potential dangers that exist in our world. Use the suggestions above to arm your children with strategies that can help them take care of themselves.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">HOW DO YOU KEEP YOUR KIDS \u00a0SAFE</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">WHAT DO YOU THINK SEND A COMMENT ?</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n", "post_id": 2282, "location": false, "date": "02-15-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners animals aviation books breakfast cars children climate cooking dessert FAMILY food frog gaming Gillian Sims good manners health home kids lifestyle lite", "keeping safe"], "text": "<h3 style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>This poem talks about children growing up and how we often miss it if we don&#8217;t watch really closely.</strong></span></h3>\n<h1 style=\"text-align:center;\"></h1>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><a href=\"http://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/faces.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2286\" alt=\"faces\" src=\"https://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/faces.jpg?w=160&#038;h=88\" width=\"160\" height=\"88\" /></a></strong></span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>When you see a smiling face</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Their happiness all over the place</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Singing, laughing, cries of glee,</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Come they say, Play with me</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>The slide, the swing, the monkey bars.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Look at them close to see who they are.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Lots of races, Ready, Set, Go.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>This is how the children grow.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>If you watch them everyday</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>You&#8217;ll see they learn as they play</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>They&#8217;ll do what they see, and say what they hear.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>You&#8217;re their teacher though out the years.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Their ideas and thoughts in their eyes shine.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Imagination is a glimpse of their mind</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>When you\u2019re not looking, don&#8217;t you know</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>This is when the children grow.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Watch them as they learn to walk</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Listen to them when they talk</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Keep them safe, away from harm</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Wrap them gently within your arms</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Teach them to share and how to take turns.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Set good examples from which they will learn.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>At home, at school, wherever they go</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>This is where the children grow.</strong></span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a9 Christy R.

can ever have in\u00a0the form\u00a0of pets. \u00a0Take a look here at which are the best dogs for\u00a0children.</p>\n<p>When you have a child in the house, it\u2019s always great to have a dog! \u00a0Of course when you are looking for the best dogs for\u00a0children, some breeds will adapt\u00a0very well\u00a0around kids compared to others. \u00a0Having dogs when you have toddlers in the house gives your kids safety as well as bringing lots of fun and play to your household! Dogs usually love kids and treat them just like their own and are usually much more affectionate and caring towards them, than their owners.</p>\n<p>Of course the whole point of having a family dog, is to give the family a sense of security, some fun and even a bit of\u00a0exercise\u00a0on daily walks, and in turn, owners give their dogs a loving home to stay in. Find out which are the best dogs for\u00a0children\u00a0below.</p>\n<p><strong>Best Dogs for\u00a0Children\u00a0and Families</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dogcentral.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/dogs-kids-2.jpg\"><img title=\"dogs-kids-2\" alt=\"dogs kids 2 Best Dogs for Children\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dogcentral.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/dogs-kids-2.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"516\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dogcentral.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/dogs-kids-3.jpg\"><img title=\"dogs-kids-3\" alt=\"dogs kids 3 Best Dogs for Children\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dogcentral.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/dogs-kids-3.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"421\" /></a></p>\n<p>There are a few characteristics which these types of dogs should have, to be around\u00a0children. Having a dog when you have toddlers around is a fun thing, but you also have to take care of them in many ways. You have to make sure, the dog breeds are not violent, aggressive or rough around the\u00a0children, as this of course can be harmful.</p>\n<p>It is also better to ensure that the dog\u2019s\u00a0shedding\u00a0habits around the kitchen and the kids, (since, kids need very hygienic conditions in the earlier years) are kept to the garden. Given below are a few names of the best dogs\u00a0for kids, so have a look which one you might prefer the best and I do hope that it will help you choose the perfect dog for many years to come.. \u00a0Also feel free to comment at the bottom\u2026.</p>\n<h4><strong>Golden and Labrador Retriever</strong>:</h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dogcentral.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/dogs-kids-1.jpg\"><img title=\"dogs-kids-1\" alt=\"dogs kids 1 Best Dogs for Children\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dogcentral.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/dogs-kids-1.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" /></a></p>\n<p>Labrador Retrievers are very attractive and look very adorable. They are usually great with kids and have a pleasant personality around families. \u00a0They enjoy playing and love walks. \u00a0An ideal family dog and just one of the best dog breeds for\u00a0children\u00a0you could have\u2026 \u00a0As Labradors are very affectionate and also intelligent they can also be one of the best dogs for\u00a0childrenwith autism too. \u00a0 But that\u2019s not all.. \u00a0We also have\u2026.</p>\n<h4><strong>Bichon Frise</strong>:</h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dogcentral.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/dogs-kids-4.jpg\"><img title=\"dogs-kids-4\" alt=\"dogs kids 4 Best Dogs for Children\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dogcentral.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/dogs-kids-4.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a></p>\n<p>These little dogs could be mistook for cotton balls, as they are tiny and soft. Bichon Frises love to play and are very active around babies. \u00a0Another one to consider when looking for the best dogs\u00a0for kids..</p>\n<h4>Beagles</h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dogcentral.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/dogs-kids-5.jpg\"><img title=\"dogs-kids-5\" alt=\"dogs kids 5 Best Dogs for Children\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dogcentral.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/dogs-kids-5.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"512\" /></a></p>\n<div></div>\n<p>These dogs are just like Retrievers, only smaller in size and kinda cuter to look at. \u00a0Beagles are friendly and loving in nature and are very suitable for little\u00a0children. They respond\u00a0very well\u00a0to training too. \u00a0This breed of dog will bring fun to any family with\u00a0children.</p>\n<h4><strong>Pembroke Welsh Corgi</strong></h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dogcentral.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/dogs-kids-6.jpg\"><img title=\"dogs-kids-6\" alt=\"dogs kids 6 Best Dogs for Children\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dogcentral.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/dogs-kids-6.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"512\" /></a></p>\n<p>This is definitely one of the most popular pets in families and holds his place in the best dogs for\u00a0children. They are short tailed, stocky dogs who just love romping with kids of between 6 to 7 years.</p>\n<h4><strong>Dalmatian</strong></h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dogcentral.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/dogs-kids-7.jpg\"><img title=\"dogs-kids-7\" alt=\"dogs kids 7 Best Dogs for Children\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dogcentral.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/dogs-kids-7.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a></p>\n<p>This black and white spotted guy may look bigger than those tiny toddlers of yours, but are never a threat around them. \u00a0Dalmatians are pure lovers of human beings and can be the most trusted friends for their families. With all that energy inside them, they are one of the easiest dog breeds to have fun with!</p>\n<h4><strong>Basset Hound</strong></h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dogcentral.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/dogs-kids-8.jpg\"><img title=\"dogs-kids-8\" alt=\"dogs kids 8 Best Dogs for Children\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dogcentral.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/dogs-kids-8.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"720\" /></a></p>\n<p>A Basset Hound is also a great pick for\u00a0children. They are very gentle, a bit dopey and sweet by nature but could get stubborn at times. They love\u00a0children\u00a0of all ages and can\u2019t help getting their attention. They are also one of the best dogs for\u00a0children\u00a0that don\u2019t shed and so they are probably one of the best dogs for\u00a0children\u00a0with allergies.</p>\n<h4><strong>German Shepherd</strong></h4>\n<p><strong></strong><a href=\"http://www.dogcentral.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/dogs-kids-9.jpg\"><img title=\"dogs-kids-9\" alt=\"dogs kids 9 Best Dogs for Children\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dogcentral.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/dogs-kids-9.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"464\" /></a><strong><br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>This is yet another breed we recommend in our list, a breed which is not only loyal but also extremely protective about\u00a0children. If they are well trained, you don\u2019t need to bother about leaving your kids alone with them anytime. They have a very playful nature especially around kids of a younger ages.</p>\n<h4><strong>Collies</strong></h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dogcentral.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/dogs-kids-10.jpg\"><img title=\"dogs-kids-10\" alt=\"dogs kids 10 Best Dogs for Children\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dogcentral.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/dogs-kids-10.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a></p>\n<p>How could we not mention Collies? They are the most perfect dogs that a family could ask for. They are gentle, predictable and easy to train, along with being the most easiest around\u00a0children. They are also very protective about the families and love to play with kids of absolutely all ages.</p>\n<p><strong>Mixed-Breed Dogs</strong>:</p>\n<p>There are many other dogs which are mix breeds and also make the most adorable family dogs one could have. \u00a0They are gentle, mostly quiet, protective and loyal and having them in the family is always great and thus, they are also the best dogs\u00a0for kids. You can blindly trust many of the mix-bread dogs around your\u00a0children\u00a0anytime, but make sure you train them first.</p>\n<p>With those\u00a0beautiful\u00a0animals to have around the house, I am sure you must now have a good idea about\u00a0choices\u00a0for the best dogs for your\u00a0children. You can always trust these dog breeds, as they will never give up on their families and they will soon become great buddies to you and your family for a long time!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/love-dog.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-2305\" alt=\"love dog\" src=\"https://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/love-dog.jpg?w=150&#038;h=150\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-2305\" alt=\"love dog\" src=\"https://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/love-dog.jpg?w=150&#038;h=150\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><a href=\"http://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/love-dog.jpg\"><img class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-2305 alignnone\" alt=\"love dog\" src=\"https://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/love-dog.jpg?w=150&#038;h=150\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a></p>\n</div>\n", "post_id": 2303, "location": false, "date": "01-26-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners animals aviation books breakfast cars children climate cooking dessert FAMILY food frog gaming Gillian Sims good manners health home kid", "DOG"], "text": "<h2 style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/dog-and-me.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2309\" alt=\"dog and me\" src=\"https://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/dog-and-me.jpg?w=274&#038;h=184\" width=\"274\" height=\"184\" /></a></h2>\n<div>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>I only have a group of three,\u00a0</strong></span><br /><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>me, my dog, my dog and me</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>It&#8217;s a lonely way to be,\u00a0</strong></span><br /><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>me, my dog, my dog and me</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>We are a safe with no key,\u00a0</strong></span><br /><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>me, my dog, my dog and me</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Three to talk to two to see,\u00a0</strong></span><br /><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>me, my dog, my dog, and me\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Emily Guthrie</strong></span></div>\n</div>\n", "post_id": 2308, "location": false, "date": "01-26-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Gillian Sims", "allaboutmanners.wordpress.com", "motherhood", "Yahoo", "parenting", "toddler tantrum", "temper tantrums"], "text": "<h1><span style=\"color:#088290;\"><span style=\"font-family:arial;\"><span style=\"font-size:x-large;\">Toddler temper tantrums: How I learned to stay stress free</span></span></span></h1>\n<p><span style=\"color:#1f1f1f;\"><span style=\"font-family:arial;\"><span style=\"font-size:small;\">Picture the scene, it&#8217;s a beautiful day, you&#8217;re at your favourite restaurant about to sit down to a fabulous Sunday lunch, when suddenly all hell breaks loose.</span></span></span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/l2.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/i0WlrN5bSeHTm9aUIwAHRw--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7cT04NTt3PTYzMA--/http://l.yimg.com/os/401/2012/11/09/toddler-tantrum-jpg_171035.jpg\" width=\"630\" height=\"380\" /><span style=\"color:#414141;\"><span style=\"font-family:arial;\"><span style=\"font-size:small;\">How many times have your meals out been ruined by a toddler tantrum?</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#1f1f1f;\"><span style=\"font-family:arial;\"><span style=\"font-size:small;\">I had my first experience of the &#8216;terrible twos&#8217; one beautiful Sunday afternoon. We had attended our favourite family restaurant for Sunday lunch. My daughter, Tilly, was sitting between us in her high chair. The menu looked mouth-watering and everything was dandy. Then suddenly the crystal clear wine glasses began to vibrate over the crisp white table linen and knives and forks started to shake. At first I thought it was an earthquake. But it was far worst. Tilly was having a tantrum.</span></span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#088290;\"><span style=\"font-family:arial;\"><span style=\"font-size:small;\"><br />\n[Related:\u00a0</span></span></span></strong><strong><a href=\"http://uk.lifestyle.yahoo.com/helped-two-old-over-shyness-163500470.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color:#088290;\"><span style=\"font-family:arial;\"><span style=\"font-size:small;\">How I help my two year old get over shyness</span></span></span></a></strong><strong><span style=\"color:#088290;\"><span style=\"font-family:arial;\"><span style=\"font-size:small;\">]</span></span></span></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#1f1f1f;\"><span style=\"font-family:arial;\"><span style=\"font-size:small;\">With her tiny little feet she kicked the table from underneath. She then tried to break free from her chair. Then came the screaming, causing all eyes to turn on us. &#8220;I want daddy&#8221; she screamed. Thinking this would calm her, I took her out of the chair and handed her to daddy. The wailing stopped for exactly six seconds before she once again tried to break free. &#8220;I want to get down,&#8221; she wailed. Threats like &#8220;If you don&#8217;t behave we&#8217;re going home&#8221; fell on deaf ears. By now the tantrum was in full swing.</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#1f1f1f;\"><span style=\"font-family:arial;\"><span style=\"font-size:small;\">We were attracting more attention than Joan Collins. I couldn&#8217;t understand it. She wasn&#8217;t even two. It wasn&#8217;t fair. I felt cheated. My daughter was only 22 months. Had she begun the terrible twos early, like some kind of early menopause syndrome?</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#1f1f1f;\"><span style=\"font-family:arial;\"><span style=\"font-size:small;\">A bemused waiter came to take our order. &#8220;What would you like?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Just our coats,&#8221; I replied. Yes, it was time to leave.</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#1f1f1f;\"><span style=\"font-family:arial;\"><span style=\"font-size:small;\">We suffered the terrible twos for quite some time. My daughter did not mind where she had a tantrum. There seemed to be no rhyme or reason to it.</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#1f1f1f;\"><span style=\"font-family:arial;\"><span style=\"font-size:small;\">Rather than let it spoil our time, I thought up different ways to deal with the situation so that when a tantrum struck, I was armed and ready. I even gave it a name: &#8216;Tantrum Tamer&#8217;. It worked most of the time, which was definitely better than none of the time. More importantly &#8211; it got us through. Here&#8217;s how I coped.</span></span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#088290;\"><span style=\"font-family:arial;\"><span style=\"font-size:small;\"><br />\n[Related:\u00a0</span></span></span></strong><strong><a href=\"http://uk.lifestyle.yahoo.com/how-to-switch-off-the-water-works.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color:#088290;\"><span style=\"font-family:arial;\"><span style=\"font-size:small;\">How to switch off the waterworks</span></span></span></a></strong><strong><span style=\"color:#088290;\"><span style=\"font-family:arial;\"><span style=\"font-size:small;\">]</span></span></span></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#1f1f1f;\"><span style=\"font-family:arial;\"><span style=\"font-size:small;\">Whenever a tantrum struck I would go through a series of five stages with my daughter:</span></span></span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/l3.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/ZkcqBHd6Pw5.KAzKBg87yA--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7cT04NTt3PTMxNQ--/http://l.yimg.com/os/401/2012/11/09/toddler-tantrum-1-jpg_172522.jpg\" width=\"315\" height=\"400\" /><span style=\"color:#414141;\"><span style=\"font-family:arial;\"><span style=\"font-size:small;\">Physical contact and understand helps with toddler tantrums</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#1f1f1f;\"><span style=\"font-family:arial;\"><span style=\"font-size:small;\">1. Even if my daughter was screaming at the top of her voice and showing no signs of listening, I would get down to her level so we were face to face. I would explain in a low calm voice that I understood that she was feeling upset. I would then say that if we both took a deep breath together we would start to feel better.</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#1f1f1f;\"><span style=\"font-family:arial;\"><span style=\"font-size:small;\">2. I soon discovered that if I made things more child friendly and more like a game, I got better results. Hence the name &#8216;Tantrum Tamer&#8217;. I would say to my daughter, &#8220;Shall we try the Tantrum Tamer?&#8221; This consisted of a series of actions, starting with a hug. For me this was twofold. If she was totally running wild I could restrain her. Secondly, children quite often respond to touch.</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#1f1f1f;\"><span style=\"font-family:arial;\"><span style=\"font-size:small;\">Next we would breathe deeply. I would ask my daughter to take a deep breath in and then blow out with puffy cheek at least twice. It usually calmed me down, too. I would then tell my daughter the lovely warm feeling in her tummy was the Tantrum Tamer working. It would take a little time but would definitely work faster if she<strong><a href=\"http://uk.lifestyle.yahoo.com/how-to-amuse-toddlers-in-the-car.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color:#088290;\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><b>How to amuse toddlers in the car</b></span></span></a></strong> sat quietly.</span></span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#088290;\"><span style=\"font-family:arial;\"><span style=\"font-size:small;\"><br />\n[Related:\u00a0]</span></span></span></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#1f1f1f;\"><span style=\"font-family:arial;\"><span style=\"font-size:small;\">3. I would not only talk calmly to my daughter, but physically look and act calm so that she could see The Tamer was beginning to work. I would smile widely, and say things like &#8220;I feel so happy&#8221; or &#8220;I&#8217;m ready for a nice nap&#8221;. Anything my daughter would respond to.</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#1f1f1f;\"><span style=\"font-family:arial;\"><span style=\"font-size:small;\">4. If all of the above failed, I felt it was time for more drastic measures such as taking away a treat. I would say that she would not be able to go to the park until she was better behaved. If you decide to try this, you need to use your judgement on what penalty will work best for you and your child at that moment. The thing to remember is that this is the last warning.</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#1f1f1f;\"><span style=\"font-family:arial;\"><span style=\"font-size:small;\">5. Stick to your guns. If things are not better at this stage then you must carry out the penalty. Don&#8217;t be hoodwinked into giving another chance because this will only come back to bite you next time.</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#1f1f1f;\"><span style=\"font-family:arial;\"><span style=\"font-size:small;\">For me the terrible twos were a huge learning curve. Although I feel grateful for the experience, I have to admit that now that it&#8217;s over, I can breathe a sigh of relief &#8211; at least until the teenage years!</span></span></span></p>\n",

In extreme cases, some people have been known to walk out of the house and carry out complex activities, such as\u00a0driving a car.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>The person will usually have their eyes open while sleepwalking but will look straight through family members and not recognise them. However, they&#8217;re often able to manoeuvre around objects.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>If you talk to a person who is sleepwalking, they may partially respond or say things that don&#8217;t make sense.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Most sleepwalking episodes don&#8217;t last longer than 10 minutes. At the end of the episode, the person may wake up or they may return\u00a0to bed and\u00a0go back to sleep.\u00a0If woken while sleepwalking, the person will usually feel confused and won&#8217;t remember the episode.</strong></span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>What to do if you find someone sleepwalking</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>The best thing to do if you find someone sleepwalking is to make sure\u00a0they&#8217;re safe. Don&#8217;t shout or startle the person so that they wake up.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Gently guide them back to bed. If undisturbed, they&#8217;ll often go back to sleep again. Sometimes, gently waking the person fully (particularly children) when they appear to be coming out of the episode, before settling them back to sleep, will prevent another episode occurring from the same deep sleep cycle.</strong></span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Treating sleepwalking</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>There&#8217;s no specific treatment for sleepwalking, but it generally helps to try and get enough sleep and have a regular and relaxing routine before bedtime. Read more about\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/insomnia/Pages/bedtimeritual.aspx\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">how to establish a regular bedtime routine</span></a>.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>In adults,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/hypnotherapy/Pages/Introduction.aspx\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">hypnotherapy</span></a>\u00a0is sometimes effective in treating sleepwalking. If episodes are frequent, sleep studies may be needed to rule out other sleep disorders that could be triggering the behaviours, such as\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Sleep-apnoea/Pages/Introduction.aspx\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">obstructive sleep apnoea</span></a>(OSA) or periodic leg movements in sleep often associated with\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Restless-leg-syndrome/Pages/Introduction.aspx\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">restless leg syndrome</span></a>\u00a0(RLS).</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Medication isn&#8217;t usually used to treat sleepwalking. However, it may sometimes be recommended for a few nights when an increase in the frequency of episodes is anticipated, or if a person is sleeping in an unfamiliar environment. In some cases,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Antidepressant-drugs/Pages/Introduction.aspx\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">antidepressants</span></a>\u00a0may help reduce the frequency of sleepwalking episodes.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Occasional sleepwalking episodes don&#8217;t need further assessment. It&#8217;s only necessary to seek medical help if the number of sleepwalking episodes increases, or if the behaviours\u00a0lead to dangerous activities which risk\u00a0injury to the person sleepwalking or to others.</strong></span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Preventing accidents</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>It&#8217;s important to keep the areas of your home where a person may sleepwalk free of breakable\u00a0or potentially harmful objects, and to remove any items that they could trip over. It&#8217;s also a good idea to keep windows and doors locked.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>If your\u00a0child sleepwalks, don&#8217;t let\u00a0them\u00a0sleep on the top bed of a\u00a0bunk bed.

As with everything people say, there is usually some truth to it. We will go over the advantages and disadvantages of fast food in this article.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Most people eat fast food. Some eat it more often than others, and some like it more than others. Our taste buds tend to be different, so our opinions will vary from person to person. The following advantages and disadvantages are pretty standard and we have tried to be as unbiased as possible.</strong></span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Advantages of Fast Food</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>There are three main advantages to fast food.</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>You can save money because fast food tends to be cheaper than the alternatives.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>You can save time as there is very low or no waiting time for food to be served.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>There are many healthy fast food options now so no need to eat fat-filled burgers and fries.</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Save Money</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><img class=\"aligncenter\" alt=\"Advantages and Disadvantages of Fast Food\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/ffmp.fastfoodmenupric.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/advantages-disadvantages-300x242.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"242\" /></strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>This is probably the most important incentive for people to eat fast food. Fast food is usually much cheaper than homemade meals and dine-in restaurants. Because of that, it is the most common meal choice of lower class folks in our societies.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Having said that, fast food is eaten by almost everyone. Some of the most popular athletes in the world eat fast food. Even our president eats fast food here and there. It is definitely not limited to poor people, despite the way the media portrays it.</strong></span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Save Time</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>The second most obvious reason is because fast food is, well, fast. There is very low or no waiting period. Food is usually prepared in matter of minutes and you can be on your way.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Most fast food restaurants also have drive-thru\u2019s, which allow customers to order even more quickly. Now we don\u2019t even have to get out of our cars to purchase food. When compared to traditional restaurants, you could be saving over an hour of time from ordering to finishing your meal.</strong></span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Healthy Choices</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Although fast food has a reputation for being high in calories and fat, that is slowly changing with the rise of the health-conscious population, which is increasing the demand for\u00a0<a title=\"Healthy Fast Foods to Eat\" href=\"http://www.fastfoodmenuprices.com/healthy-fast-foods-to-eat/\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">healthy food options</span></a>.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Just about every fast food restaurant offers some kind of healthy alternatives today. Whether it\u2019s grilled chicken sandwiches, wraps, or salads, there is usually something for everyone.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>One thing to keep in mind is that healthier options generally tend to be a little more expensive. But because it is fast food, you are still going to save money over homemade foods.</strong></span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Disadvantages of Fast Food</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Fast food had many more disadvantages in the past couple of decades. Today, the industry is expanding into offering types of foods that cater to virtually anyone.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>There are two main disadvantages we\u2019ll take a look at:</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Lower quality foods that are usually caused by a large-scale production process.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>More fattening foods that are mainly caused by the lower quality food sources.</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Lower Quality Food</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>There\u2019s no doubt about it, fast food is made in a bulk production process, which tends to lower the overall quality of food. Granted, chicken is chicken, so we\u2019re not talking about eating rat meat here.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>A lot of the fast food restaurants such as\u00a0<a title=\"Chipotle Prices\" href=\"http://www.fastfoodmenuprices.com/chipotle-prices/\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Chipotle</span></a>\u00a0have started using organic vegetables, hormone-free beef, and cage-free chickens. This is greats news for both consumers and animals.</strong></span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">More Fattening</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Historically speaking, fast food has been very fattening. The production process involved in creating fast food added a lot of greasy and fat content to foods. However, as mentioned in the healthy choices section above, this is quickly changing.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>While most restaurants have your normal greasy burgers and fries, they have also started to offer grilled chicken, fish, salads, and healthy wraps. So whether you\u2019re looking to eat a nice greasy meal or a healthy grilled sandwich, fast food restaurants have what you want.</strong></span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Conclusion</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>As mentioned in this article, fast food restaurants and industry as a whole have come a long way.

I think for me (and probably most people), a grown-up is simply someone that\u2019s a certain amount older than you. When I started kindergarten, those fifth-graders in the back of the bus were sooo big. In middle school, it was the eighth-graders, and when I walked into high school as a freshman, the seniors seemed like they were part of another world. Of course, when I actually reached fifth, then eighth, then twelfth grade, I didn\u2019t feel very old.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>The same is still true. We\u2019re knocking on 30 here in the next couple years, which seemed like a lifetime away 10 years ago, but now that we\u2019re almost there, not so much. I guess, in a sense, it\u00a0<em>is</em>\u00a0a lifetime away, because we\u2019re really full-fledged adults now, and the things that we were worrying about in high school and college seem so trivial now. Which brings me back to my original question? Sure, we\u2019re adults now, but when do you start\u00a0<em>feeling</em>\u00a0it? I still feel like I\u2019m a kid (and if you ask S, perhaps I still am),\u00a0but heck \u2013 we have a kid of our own now, I\u2019ve had a full-time job for seven years, we own two homes, and nobody is responsible for us but ourselves. Somehow we made that transition relatively seamlessly and have managed to stay afloat.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>As we were talking about this, I had another realization \u2013 that even though I still feel a lot\u00a0like\u00a0a kid, there are still some aspects in which I wish we could be even\u00a0<em>more\u00a0</em>childlike. I watch C every day, and his joy and energy are infectious. Can he make me want to pull my hair out? Absolutely, and he seems to relish it.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>But mostly, he\u2019s just doing what he was born to do.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>He gets excited about the smallest things \u2013 snow, airplanes, balloons, seeing the dog every morning, Christmas lights, his stuffed monkey bath time; they all bring a smile and a \u201cwoooo\u201d sound of delight.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>His curiosity is boundless \u2013 he explores every path, tries new things daily, pushes the limits that we set for him.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>He doesn\u2019t hold grudges or have prejudices toward anyone \u2013 it may take him a minute to warm up to strangers (or it may not), but soon he\u2019ll be holding a gibberish conversation with the lady he just met in the store.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>He trusts us unconditionally.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Even though he does it unconsciously, he treats every new day like it may be his last, and if it\u2019s going to be, then he might as well make sure he lives to his fullest.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>In short, there\u2019s a lot he can teach me. Whether I realize it or not, every day I\u2019m trying to put limits on what he can or can\u2019t do. Don\u2019t throw your cup. Put your toys away. Don\u2019t hit the dog. Obviously, some things are for his well-being, but some of them seem kind of arbitrarily set. Instead of trying to teach him, should we be going to him for instruction? I kinda believe that when I look at him, in many ways I\u2019m seeing what humanity was meant to be in its purest form. Joy. Love. Curiosity. Bright blue eyes twinkling with laughter. I realize that as you grow up, life can surely beat you down, and you have new responsibilities and problems all the time, and sometimes you can get overwhelmed to the point of wanting to curl up and cry, but does it always have to be that way?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>I think, no matter how old, everyone has a spark of that original joy and mystery and excitement, which is maybe why I still feel like I could be a kid. In some people, I think it gets so suppressed that they don\u2019t realize it\u2019s still there, but it is. Life gets in the way most of the time, but maybe I should let C take the reins once in a while, and forget about the mess and how childish it may seem to my far superior, grown-up mind (sarcasm, in case you missed it), and just run and play and be silly with him. Now of course, I\u2019m not suggesting that you can just abandon everything and go be a hermit. With growing up comes some modicum of responsibility, whether we like it or not. But I am suggesting that we don\u2019t always have to take life so seriously that we don\u2019t enjoy it.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Did I answer my question? I\u2019m not sure.

Your children will grow up to be kinder and more considerate of others if you teach them how to be that way when they&#8217;re young. You can do that by setting a good example. You must always say &#8220;please&#8221; and &#8220;thank you&#8221; to your kids. Even when you are saying, &#8220;Please get your bicycle off my foot,&#8221; or &#8220;Thank you for the dead slug.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">And don&#8217;t forget good table manners. Everyone tends to be a little too relaxed at the dinner table when it comes to proper behavior. Maybe you think it&#8217;s funny when Daddy balances a spoon on the end of his nose or one of the kids makes a hat out of his napkin and wears it on his head all during dinner. If you don&#8217;t mind this kind of monkeying around, even when you&#8217;re dining out, ignore this advice. But, if you don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s appropriate to do this kind of stuff in public, then teach your kids what you think is acceptable and what isn&#8217;t acceptable, and then make sure that you&#8217;re consistent about the rules.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Kids have a hard enough time remembering household rules. They have an even harder time remembering rules for\u00a0<i>dinner at home</i>\u00a0and rules for\u00a0<i>dinner out,</i>\u00a0when those sets of rules aren&#8217;t the same. Some general table manners include no gross jokes, no throwing food, no leaning back while sitting in the chairs, no talking with food in your mouth (including no &#8220;see food&#8221; jokes) \u2014 and definitely no loud belching or passing wind.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Yes, in some cultures belching after a meal is acceptable and even encouraged. However, don&#8217;t let someone&#8217;s excuse about practicing multiculturalism sway you. If belching isn&#8217;t allowed in your family&#8217;s culture, don&#8217;t allow it at the table. And if you do happen to burp (and who doesn&#8217;t?), say, &#8220;Excuse me.&#8221; If you laugh about burping, you&#8217;ve created a family precedent, and your kids will belch and laugh about it the first time they have dinner at a friend&#8217;s house.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Good manners that you can teach your children include not interrupting people while they talk and not shoving their way in front of others to always be first, two things that kids are\u00a0<i>infamous</i>\u00a0for doing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Other manners you can teach your children include how to</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Write thank-you notes</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Make get-well cards for sick relatives</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Say\u00a0<i>please\u00a0</i>and\u00a0<i>thank you</i></span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Acknowledge when someone is talking</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Say\u00a0<i>good-bye</i>\u00a0to someone who is leaving</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Share cookies with a friend</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Always give their parents the green M&amp;Ms</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">A growing problem in schools is the lack of good manners from children. Children don&#8217;t treat teachers, staff, or classmates with respect. So schools now are teaching good manners and respect in addition to conflict management. And yet, good manners still begin at home and should be taught by parents.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Here are some guidelines that you can use at home:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><b>Be kind to others.\u00a0</b>Telling kids, &#8220;Do unto others as you would have them do unto you,&#8221; doesn&#8217;t really mean anything to them. Instead, stress the importance of treating others the same way they&#8217;d like to be treated, especially when you see them doing something that you know they themselves don&#8217;t like. For example, if your son hates to be interrupted and yet he interrupts people, then remind him, &#8220;Jonah, you really don&#8217;t like it when people interrupt you, so please don&#8217;t do that to Jeremiah.&#8221;</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><b>Understand their actions.\u00a0</b>Help your children understand the harm they can cause by doing or saying thoughtless and unkind things. Ask them, &#8220;How would you feel if someone pointed at you, and started to laugh?&#8221; In the beginning, you may simply be doing damage control, but eventually you&#8217;ll be helping them to avoid harmful words or actions.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><b>Show them the way.\u00a0</b>Children do whatever they have to do to express themselves. Sometimes that comes off looking and sounding pretty bad. Playing a role reversal game with your child can help show them how to handle situations. Let them ask the question or behave a certain way, and you respond by showing them how their behavior should appear.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><b>Be a good role model.\u00a0</b>&#8220;Do as I say, but not as I do&#8221; is a joke. Your kids probably want to respond with, &#8220;Yeah, like you&#8217;d catch\u00a0<i>me</i>\u00a0playing bridge with a bunch of 50-year-old women!&#8221; When you want your child to show good manners and respect, you must also practice good manners and respect. Say please and thank you, admit your mistakes, apologize, and treat people, in general, with kindness and respect. The reward of this behavior is that your children will grow up having many friends and a family that loves being around her.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><b>Share.\u00a0</b>Share with your children so they understand the importance of sharing with others. Compliment them when you see them sharing with others.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><b>Keep kids healthy.\u00a0</b>Children tend to behave badly when they&#8217;re tired or hungry. Kids need sleep and nutritious foods to survive. It&#8217;s that simple.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><b>Practice family politeness.\u00a0</b>Everyone in the family must practice &#8220;please&#8221; and &#8220;thank-you&#8221; policy in which, for example, no request is considered unless the person asking says &#8220;please.&#8221; When one of your children forgets, just give him or her a look that says, &#8220;I&#8217;m waiting.&#8221; They soon catch on. Use the same approach for saying &#8220;thank you.&#8221;</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><b>Thank-you notes.\u00a0</b>Teach your children the importance of thanking people for gifts.

Men and women have always used some form of face decoration to express different emotions and events: war, marriage, religious celebration and rites of passage. Today, wearing makeup is often seen as a rite of passage into womanhood for a young girl. This transition seems to be happening earlier and earlier, and girls are trying to approach womanhood at an earlier age than years past.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Many girls treasure trying on Mommy&#8217;s shoes, dresses and makeup. A quick trip to stores like Bath and Body Works, The Children&#8217;s Place and Target reveals an array of what 10 or 20 years ago would be for &#8220;play&#8221; at home but are now leaving Mommy&#8217;s room for new desirable locations like the beach, school or parties. There is &#8220;glitter&#8221; everything, brightly-colored nail polishes and lotions, lip gloss, eye makeup, bikinis and numerous other &#8220;older&#8221; girl items marketed toward girls ages 6 to 12. The targeted ages are becoming younger and younger, which leads parents wondering the right age for girls to take &#8220;dress-up&#8221; out of the house.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Corrie Wallace, a high school teacher in Evanston, Ill., is seeing girls dress in more revealing clothing and wear more makeup at younger and younger ages. In her five years of teaching, she says the change has been startling. Girls are getting away with more.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that on the average, girls physically mature by age 9, although their psychological maturity may not be reached by this age. This introduces an interesting dilemma for parents.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>According to T. Joel Wade, associate professor of psychology at Bucknell University, there is no &#8220;right&#8221; age to wear makeup. But be aware that it puts young girls in a different league. &#8220;The wearing of makeup does lead to increased interest from males,&#8221; he says. &#8220;It sends a message that says, &#8216;I am mature and possibly interested in being in a relationship or being looked at as a possible sexual partner.&#8217; The makeup changes the perceptions of the face so that the dimensions of the face are more similar to that of a mature woman. This then tends to elicit attention from mature males. Some young girls may not be ready for this attention and may be unable to deal with it in a healthy manner.&#8221;</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Should She or Shouldn&#8217;t She?</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Paula Maldonado, of Evanston Ill., and mother of three girls, agrees. &#8220;I&#8217;m an old-fashioned mom,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I don&#8217;t let my 12-year-old wear makeup. She does use Chapstick. If she has a party or a dance, she can wear color lipstick. I want my 12-year-old to look like a 12-year-old. It&#8217;s difficult for a kid to be a kid today.&#8221; Her daughter, Mari, has accepted her mother&#8217;s decision, although being the second girl certainly helps. Maldonado says her oldest daughter, Lani, &#8220;wanted to be all dolled up, she pushed the envelope, but Mari is pretty accepting of it.&#8221;</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>But other parents see different sides to this issue. Several parents view wearing makeup as a girl&#8217;s expression of her own personal sense of style, which really begins to change and take on a life of its own at this age. Other parents see wearing makeup as a way to increase their daughters&#8217; self-esteem. And yet other parents concede that the makeup issue is a bartering tool, allowing girls to wear makeup as long as they finish homework or stay out of trouble. And as Amanda Tarshis, 14, points out, a parent&#8217;s rule on the makeup issue might not be enforceable. &#8220;Girls will just go to their friends&#8217; [homes] and put it on,&#8221; she says. &#8220;Girls wear makeup to look older, to seem more mature.&#8221;</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Underneath the Makeup</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Dr. Robert Butterworth, clinical psychologist based in Los Angeles, says, &#8220;A lot of times, a girl will come home and say, &#8216;Everyone&#8217;s doing it,&#8217;&#8221; says Dr. Robert Butterworth, a clinical psychologist based in Los Angeles. &#8220;Show up at her school and see. Ask them why they want to wear makeup. If it&#8217;s because everyone else is doing it or so guys will notice them, those are dangerous signals. The girl[s] may not be getting what they need and are looking for it elsewhere. However, if the girl has scratches, scars or acne, it might be OK.&#8221;</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>As Maldonado points out, how you feel about makeup sets a precedent for everything else. She points out that allowing her daughters to &#8220;grow up&#8221; on this issue sooner than she feels is necessary may send the message that they can partake in other &#8220;adult&#8221; activities sooner than they are ready for them.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Society&#8217;s view of what a mature, attractive woman looks like undoubtedly involves makeup. While a girl dressing up in her mother&#8217;s clothes may be positive reinforcement of a strong role model, this ideal can be botched if girls are allowed to take it out of the house sooner than they are ready. Since parents have more money to spend on their kids these days, companies are honing in on girls&#8217; insecurities with targeted \u2013 and often effective \u2013 advertising. But parents ultimately have to decide how they want their girls to feel about themselves.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>&#8220;I do think one can say that wearing makeup is conforming to societal images of beauty,&#8221; Wade says. &#8220;The marketing of makeup to young girls does tend to send them the message that they need to wear makeup to be accepted and that wearing makeup at their age is appropriate and makes them more attractive.&#8221;</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n", "post_id": 2356, "location": false, "date": "02-02-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners animals aviation books breakfast cars children climate cooking dessert FAMILY food frog gaming Gillian Sims good manners allaboutmanners", "Chapstick"], "text": "<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.poetry4kids.com/images/illustrations/i-ran-for-the-chapstick.png\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong>I ran for the Chapstick mom keeps in her purse.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong>My lips were so chapped that they couldn&#8217;t feel worse!</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong>I dug through her handbag and pulled it out quickly,</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong>then sighed in relief as I smeared it on thickly.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong>I felt so much better I almost rejoiced.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong>My painful, dry lips were now mended and moist.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong>My dad burst out laughing.

Perhaps you need to decide between putting that special dinner on the table, buying<a title=\"Christmas gifts\" href=\"http://voices.yahoo.com/theme/1326/christmas_gifts.html\" rel=\"&amp;content_type=theme&amp;content_type_id=1326\">Christmas gifts</a>\u00a0and having some other form of costly tradition. You have probably been pretty stressed out, spent more hours with your head in your hands then you wish to confess to and now have finally realized that no matter how hard you try there is just nothing you can do to hide your financial situation from your kids any further.</p>\n<p>Allow me to assure you from experience, that most children can be very understanding and are most of the time very eager to help out. The key is to give them the facts in a very age appropriate manner and convert their mind immediately by giving suggestions on how they might be able to help make the situation better.</p>\n<p><b>Small children (Ages</b>\u00a0<b>3 to 9</b><b>)</b>\u00a0very seldom have any sort of concept of money. They have no idea yet how hard it can be for an Adult to earn the funds necessary to take care of everything needed to keep them safe. On the upside of that is that most kids during within this age group are not yet quiet as jaded and are still much easier pleased with small things. As much as they love the flashy new toys, they are just as easily pleased with the opportunity of unwrapping &#8220;many&#8221; packages.</p>\n<p>Think dollar Store and homemade presents for Christmas and enlist your kids in becoming Santa&#8217;s little helpers. If you have more then one little munchkin, take those that are old enough to help make gifts at a time and ask them to help you create some easy to make homemade gifts. Make sure to emphasize how much of a big help they are in making this holiday just a bit brighter. Safe money on wrapping paper by asking your kids to create some wonderful pieces of Christmas Art which you can use to wrap up presents for Grandparents, Aunts, Uncles and close Friends of the Family.</p>\n<p>Ask little ones to help you make &#8220;ornaments&#8221;, which you can give away as presents. You can also ask them to help you put the Elf\u00a0<a title=\"Christmas Dinner\" href=\"http://voices.yahoo.com/topic/48703/christmas_dinner.html\" rel=\"&amp;content_type=topic&amp;content_type_id=48703\">Christmas Dinner</a>\u00a0together. What would an Elf eat for Christmas? If you would like to keep it more traditionally Christian you can also explain that Marie and Joseph were very poor and didn&#8217;t have all that fancy food for the birth of Baby Jesus and that you don&#8217;t have to have Turkey, Ham etc to celebrate this Holiday.</p>\n<p><b>Children 10 to 15 Years old</b></p>\n<p>These kids are a lot smarter then most of us give them credit for. By this point, the belief in Santa Claus has long since stopped as well. You don&#8217;t want to destroy their Christmas, but if you sit them down you can explain to them why money is a bit tight right now. Let them know that you would like to give them everything they want, but you just can&#8217;t do it. You can ask them for their help in various ways.</p>\n<p>Give them a price range you are able to afford and ask them to pick one or two presents they would really enjoy within that price range.</p>\n<p>Ask them to help you make some presents for the younger children and those family members who are not living with you.</p>\n<p>Ask them to help you pick between various Christmas Traditions. Let them know which ones the choices are and then give each person one full weight vote. (A good lesson in having to make choices that are not comfortable at all) Encourage them to weight out the Pro and Cons for each choice they have.</p>\n<p>Tell them what you have available financially for Christmas Dinner and have your kids go shopping with you for it. You may just be surprised what you end up eating that Night. My kids did this with me one year and we ended up saving enough money on the Dinner (turned out to be extra cheesy Tuna Noodle Casserole and Apple Pie with Ice Cream for dessert) to be able to purchase a DVD we all wanted as a family Christmas Gift.</p>\n<p><b>The big kids (Ages 16 to 18)</b></p>\n<p>I am sorry to say, but at this point they have a right to know what is going on and even have the opportunity to help out financially. At this point they are so close to being Adults that they need to realize what happens when finances take a sudden nose dive.</p>\n<p>Let your kids honestly know that there may not be any money for Presents this year and that if they want something very badly, they may have to get a small job and purchase it them-selves.</p>\n<p>If they insist on a fancy Christmas Feast (for some reason this seems to be the age were they seem to be the most demanding and even most clueless ones) then you may give them to option to be the supplier of the feast. At this Age they are able to get small part time jobs, baby sitting jobs, dog walking jobs etc.</p>\n<p>I know it appears a bit harsh to most of you, but at this point they really need to learn that just because you want something it will be readily given to you. Perhaps when it is on their Shoulders to earn the money to supply what they believe to be so important they will get a whole new appreciation of the value of a Dollar.</p>\n<p>Not an easy lesson to teach a child at the last moment, but hopefully you have already installed an attitude of gratitude, being happy for what you can have and perhaps even that it is more important to be together with those you love then having a lot of fancy new things. Remember that nothing ever lasts forever and that when times are the darkest there is usually a small sliver of light somewhere around the corner. Keep your head up and use this opportunity in getting closer to your kids and teach them some important life lessons!</p>\n", "post_id": 236, "location": false, "date": "12-07-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["ripples", "feathered friends", "dedicated friend", "allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners animals aviation books breakfast cars children climate cooking dessert FAMILY food frog gaming Gillian S"], "text": "<h2 style=\"text-align:center;\"></h2>\n<div>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong><a href=\"http://poetreecreations.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/jan-1-5.jpg\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><img alt=\"Jan 1 (5)\" src=\"https://poetreecreations.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/jan-1-5.jpg?w=300&amp;h=225\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></span></a></strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>I walk to find</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>A peace of mind</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>By the water\u2019s edge,</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>River bursting from the rain</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Still it feels the same</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>White feathered friends</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Swim by my side</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Like a dedicated friend, one so kind</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Creating ripples, causing no harm</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Creating ripples of calm</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>A window of still life</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Walking by the waters side</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>A gust of wind now picks up my hair,</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>I\u2019m in a place where I really don\u2019t care</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>We should all take the time</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>To go somewhere tranquil</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>To find a peace of mind</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Gillian Sims</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Why not check out</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>More of\u00a0</strong></span><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Gillian Sims</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0Poetry at</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.poetreecreations.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.poetreecreations.org</a></strong></span></p>\n</div>\n", "post_id": 2361, "location": false, "date": "02-02-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners animals aviation books breakfast cars children climate cooking dessert FAMILY food frog ", "GROWING UP"], "text": "<h1></h1>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><a href=\"http://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/shave.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2365\" alt=\"SHAVE\" src=\"https://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/shave.jpg?w=206&#038;h=245\" width=\"206\" height=\"245\" /></a></strong></span></div>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Children are growing up too quickly because of modern life.

Even in our money-driven world, you don&#8217;t have to provide your child with extra, though <a href=\"http://www.sofeminine.co.uk/guide/psycho/f13248-managing-money.html\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">handling money</span></a> is good for children as it teaches them the value of money (whether it be regular pocket money, money they receive for their birthday, cash gifts from family members or money put into a savings account for them by grandparents). Customs vary from country to country: in northern Europe, Germany, Austria, Denmark and Luxembourg, children tend to receive pocket money from an early age, while further south, in Spain and Italy, <a href=\"http://www.sofeminine.co.uk/mother/children-sr29.html\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">kids</span></a> tend to receive money on special occasions rather than on a regular basis. In the UK, 86% of kids receive regular pocket money from their parents.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>At what age should I give my children pocket money? There&#8217;s no point in giving children money if they don&#8217;t understand what it means! Give a five-year-old a coin to go and buy some sweets every now and then, but nothing more. Don&#8217;t start giving your children pocket money before they can count and before they&#8217;re able to understand a bit about the <a href=\"http://www.sofeminine.co.uk/home-relationships.html\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">relationship</span></a> between money and what you can buy with it. If they can&#8217;t add or subtract yet, forget it. Start giving your children a small sum of money when they&#8217;re 7 or 8 years old, or otherwise wait until they ask for pocket money themselves!</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>How much should I give? It depends on how old your child is. According to a Halifax survey (carried out in 2006), the average weekly sum for pocket money is \u00a36.30 for 7-12-year-olds and \u00a39.76 for 12-16-year-olds. Take your budget into account, and explain to your child that their pocket money depends on how much you earn.

However, you could give your children a bit of extra money for special jobs such as painting. Tips &#8211; Don&#8217;t stop your children from buying something silly or useless with their pocket money. Let them make their own mistakes and learn from them (unless what they want to buy is dangerous, that is!). &#8211; Increase the amount every year. &#8211; Make it clear what you buy your children (clothes, school materials, books, etc) and what they buy with their pocket money (extra games for the Playstation, new roller blades, sweets, toys and gadgets). &#8211; When you go shopping, make your children read the price tags, compare prices with them, explain the cost of living to them and show them how to spend their money wisely.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>What if my child doesn&#8217;t want pocket money?! It&#8217;s rare for children to refuse pocket money, but they may do if they aren&#8217;t mature enough and are worried it&#8217;s too grown up for them. Don&#8217;t force them into taking it! If your child is too young, there&#8217;s no hurry. Wait until they ask you to buy them sweets or a toy and explain that with pocket money they can buy things for themselves. Explain that pocket money is for big boys and girls. A small amount will be enough for them to handle.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>HOW MUCH DO YOU GIVE YOUR KIDS?</strong></span></p>\n", "post_id": 2385, "location": false, "date": "02-09-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["breakfast cars children climate cooking dessert FAMILY food frog gaming Gillian Sims good manners health home kid allaboutmanners animals aviation books breakfast cars children climate cooking dessert"], "text": "<h1><span style=\"color:#ffffff;font-family:Arial;font-size:medium;\"><a href=\"http://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/moneyyyyyyyyy.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft  wp-image-2393\" style=\"width:220px;height:202px;\" alt=\"moneyyyyyyyyy\" src=\"https://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/moneyyyyyyyyy.jpg?w=160&#038;h=105\" width=\"160\" height=\"105\" /></a></span></h1>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ffffff;font-family:Arial;font-size:medium;\"><strong>If I wash all the pots how m</strong><strong>uch will you give me?

They wait around in your body fat until your body needs them.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Fat-soluble vitamins are happy to stay stored in your body for awhile \u2014 some stay for a few days, some for up to 6 months! Then, when it&#8217;s time for them to be used, special carriers in your body take them to where they&#8217;re needed. Vitamins A, D, E, and K are all fat-soluble vitamins.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Water-soluble vitamins are different. When you eat foods that have water-soluble vitamins, the vitamins don&#8217;t get stored as much in your body. Instead, they travel through your bloodstream.

The gift-getting, treats and parties is full-on. Many kids experience a different set of social circumstances at Christmas than they have throughout the year. They may meet relatives they rarely see; go to unfamiliar places; and often make multiple visits in a day. Kids from separated families often get a double dose of gifts, dinners and relatives.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>But Christmas is a time when kids\u2019 manners are sorely tested. Parents and guardians need to be mindful of Christmas etiquette as our kids enjoy the festive season.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Christmas etiquette revolves around four area:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>1. Party manners:\u00a0Parties require kids to share, to hold a conversation or play well with others and to fit in with what the host wants. Help kids understand what\u2019s expected when they go out. Simple social graces such as refraining from gulping food down is a good place to start.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>2. Receiving gifts:\u00a0This is a biggie! What to say when you open a gift and you find it\u2019s not to your liking! Hold your tongue, find out who gave it to you and say thank you&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..with eye contact. Lots of presents means lots of thank you&#8230;..and kisses and hugs.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>3. Family gatherings:\u00a0Having to put up with the kisses and hugs from that weird aunt can be enough to turn most kids off! But good mannered kids take their cues from others and will put up with well-intentioned relatives. Using names and making eye contact when kids speak are good social skills as well. Using a knife and fork when they eat their Christmas meal is also a basic social skill that some kids lack.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>4. Celebrating with friends:\u00a0Our multi-cultural society means that not everyone celebrates Christmas. Perhaps they can help these friends to feel included at this time of year by giving them a holiday card or gift so they don\u2019t feel left out.\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Teaching etiquette and social graces to children and young people is done in four ways:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>1. Modelling:\u00a0Kids need to see you being polite &amp; considerate of different social situations.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>2. Reminding:\u00a0Some need a reminder of how to behave before going out.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>3. Practicing:\u00a0You need to practise or role play good manner and social skills such as greeting others.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>4. Cueing:\u00a0Some kids need to be quietly cued about doing the right thing when they forget. No fuss or embarrassment. Just a reminder how they should behave.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Help your kids reflect well on you in social situations this Christmas.</strong></span></p>\n", "post_id": 244, "location": false, "date": "12-22-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners animals aviation books breakfast cars children climate cooking dessert FAMILY food frog allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners ", "FAMILY"], "text": "<h1><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><a href=\"http://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/kiddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-2459\" style=\"width:334px;height:117px;\" alt=\"kiddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd\" src=\"https://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/kiddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd.jpg?w=160&#038;h=107\" width=\"160\" height=\"107\" /></a></strong></span></h1>\n<div>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>School holiday&#8217;s is\u00a0where we try to have fun together as a family, often for free or without spending much money.

Drinking water helps to curb cravings, helps your body function better, gives you more energy, prevents/reduced headaches and other dehydration symptoms, improves your skin, flushes out toxins, and so much more. And if you drink it ice cold, it burns a few extra calories heating your body back up. <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-wink' title=';)'>;)</span>\n\n\n<p>If you don\u2019t like the taste of plain water, try:</p>\n\n<p>* Drink unsweetened hot tea (I love fruity and minty teas because they are sweet enough without sugar; I have a major sweet tooth).

Especially when money is tight and the weather is unpredictable. But fear not, whilst it may seem that the holidays will never end and the children may be getting restless, we have some great ideas to keep them occupied, even on the gloomiest days.</strong></span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Have a painting day</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>A really good, cost effective way of getting paper for children to paint on, is to use lining paper \u2013 the paper sold by DIY shops for lining your walls before painting. It comes in long rolls and you can cut a length and either attach it to a door (might be worth putting a couple of old towels down to protect the floor!) or you can take it outdoors lay it on the ground and let the children run riot with the paint. Encourage them to try painting on a big scale and to try new techniques, not just using a paint brush, encourage them to use their hands and their feet as a brush.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>To make it an even cheaper event, you could try making your own paint as well.</strong></span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>How to make paint</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Ingredients</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>750 mls water</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>65 grams cornflour (cornstarch)</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>food colouring</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Directions</strong></span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Mix 250mls water with the cornflour.

Children will have fun wherever they are and will have just as much fun camping in their own back garden as they would at an expensive campsite.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>You can even build a camp fire (adult supervision at all times!) and have a great evening sitting round the fire singing songs, telling stories and even eating smoors. For those Brits that have never heard of S\u2019mores, they are a traditional campfire treat popular in the United States and Canada. They consist of a roasted marshmallow and a layer of chocolate, sandwiched between two pieces of graham cracker. We don\u2019t have graham crackers in the UK, but apparently the nearest thing we have is a digestive biscuit.</strong></span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Go to the Beach</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><img title=\"child on beach\" alt=\"child on beach\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.makeitandmendit.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/child-on-beach-150x150.jpg\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>The weather in summer may be pretty hit and miss in the UK, but that shouldn\u2019t stop you having a day out at the beach. If you set off expecting it to be wet, it can only get better. Just accept it\u2019s going to be wet, and grab some waterproofs and a picnic and head on down to your nearest beach for some fun and games.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>You can even have a wet weather picnic if you go prepared. You could always take a pop up tent to shelter in if the weather is really bad, but most days the weather holds out long enough to have some games on the beach.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>You don\u2019t need the sweltering sun to build sand castles, go rock pooling, or make beach art with driftwood and seaweed. Children will have fun whatever the weather.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>When preparing a wet weather picnic, think about taking some warm food. Sausages and baked beans can be kept warm in wide mouth flasks and homemade soup with chunky bread always goes down well.

It is important to help the children with this stage as you need to ensure that the seeds stay in the top of the head, otherwise you\u2019ll have hair sprouting from under the eyes.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Use the small elastic band to pinch off a nose about half way up the head.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Use the second elastic band to tie off the bottom, or you could just tie a firm knot in the stocking.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>The children can decorate by pasting on eyes, mouth, ears, or what ever else inspires them.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>When you\u2019ve completed your Fuzzy Head, you can either rest it on a saucer or put it in a small plastic pot, such as a left over hummus pot with water in the bottom.

Go for a miniature food theme, the children will love it. Try miniature fairy cakes, mini sausages, mini pizzas, mini tomatoes, mini sandwiches and even mini fairy bread. An Australian friend introduced me to the delights of fairy bread and my children loved her for it. Butter some slices of white bread and sprinkle liberally with hundreds and thousands then using cookie cutters, cut the bread into shapes. Not a particularly healthy choice, but fun as a real holiday treat.</strong></span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Make a den</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Dens are great fun whatever your age. There\u2019s something magical about sitting with your friends in your secret den. The great thing about making a den is that it isn\u2019t dependent on the weather.

They aren\u2019t high on my list of needed items but Hubs (Short for husband, I \n\n<em>desperately</em>\n\n wanted to call him Right Brain but \n\n<a href=\"http://www.jeannerobertson.com/\">Jeanne Robertson</a>\n\n already did that) is determined they need to be done.  Of course, First Kid does have some not quite straight teeth but it is just a matter of whether that bothers a person or not.  It doesn\u2019t bother First Kid so it doesn\u2019t bother me.  Hubs of course looks farther ahead and figures she\u2019ll care later on in life.  Not a big deal, right?

This has always been true for children: all parents can remember their own tears or rage at the cruelty of another child; all parents can remember wanting desperately to be accepted and approved of by other kids. Most of us can remember, at some point in our lives, longing for a best friend.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://webel.net/\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Photo: Lance Webel\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.ahaparenting.com/img/www.flickr.comphotoslancewebel148411128inset-72057594129487897group2.jpg\" /></a></p>\n<p>Things are even more complicated for children now, as media has introduced children to the world of adult mores before they are emotionally ready. Our children do not know, just instinctively, how to build good relationships with other children in such a culture of shifting rules.</p>\n<p>Luckily, healthy kids generally make healthy choices even in the context of difficult peer situations. That means that if children have good relationships at home they have a healthy head start, but they still need your help in learning to navigate a complex social world. Some ideas on how to help your kids develop the social skills they need:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Foster good social skills from toddlerhood on.</strong>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This is one of the most important skill sets your child will ever\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 develop. It is infinitely more important to her future happiness than\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 helping her develop her intellect.</li>\n</ol>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Support his friendships.</strong>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Honor and reinforce your child&#8217;s developing friendships. Talk about\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 them, remember them, create opportunities to play. Remember that\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 children get aggravated with each other, just as adults do. It doesn&#8217;t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 mean the end of a friendship, necessarily, just that they need help to\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 work through the issues that come up.</li>\n</ol>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Model respectful relating.</strong>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Remember that your child will treat others as you treat her. In\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 addition to the obvious everyday respect, that means that you give her\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 criticism in private, not in front of others, including her friends.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Which means you have to find tactful ways to talk to your young child\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and other kids about the way they are treating each other, to help them\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 work out difficulties when they play together.</li>\n</ol>\n</ol>\n<p><img alt=\"Photo: Phil Cantor\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.ahaparenting.com/img/pc08whisper.jpg\" /></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Teach your child that people are important.</strong>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All parents have to choose their battles, so put up with messiness and\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 dawdling if you must, but teach your child consideration for others.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Model it for him early on, praise it, help him brainstorm to solve peer\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 problems, and don&#8217;t let your child intentionally or unintentionally\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 disrespect another person. It you can&#8217;t confront it as it happens\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 without embarrassing your child, be sure to talk about it later. As\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 kids get older, you may need to be very explicit about insisting that\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 they acknowledge adults in their presence, as well as other kids.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Often preteens and young adolescents need to be reminded of this, and\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 to be given coaching on how to handle interactions that feel awkward to\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 them.</li>\n<li><strong>Help your kids how to repair rifts in relationships.\u00a0</strong>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When we think about repairing relationships, we usually focus on apologizing.\u00a0 But premature apologies won\u2019t be heartfelt and may\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 backfire by causing the child to hold a grudge. Giving them a chance\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 to cool down first always works better.Apologizing is a very useful friendship skill that doesn\u2019t come easily\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 to people in our culture. Children learn how to apologize by watching\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 their parents. If you never apologize, they won\u2019t either. If you\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 apologize graciously and often, to them and to others, they will too.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The secret of helping kids learn to apologize is not making the apology\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 into a punishment.</li>\n<li><strong>Understand and teach the emotional intelligence skills necessary in all relationships.</strong>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Examples include listening and &#8220;I&#8221; statements, which will pave the way in all your&#8217;s child&#8217;s relationships.</li>\n</ol>\n", "post_id": 2500, "location": false, "date": "02-21-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["anners allaboutmanners animals aviation books breakfast cars children climate cooking dessert FAMILY food frog allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutm", "funny puns"], "text": "<h1><a href=\"http://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/clever.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-2503\" style=\"width:250px;height:171px;\" alt=\"CLEVER\" src=\"https://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/clever.jpg?w=160&#038;h=149\" width=\"160\" height=\"149\" /></a></h1>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>I read a lot of puns, recently.

This is because your child has suddenly developed a voice and a sense of independence but not an understanding of how life works i.e. That you can\u2019t always get what you want.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Fortunately, there&#8217;s a great deal of useful advice available to help with toddler behaviour, and here&#8217;s some of the most effective&#8230;</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Reward good behaviour \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Perhaps the best way to discourage bad behaviour is to reward good behaviour. We\u2019e not talking about giving her treat every time she behaves herself but should give her lots of praise, love and attention. So when she does misbehave, and she suddenly doesn\u2019t get these things, she&#8217;s less likely to go it again.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Making her do what\u2019s she\u2019s told \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It\u2019s important to realise that you can\u2019t actually make your toddler do what she\u2019s told. Ultimately, she will only do something if she wants to. So the key is to try to make her want to. This may sound like an impossible task but remember you&#8217;re much smarter than your child. For example, if she refuses to clear her toys away say to her, &#8220;I bet you can&#8217;t put all your toys away in the time it takes me to count to ten.&#8221;</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Misbehaviour in public \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We all dread those occasions when our delightful toddler decides to misbehave in public. It can feel like everyone within a five mile radius is looking at you and often they are. The secret here is to react in the same way as you do when she misbehaves at home, which should be in a calm but authoritative manner. Your toddler will notice if you handle her differently (and differently in this instance usually means softer), and she&#8217;ll be more likely to repeat her performance the next time you go out.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Tantrums \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 They\u2019re not called the terrible twos for nothing. Temper tantrums may be a real pain for parents but they\u2019re all just part of growing up. Your toddler is beginning to learn how to express herself physically and emotionally so occasionally, when she doesn\u2019t get what she wants, she&#8217;ll bring out the fireworks.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>The best way to deal with tantrums is to stay calm, let them pass and never, ever give in. The goal is to make you child see that throwing a hissy fit isn\u2019t going to get her what she wants. As long as she\u2019s not hurting herself, just ignore her. She\u2019ll soon realise the pointlessness of shouting and screaming.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;text-decoration:underline;\"><strong>Tells us how you cope with kids Tantrums -\u00a0make a comment?</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n", "post_id": 2505, "location": false, "date": "02-22-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners animals aviation books breakfast cars children climate cooking dessert FAMILY food frog gaming Gillian Sims good manners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners", "the \u2018Golden Rules"], "text": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/gold.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2509\" alt=\"gold\" src=\"https://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/gold.jpg?w=160&#038;h=129\" width=\"160\" height=\"129\" /></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;font-family:Comic Sans MS;font-size:large;\">This can be displayed in the\u00a0 classroom at the start of a new school year and chanted frequently.

Make the conversation a little easier on both yourself and your children by preparing significantly before you sit down to talk. If you can anticipate tough questions, deal with your own anxieties ahead of time, and plan carefully what you\u2019ll be telling them, you will be better equipped to help your children handle the news.</strong></span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>What to say and how to say it</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Difficult as it may be to do, try to strike an empathetic tone and address the most important points right up front. Give your children the benefit of an honest\u2014but kid-friendly\u2014explanation.</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Tell the truth. Your kids are entitled to know why you are getting a divorce, but long-winded reasons may only confuse them. Pick something simple and honest, like \u201cWe can\u2019t get along anymore.\u201d You may need to remind your children that while sometimes parents and kids don&#8217;t always get along, parents and kids don&#8217;t stop loving each other or get divorced from each other.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Say \u201cI love you.\u201d However simple it may sound, letting your children know that your love for them hasn\u2019t changed is a powerful message.

Preempt your kids\u2019 questions about changes in their lives by acknowledging that some things will be different now, and other things won\u2019t. Let them know that together you can deal with each detail as you go.</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Avoid blaming</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>It\u2019s vital to be honest with your kids, but without being critical of your spouse. This can be especially difficult when there have been hurtful events, such as infidelity, but with a little diplomacy, you can avoid playing the blame game.</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Present a united front. As much as you can, try to agree in advance on an explanation for your separation or divorce\u2014and stick to it.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Plan your conversations. Make plans to talk with your children before any changes in the living arrangements occur. And plan to talk when your spouse is present, if possible.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Show restraint. Be respectful of your spouse when giving the reasons for the separation.\u00a0\u00a0</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>How much information to give</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Especially at the beginning of your separation or divorce, you\u2019ll need to pick and choose how much to tell your children. Think carefully about how certain information will affect them.</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Be age-aware. In general, younger children need less detail and will do better with a simple explanation, while older kids may need more information.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Share logistical information. Do tell kids about changes in their living arrangements, school, or activities, but don\u2019t overwhelm them with the details.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Keep it real.

Your next job is reassurance\u2014assuaging fears, straightening misunderstandings, and showing your unconditional love. The bottom line: kids need to know that your divorce isn\u2019t their fault.</strong></span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Help kids express feelings</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>For kids, divorce can feel like loss: the loss of a parent, the loss of the life they know. You can help your children grieve and adjust to new circumstances by supporting their feelings.</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Listen. Encourage your child to share their feelings and really <em>listen </em>to them. They may be feeling sadness, loss or frustration about things you may not have expected.\u00a0</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Help them find words for their feelings. It\u2019s normal for children to have difficulty expressing their feelings. You can help them by noticing their moods and encouraging them to talk.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Let them be honest. Children might be reluctant to share their true feelings for fear of hurting you. Let them know that whatever they say is okay. If they aren\u2019t able to share their honest feelings, they will have a harder time working through them.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Acknowledge their feelings. You may not be able to fix their problems or change their sadness to happiness, but it is important for you to acknowledge their feelings rather than dismissing them. You can also inspire trust by showing that you understand.</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Clearing up misunderstandings</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Many kids believe that they had something to do with the divorce, recalling times they argued with their parents, received poor grades, or got in trouble. You can help your kids let go of this misconception.</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Set the record straight. Repeat why you decided to get a divorce. Sometimes hearing the real reason for your decision can help.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Be patient. Kids may seem to \u201cget it\u201d one day and be unsure the next. Treat your child\u2019s confusion or misunderstandings with patience.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Reassure. As often as you need to, remind your children that both parents will continue to love them and that they are not responsible for the divorce.</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Give reassurance and love</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Children have a remarkable ability to heal when given the support and love they need. Your words, actions, and ability to remain consistent are all important tools to reassure your children of your unchanging love.</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Both parents will be there. Let your kids know that even though the physical circumstances of the family unit will change, they can continue to have healthy, loving relationships with both of their parents.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>It\u2019ll be okay. Tell kids that things won\u2019t always be easy, but that they will work out. Knowing it\u2019ll be all right can provide incentive for your kids to give a new situation a chance.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Closeness. Physical closeness\u2014in the form of hugs, pats on the shoulder, or simple proximity\u2014has a powerful way of reassuring your child of your love.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Be honest. When kids raise concerns or anxieties, respond truthfully. If you don\u2019t know the answer, say gently that you aren\u2019t sure right now, but you\u2019ll find out and it will be okay.</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Helping children cope with divorce: Provide stability and structure</strong></span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>While it\u2019s good for kids to learn to be flexible, adjusting to many new things at once can be very difficult. Help your kids adjust to change by providing as much stability and structure as possible in their daily lives.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Remember that establishing structure and continuity doesn\u2019t mean that you need rigid schedules or that mom and dad\u2019s routines need to be exactly the same. But creating some regular routines at each household and consistently communicating to your children what to expect will provide your kids with a sense of calm and stability.</strong></span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>The comfort of routines</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>The benefit of schedules and organization for younger children is widely recognized, but many people don\u2019t realize that older children appreciate routine, as well. Kids feel safer and more secure when they know what to expect next. Knowing that, even when they switch homes, dinnertime is followed by a bath and then homework, for example, can set a child\u2019s mind at ease.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Maintaining routine also means continuing to observe rules, rewards, and discipline with your children. Resist the temptation to spoil kids during a divorce by not enforcing limits or allowing them to break rules.</strong></span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Helping children cope with divorce: Take care of yourself</strong></span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>The first safety instruction for an airplane emergency is to put the oxygen mask on yourself before you put it on your child. The take-home message: take care of yourself so that you can be there for your kids.</strong></span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Your own recovery</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>If you are able to be calm and emotionally present, your kids will feel more at ease. The following are steps you can take toward improving your own well-being and outlook:</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Exercise often and eat a healthy diet. Exercise relieves the pent-up stress and frustration that are commonplace with divorce. And although cooking for one can be difficult, eating healthfully will make you feel better, inside and out\u2014so skip the fast food.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>See friends often. It may be tempting to hole up and not see friends and family who will inevitably ask about the divorce\u2014but the reality is that you need the distraction. Ask friends to avoid the topic; they\u2019ll understand.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Keep a journal. Writing down your feelings, thoughts, and moods can help you release tension, sadness, and anger. As time passes, you can look back on just how far you\u2019ve come.</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>You\u2019ll need support</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>At the very least, divorce is complicated and stressful\u2014and can be devastating without support.</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Lean on friends. Talk to friends or a support group about your bitterness, anger, frustration\u2014whatever the feeling may be\u2014so you don\u2019t take it out on your kids.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Never vent negative feelings to your child. Whatever you do, do not use your child to talk it out like you would with a friend.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Keep laughing. Try to inject humor and play into your life and the lives of your children as much as you can; it can relieve stress and give you all a break from sadness and anger.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>See a therapist. If you are feeling intense anger, fear, grief, shame, or guilt, find a professional to help you work through those feelings.</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Helping children cope with divorce: Work with your ex</strong></span></h2>\n<div>\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Struggling to make joint custody work?</strong></span></h3>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Conflict between parents\u2014separated or not\u2014can be very damaging for kids. It\u2019s crucial to avoid putting your children in the middle of your fights, or making them feel like they have to choose between you.</strong></span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0Rules of thumb</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Remember that your goal is to avoid lasting stress and pain for your children. The following tips can save them a lot of heartache.</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Take it somewhere else. Never argue in front of your children, whether it\u2019s in person or over the phone. Ask your ex to talk another time, or drop the conversation altogether.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Use tact. Refrain from talking with your children about details of their other parent\u2019s behavior. It\u2019s the oldest rule in the book: if you don\u2019t have anything nice to say, don\u2019t say anything at all.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Be nice. Be polite in your interactions with your ex-spouse. This not only sets a good example for your kids but can also cause your ex to be gracious in response.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Look on the bright side. Choose to focus on the strengths of all family members. Encourage children to do the same.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Work on it. Make it a priority to develop an amicable relationship with your ex-spouse as soon as possible. Watching you be friendly can reassure children and teach problem-solving skills as well.\u00a0</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>The big picture</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>If you find yourself, time after time, locked in battle with your ex over the details of parenting, try to step back and remember the bigger purpose at hand.</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Relationship with both parents. What\u2019s best for your kids in the long run? Having a good relationship with <em>both</em> of their parents throughout their lives.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>The long view. If you can keep long-term goals\u2014your children\u2019s physical and mental health, your independence\u2014in mind, you may be able to avoid disagreements about daily details. Think ahead in order to stay calm.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Everyone\u2019s well-being. The happiness of your children, yourself, and, yes, even your ex, should be the broad brushstrokes in the big picture of your new lives after divorce.</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2></h2>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Some children go through divorce with relatively few problems, while others have a very difficult time. It\u2019s normal for kids to feel a range of difficult emotions, but time, love, and reassurance should help them to heal. If your kids remain overwhelmed, though, you may need to seek professional help.</strong></span></p>\n<div>\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Normal reactions to separation and divorce</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Although strong feelings can be tough on kids, the following reactions can be considered normal for children.</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Anger. Your kids may express their anger, rage, and resentment with you and your spouse for destroying their sense of normalcy.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Anxiety. It\u2019s natural for children to feel anxious when faced with big changes in their lives.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Mild depression. Sadness about the family\u2019s new situation is normal, and sadness coupled with a sense of hopelessness and helplessness is likely to become a mild form of depression.</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>It will take some time for your kids to work through their issues about the separation or divorce, but you should see gradual improvement over time</strong><em><strong>.</strong> </em></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">YOUR COMMENTS WELCOME</span></p>\n</div>\n", "post_id": 2559, "location": false, "date": "02-25-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["baby pants", "allaboutmanners allaboutmanners animals aviation books breakfast cars children climate cooking dessert FAMILY food frog allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners "], "text": "<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img class=\"wp-image-2568\" alt=\"pants\" src=\"https://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/pants.jpg?w=160&#038;h=160\" width=\"160\" height=\"160\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>From baby to toddler in the blink of an eye,</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong> The last stage is hard I&#8217;m not gonna lie </strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>The nappies need to go, say &#8220;hello pants&#8221;</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong> Might be too soon but I&#8217;ll take the chance.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0A short time naked whilst watching cartoons,</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong> I&#8217;ve shown you the potty at the side of the room </strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>I keep on asking &#8220;do you need a wee?&#8221;</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong> A minute later the floor&#8217;s covered in pee.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><a name=\"yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1393497340780_3557\"></a> We try again every day,</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong> But all you want to do is play</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong> I encourage you as much as I can,</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong> Pants with cars, and praise, &#8220;come on lil man&#8221;.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0So much pride I felt the first time I saw</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong> You did a wee but this time not on the floor,</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong> Such a big boy doing more and more</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong> It won&#8217;t be long now, of that I&#8217;m sure.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0Months later you want the toilet instead</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong> Still a few accidents as I&#8217;d expect,</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong> But then comes the day you manage to stay dry</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong> Even on a trip out with distractions close by.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>The best day so far, I pray for many more</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong> Days with no nappies and no wee on the floor,</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong> Now you&#8217;re a big boy, my baby has gone</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong> I couldn&#8217;t be more proud of how well you have done</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Abbe Cutforth</strong></span></p>\n", "post_id": 2567, "location": false, "date": "02-27-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["etiquette", "grilled salmon", "Coral Gables", "society", "Chenery Park", "family night"], "text": "<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>IT\u2019S dinnertime, and 6-year-old Joaquin Hurtado is staying in his seat.

Think upscale dining with training wheels.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Chenery Park has many allies in the fight to teach manners to a new generation of children. Around the country, there are classes taught by self-appointed etiquette counselors \u2014 Emily Posts for a new age \u2014 delivering a more decentralized and less formal approach to teaching manners than in years past. A few restaurants, like Chenery Park, and high-end hotels set aside space and time for families.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>These etiquette experts say that new approaches are needed because parents no longer have the stomach, time or know-how to play bad cop and teach manners. Dinnertime has become a free-for-all in many households, with packed family schedules, the television on in the background and a modern-day belief of many parents that they should simply let children be children.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Some of these manners-minders acknowledge that they can sound like curmudgeons, just another generation of older folks mourning the lost habits of more refined times.

The level of grief depends on factors such as your age and personality, the age of your pet, and the circumstances of their death. Generally, the more significant the loss, the more intense the grief you\u2019ll feel.</strong></span></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Grief can be\u00a0 complicated by the role the animal played in your life. For example, if your\u00a0 pet was a working dog or a helper animal such as a guide dog, then you\u2019ll not\u00a0 only be grieving the loss of a companion but also the loss of a coworker or the\u00a0 loss of your independence. If\u00a0 you cared for your pet through a protracted illness, you likely grew to love\u00a0 him even more. If you lived alone and the pet was your only companion,\u00a0 coming to terms with his loss can be even harder. If you were unable to afford\u00a0 expensive veterinary treatment to prolong the life of your pet, you may even\u00a0 feel a profound sense of guilt.</strong></span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Everyone grieves differently</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Grieving is a personal and highly individual experience.\u00a0 Some people find grief comes in stages, where they experience different\u00a0 feelings such as denial, anger, guilt, depression, and eventually acceptance\u00a0 and resolution. Others find that grief is more cyclical, coming in waves, or a\u00a0 series of highs and lows. The lows are likely to be deeper and longer at the\u00a0 beginning and then gradually become shorter and less intense as time goes by. Still,\u00a0 even years after a loss, a sight, a sound, or a special anniversary can spark\u00a0 memories that trigger a strong sense of grief.</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>The grieving process happens only gradually. It can\u2019t be forced or hurried\u2014and there is no \u201cnormal\u201d timetable for grieving.\u00a0 Some people start to feel better in weeks or months. For others, the grieving\u00a0 process is measured in years. Whatever your grief experience, it\u2019s important to\u00a0 be patient with yourself and allow the process to naturally unfold.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Feeling sad, frightened, or lonely is a\u00a0 normal reaction to the loss of a beloved pet. Exhibiting these feelings\u00a0 doesn\u2019t mean you are weak, so you shouldn\u2019t feel ashamed.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Trying to ignore your pain or keep it from\u00a0 surfacing will only make it worse in the long run. For real healing, it is\u00a0 necessary to face your grief and actively deal with it. By expressing your\u00a0 grief, you\u2019ll likely need less time to heal than if you withhold or \u201cbottle up\u201d\u00a0 your feelings. Write about your feelings and talk with others about them.</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Dealing with the loss of a pet when others\u00a0 devalue your loss</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>One aspect that can make grieving for the loss of a\u00a0 pet so difficult is that pet loss is not appreciated by everyone. Friends and\u00a0 family may ask \u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal? It\u2019s just a pet!\u201d Some people assume that\u00a0 pet loss shouldn\u2019t hurt as much as human loss, or that it is somehow\u00a0 inappropriate to grieve for an animal. They may not understand because they\u00a0 don\u2019t have a pet of their own, or because they are unable to appreciate the\u00a0 companionship and love that a pet can provide.</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Don\u2019t\u00a0 argue with others about whether your grief is appropriate or not.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Accept\u00a0 the fact that the best support for your grief may come from outside your usual\u00a0 circle of friends and family members.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Seek\u00a0 out others who have lost pets; those who can appreciate the magnitude of your\u00a0 loss, and may be able to suggest ways of getting through the grieving process.</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Tips for coping with the grief of pet loss</strong></span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Sorrow and grief are normal and natural responses to death.\u00a0 Like grief for humans, grief for animal companions can only be dealt with over\u00a0 time, but there are healthy ways to cope with the pain. Here are some suggestions:</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Don\u2019t let anyone tell you how to feel, and don\u2019t tell yourself how to feel either. Your grief is your own, and no one\u00a0 else can tell you when it\u2019s time to \u201cmove on\u201d or \u201cget over it.\u201d Let yourself\u00a0 feel whatever you feel without embarrassment or judgment. It\u2019s okay to be\u00a0 angry, to cry or not to cry. It\u2019s also okay to laugh, to find moments of joy,\u00a0 and to let go when you\u2019re ready.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Reach out to others who have lost pets. Check out online message boards, pet loss hotlines, and pet loss support\u00a0 groups. If your own friends, family members, therapist, or clergy do not work\u00a0 well with the grief of pet loss, find someone who does.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Rituals can help healing. A funeral can\u00a0 help you and your family members openly express your feelings. Ignore people\u00a0 who think it\u2019s inappropriate to hold a funeral for a pet, and do what feels\u00a0 right for you.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Create a legacy. Preparing a memorial, planting\u00a0 a tree in memory of your pet, compiling a photo album or scrapbook, or otherwise\u00a0 sharing the memories you enjoyed with your pet, can create a legacy to\u00a0 celebrate the life of your animal companion.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Look after yourself. The stress of losing\u00a0 a pet can quickly deplete your energy and emotional reserves. Looking after\u00a0 your physical and emotional needs will help you get through this difficult\u00a0 time. Eat a healthy diet, get plenty of sleep, and exercise regularly to release\u00a0 endorphins and help boost your mood.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>If you have other pets, try to maintain\u00a0 your normal routine. Surviving pets can also experience loss when a pet\u00a0 dies, or they may become distressed by your sorrow. Maintaining their daily\u00a0 routines, or even increasing exercise and play times, will not only benefit the\u00a0 surviving pets but may also help to elevate your outlook too.</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Tips for seniors to cope with pet loss</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>As we age, we experience an increasing number of major life\u00a0 changes, including the loss of beloved friends, family members, and pets. The\u00a0 death of a pet can hit retired seniors even harder than younger adults who may\u00a0 be able to draw on the comfort of a close family, or distract themselves with\u00a0 the routine of work. For older adults who live alone, the pet was probably your\u00a0 sole companion, and taking care of the animal provided you with a sense of\u00a0 purpose and self-worth.</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><a href=\"http://helpguide.org/life/healthy_aging_seniors_aging_well.htm\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Try to find new meaning and joy in life.</span></a> Caring for a pet previously occupied your time and boosted your morale and\u00a0 optimism. Try to fill that time by volunteering, picking up a long-neglected\u00a0 hobby, taking a class, helping friends care for their pets, or even by getting\u00a0 another pet when the time feels right.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Stay connected with friends. Pets, dogs\u00a0 especially, can help seniors meet new people or regularly connect with friends\u00a0 and neighbors while out on a walk or in the dog park, for example. Having lost\u00a0 your pet, it\u2019s important that you don\u2019t now spend day after day alone. Try to spend time with at least one person every day. Regular face-to-face contact can help you ward off depression and stay\u00a0 positive. Call up an old friend or neighbor for a lunch date or join a club.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><a href=\"http://helpguide.org/life/senior_fitness_sports.htm\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Boost your vitality with exercise.</span></a> Pets\u00a0 help many older adults stay active and playful, which can boost your immune\u00a0 system and increase your energy. It\u2019s important to keep up your activity levels\u00a0 after the loss of your pet. Check with your doctor before starting an exercise\u00a0 program and then find an activity that you enjoy. Exercising in a group\u2014by\u00a0 playing a sport such as tennis or golf, or taking an exercise or swimming class\u2014can\u00a0 also help you connect with others.</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Helping a child cope with pet loss</strong></span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>The loss of a pet may be your child\u2019s first experience of\u00a0 death\u2014and your first opportunity to teach them about coping with the grief and\u00a0 pain that inevitably accompanies the joy of loving another living creature. Losing\u00a0 a pet can be a traumatic experience for any child. Many kids love their pets\u00a0 very deeply and some may not even remember a time in their life when the pet\u00a0 wasn\u2019t around. A child may feel angry and blame themselves\u2014or you\u2014for the pet\u2019s\u00a0 death. A child may feel scared that other people or animals they love may also\u00a0 leave them. How you handle the grieving process can determine whether the\u00a0 experience has a positive or negative effect on your child\u2019s personal\u00a0 development.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Some parents feel they should try to shield their children\u00a0 from the sadness of losing a pet by either not talking about the pet\u2019s death,\u00a0 or by not being honest about what\u2019s happened. Pretending the animal ran away,\u00a0 or \u201cwent to sleep,\u201d for example, can leave a child feeling even more confused,\u00a0 frightened, and betrayed when they finally learn the truth. It\u2019s far better to\u00a0 be honest with children and allow them the opportunity to grieve in their own\u00a0 way.</strong></span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Tips for a helping a child cope with the loss of a\u00a0 pet</strong></span></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Let your child see you express your own\u00a0 grief at the loss of the pet. If you don\u2019t experience the same sense of\u00a0 loss as your child, respect their grief and let them express their feelings\u00a0 openly, without making them feel ashamed or guilty. Children should feel proud\u00a0 that they have so much compassion and care deeply about their animal\u00a0 companions.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Reassure your child that they weren\u2019t\u00a0 responsible for the pet\u2019s death. The death of a pet can raise a lot of\u00a0 questions and fears in a child. You may need to reassure your child that you,\u00a0 their parents, are not also likely to die. It\u2019s important to talk about all\u00a0 their feelings and concerns.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Involve your child in the dying process. If you\u2019ve chosen euthanasia for your pet, be honest with your child. Explain why\u00a0 the choice is necessary and give the child chance to spend some special time\u00a0 with the pet and say goodbye in his or her own way.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>If possible, give the child an opportunity\u00a0 to create a memento of the pet.

Your choices for your pet should be informed\u00a0 by the care and love you feel for the animal. Important things to consider\u00a0 include:</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Activity\u00a0 level. Does your pet still enjoy previously loved activities or is he/she\u00a0 able to be active at all?</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Response\u00a0 to care and affection. Does your pet still interact and respond to love and\u00a0 care in the usual ways?</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Amount\u00a0 of pain and suffering. Is your pet experiencing pain and suffering which\u00a0 outweigh any pleasure and enjoyment in life?</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Terminal\u00a0 illness or critical injury. Have illness or injury prohibited your pet from\u00a0 enjoying life? Is your pet facing certain death from the injury or illness?</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Your family\u2019s feelings.

You may want to have a last day at\u00a0 home with the pet in order to say goodbye, or to visit the pet at the animal\u00a0 hospital. You can also choose to be present during your pet\u2019s euthanasia, or to\u00a0 say goodbye beforehand and remain in the veterinary waiting room or at home.\u00a0 This is an individual decision for each member of the family.</strong></span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>What to expect when putting your dog or cat to sleep</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>According to the American Veterinary Medical Association, euthanasia\u00a0 for a pet is most often achieved by injection of a death-inducing drug. The\u00a0 veterinarian may administer a tranquilizer first to relax your pet. Following the\u00a0 injection of the euthanasia drug, your pet will immediately become unconscious.\u00a0 Death is quick and painless. Your pet may move its legs or breathe deeply\u00a0 several times after the drug is given, but these are reflexes and don\u2019t mean\u00a0 that your pet is in pain or is suffering.</strong></span></p>\n<div>\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>How to explain pet euthanasia to a child</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Explain that the pet is ill, often suffering, and\u00a0 that you have the ability to end that suffering in a very humane and gentle\u00a0 way. It is a simple injection, very peaceful and painless, and if you really\u00a0 love a pet you have to make these kinds of difficult decisions.</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Children\u00a0 tend to feed off of how their parents react. If a parent is hysterical, the\u00a0 children will be the same. If the parents are truly sad, and deal with the\u00a0 sadness in a healthy and thoughtful manner, the children will follow their\u00a0 example.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>If\u00a0 you are putting your beloved pet to sleep for the right reasons, tell your\u00a0 children that it is OK to feel sad, but don&#8217;t feel guilty. These are two very\u00a0 different emotions. You should feel sad, and your children can feel the sadness,\u00a0 but don&#8217;t mix guilt in with the sadness. One emotion is healthy, the other\u00a0 terribly burdensome.</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Source: <em>Dr. Larry</em></strong></span></p>\n</div>\n<h2><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Getting another dog or cat: Moving on after pet loss</strong></span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>There are many wonderful reasons to once again share your\u00a0 life with a companion animal, but the decision of when to do so is a very\u00a0 personal one.

In most cases, it\u2019s best to\u00a0 mourn the old pet first, and wait until you\u2019re emotionally ready to open your\u00a0 heart and your home to a new animal.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Some retired seniors living alone, however, may find it\u00a0 hardest to adjust to life without a pet. If taking care of an animal provided you\u00a0 with a sense of purpose and self-worth as well as companionship, you may want\u00a0 to consider getting another pet at an earlier stage.

this is inevitable and all we can do is to enforce ground rules and make sure that our kids play age appropriate games. If rules are enforced and game selection is endorsed by adult guardians the better we feel about it and can actually control when and what our kids play.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Do you play video and online games yourself? People of all ages are playing games, actually the average age of a gamer is 33 and apparently a 33 year old player is not interested in Scooby Doo games. So looking at a game page how would you determine the ones that intended for kids?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>First thing you need to do is to carefully read the description on a package. Game content is described in detail on the back of every game box. Make sure you check a game rating on a game&#8217;s package. The Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) is an organization that assigns the ratings that appear on the front and back of every game available for purchase or rental. You have to get familiar with rating symbols and understand what they mean.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>A complete list of ESRB ratings, content descriptions and their definitions are available at ESRB.org, where you can also search for a particular game&#8217;s rating before going to the store.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Secondly younger kids are often asking for games that intended for teens, You have to stand your ground and be firm. By saying &#8220;no&#8221; you are actually enforcing the rules and buy yourself a piece of mind. Unless you know the game inside out and play a particular game intended for teens yourself it is better not to take the risk.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>You also need to consider your child&#8217;s personality and abilities. Go beyond the ratings and read game reviews available online and game magazines, download game demo or rent it for free with online game rental stores. Get involved and play along with your child so you are well aware of his or her interests. Talk to other parents and see what they have to say about a particular game or their kids game habits in general. Join online game forum and post your questions about particular games.

Graphic TV programs, sexually explicit magazines and alcohol all must be kept out of reach.\u00a0 Unfortunately, parents must add another pop culture challenge to their list: video games. A recent study by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) shows that more than 90 percent of parents don&#8217;t monitor ratings on the video games played by their kids. Many are unaware that a ratings system for video games even exists, and children probably know more about the rating system than their parents do. Worse yet, parents may not know that the content of certain games could affect the social and emotional development of their child, and may even be hazardous to children&#8217;s health.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Unfortunately, parents must add another pop culture challenge to their list: video games.\u00a0 A recent study by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) shows that more than 90 percent of parents don&#8217;t monitor ratings on the video games played by their kids.\u00a0 Many are unaware that a ratings system for video games even exists, and children probably know more about the rating system than their parents do.

All but 18 of the studies have shown that the more violence one sees, the more likely one is to be violent. According to the AAP, depictions of violence that are realistic, portrayed without pain and suffering, and experienced in the context of good feelings are more likely to be emulated.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">On April 20, 1999, two heavily armed adolescent boys walked into Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado and shot 12 of their classmates and a teacher to death. Then they killed themselves. When authorities investigated, they discovered that the boys had played thousands of hours of a &#8220;first-person shooter&#8221; video game that had been modified to occur in a layout identical to that of their high school, with yearbook pictures electronically pasted onto the game&#8217;s imaginary victims. What led these boys to deliberately kill their fellow students is complicated and no single reason has been identified as the cause.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">One of the questions parents asked after the Columbine shooting was:\u00a0 &#8220;How could it be that the parents did not know their children were playing such heinous video games?&#8221;\u00a0 The answer is that parents are not familiar with video games because they don&#8217;t play them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Parents <i>don&#8217;t know</i> that video games that have a mature rating may contain content that is entirely inappropriate for children under the age of 17. <i> They don&#8217;t know</i> that a child playing an M-rated game can actively participate in the simulated murder of police officers, women, minorities and innocent bystanders.\u00a0 These acts are graphically depicted and include victims being shot, beaten to death, decapitated, burned alive and urinated on.\u00a0 These games may also present favorable depictions of prostitution, racism, misogyny and drug use.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Parents <i>do know</i> that children learn by observing, imitating what they observe, and acting on the world around them.\u00a0 According to child psychologist Michael Rich, children develop what psychologists call &#8220;behavioral scripts.&#8221; They interpret their experiences and respond to others using those scripts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">One can easily see how repeated exposure to violent behavioral scripts can lead to increased feelings of hostility, expectation that others will behave aggressively, desensitization to the pain of others, and an increased likelihood of interacting and responding to others with violence.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Violent video games are an ideal environment in which to learn violence. Violent video games:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">place the player in the role of the aggressor and reward him or her for violent behavior.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">allow the player to rehearse an entire behavioral script from provocation to choosing a violent resolution of conflict.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">are addictive \u2014 kids want to play them for hours to improve their playing skills, and repetition increases learning.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Parents already know they must be aware of the television and movies their children watch. Now they must be aware of the content of the video games their children play at home and in the homes of their friends.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">To educate parents and guardians about the content of video games, Mothers Against Violence in America invites parents to join the Campaign for a Game Smart Community and learn about the content and rating system.

With a tiger-leap half-way, now she meets the coming prey. lets it go as fast, and then; Has it in her power again.

Many parents feel that their kids work better at different times of the day than what a public or private school allows for. So, home schooling allows parents and children to work out a schedule that will best work for the child. Some children work best and learn best in the morning, noon, or evening, so being able to set the learning schedule up in a way that allows the child o succeed is definitely an advantage.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Varied Learning Subjects. In public and private schools there is a set curriculum that each subject must abide by, so by home schooling you are able to control which areas of the different subjects you want to put more emphasis on. This, also, allows you to add courses into the home school curriculum that a normal, say, third grader would not get in organized classes.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Flexibility in Time. You can set your child&#8217;s learning curriculum around vacations, illnesses, and other surprise events. Where in a public school, children tend to be allotted so many days they can miss without both the child and the parents getting into trouble.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Flexibility in Curriculum. There is, also a certain flexibility around what is taught, not just when. If you go to a public event or on home school field trip, your children may have questions about the topic at hand. Home schooling allows for a break in the normal curriculum so that you can further discuss and do activities towards the questions in a more in- depth manner.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Knowing Your Kids. This is the biggest advantage of home schooling. You are able to enjoy your children and watch them grow and learn on a daily basis. Home schooling allows you to really get to know your kids on a whole different level than packing them on the bus for school in the mornings.</strong></span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></div>\n<div>\n<div id=\"mod_843718\">\n<div id=\"imgs_843718\">\n<div id=\"img_url_227798\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><img class=\"aligncenter\" title=\"Flickr Image: Creative Loafer\" alt=\"Flickr Image: Creative Loafer\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/s1.hubimg.com/u/227798_f248.jpg\" width=\"248\" height=\"181\" /></strong></span></p>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div id=\"mod_843719\">\n<h2 style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>5 <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Disadvantages to Home Schooling</span></strong></span></h2>\n<div id=\"txtd_843719\">\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Not Enough Time. Because home schooling your kids is really a full time job, you just may not have enough time in the day to do what you need to get done. You have to full research topics and prepare lessons, set up projects and field trips. You will have to spend time keeping yourself organized, and on top of all that, you have to teach.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>No Time for Work. Because home schooling takes up a lot of time in preparation and delivery, you may run out of time for house hold duties and chores.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Personal Space. When home schooling your kids, you will have to give a lot of yourself away. You will pretty much loose your personal, quiet time. So, if you opt to home school your kids, make sure to schedule in time each day for yourself.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>A Lot of Pressure. Because everyone has their own unique style to home schooling, you may end up finding yourself comparing your techniques with those of other parents. This can put a lot of pressure on you to up the anti, so to speak.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>They Just Don&#8217;t Listen. Parents who do not have regular control over their kids, may feel overwhelmed with the decision to home school. In these situations, you will just run yourself ragged running after the kids, preparing lessons, cleaning the house, and maybe even running that home business. Make sure that you have control over your children&#8217;s behaviors before you decide to home school.</strong></span></li>\n<li><strong><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">TELL US &#8211; \u00a0WHAT DO YOU\u00a0THINK &#8211; \u00a0LEAVE A COMMENT?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 START A DISCUSSION</span></strong></li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n", "post_id": 2725, "location": false, "date": "03-18-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<div class=\"wpcom-reblog-snapshot\"> <div class=\"reblog-post\"><p class=\"reblog-from\"><img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/89ac7a81465a9725dc450abd498a1f31?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />Originally posted on <a href=\"http://thesurvivalplaceblog.com/2014/03/14/pros-and-cons-of-homeschooling-for-shtf/\">TheSurvivalPlaceBlog</a>:</p><div class=\"reblogged-content\">\n<a href=\"http://preparedforthat.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/homeschooling-zombies.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://preparedforthat.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/homeschooling-zombies.jpg\" height=\"338\" width=\"450\" alt=\"homeschooling-zombies\"></a>\n\n<p>By <a href=\"http://preparedforthat.com/author/jsjohnson151/\" title=\"Josh\">Josh</a></p>\n\n<p>There is a growing movement amongst preppers to homeschool as a preparatory measure prior to a potential disaster or emergency situation. They argue that the experience is beneficial for both kids and parents, and it permits them to better prepare their entire family for what may come. However, there are others who claim that the expense, time, and effort might be too much compared to the advantages gained. As I myself benefited from both public and home schooling during my young life, I thought I\u2019d give interested prepping parents a helpful guide to see if homeschooling would give them sufficient advantage to be worth the costs.</p>\n\n<p><strong>A quick definition of the common types of schooling</strong></p>\n\n<p>You may already be well aware of what \u201chomeschooling\u201d looks like vs what public schooling does, but let me clarify things real quick:</p>\n\n<ul><li>\n<strong>Homeschooling.\u00a0</strong>Teaching your kids at home, where one or both\u2026</li></ul>\n</div><p class=\"reblog-source\"><a href=\"http://thesurvivalplaceblog.com/2014/03/14/pros-and-cons-of-homeschooling-for-shtf/\">View original</a> <span class=\"more-words\">750 more words</span></p></div></div>", "post_id": 2727, "location": false, "date": "03-18-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["allaboutmanners allaboutmanners animals aviation books breakfast cars children climate cooking dessert FAMILY food frog gaming Gillian Sims good manners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners"], "text": "<article id=\"post-15\">\n<header>\n<h1><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><a href=\"http://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/home-scool-2.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2730 aligncenter\" alt=\"HOME SCOOL 2\" src=\"https://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/home-scool-2.jpg?w=160&#038;h=158\" width=\"160\" height=\"158\" /></a></span></h1>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Standard</strong></span></header>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><!-- .entry-header --></span></p>\n<div>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Home schooling is a method where kids learn out of interest and curiosity and not to please the adults in power. It is to provide an educational program to an individual outside of established schools or any other educational institution. It is one of most rapidly growing trends in education in the United States.</strong></span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>How Did It Start?</strong></span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>It is not known when exactly it was started. Flipping the pages of history, we notice that almost all the great rulers like Alexander The Great and the royal class kids were home schooled. It was said that public schools were failing and will continue to fail since it does not deliver a satisfactory quality of education.</strong></span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Is It The Right Choice?</strong></span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>\u201dWhy to home school when public schools are available?\u201d This must be the question lingering in your mind. Well, home is the most effective place where one learns the basic lessons of life \u2013 truth, honor, self-control, self-respect, the value of education, virtue, honest work and the purpose and privilege of life. There is no other place other than home in nurturing and teaching children.</strong></span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>The Environment</strong></span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>The most decisive element to a successful home schooling is the ambiance that is conducive to learning. The environment may differ but the result would be the same, i.e. kids would enjoy learning. It is up to the parents how creatively they prepare it for their kids. The corners of learning may have quiet and cozy reading space, bookshelves crammed with great books, a listening corner with headphones and bean bags, and a number of activity books. So there it is, you get the idea! Creating such a space makes learning fun.</strong></span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Why Is It Better?</strong></span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>The primary reason is dissatisfaction from public education system.

It takes 2 to 3 hours on a daily basis to devote to your child\u2019s curriculum. It is a hard work and a big responsibility providing home education to your children. It is ultimately you who is responsible for the child, and not any other person or organization.

It gives your child to learn at his/her own pace.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>There is time and schedule flexibility. A child is not confined to the academic calendar. Scheduling vacations and trips any time would not be a problem.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Parents can control the academic curriculum according to the child\u2019s learning capacity.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Parents are secured about the kind of education being provided to the child and the child will be under their guidance all the time.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Custom and design the time table according to the needs of the child.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Home schooled kids are less aggressive and are more tolerant.</strong></span></li>\n</ol>\n<h4><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong><em>Disadvantages</em></strong></span></h4>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Home schooling would affect the family income as full time employment would be difficult.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>It is important to love your children and be \u2018you\u2019. If you cannot be yourself, your kids are better off in school.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Big money is spent on family and since there are kids with you all the time, you will end up buying more and more books.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Home schooling is time consuming, dynamic and intense.

We forget the sacrifices they \u2019ve made for us, and the effort it takes to raise happy, healthy children. Respect is foundational to love, and one of the best ways to show your parents that you love them is to treat them with respect. Small habits that you can incorporate into your daily routine, and a loving and positive attitude will make them feel loved and respected, and proud to have you as their child.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Parents and children always will have some level of conflict, but mutual respect helps minimize hurt feelings and animosity resulting from family tensions. Children should respect their parents authority, but parents should also respect their children&#8217;s value and age-appropriate choices. When parents and children avoid harsh words, belittling comments and loose tempers, conflicts can often be resolved quickly and effectively.</strong></span></p>\n<div id=\"DMINSTR\">\n<div id=\"google-article-single\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?ct=abg&amp;q=https://www.google.com/adsense/support/bin/request.py%3Fcontact%3Dabg_afc%26url%3Dhttp://everydaylife.globalpost.com/importance-mutual-respect-between-parents-children-4031.html%26gl%3DGB%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dca-pub-3235755782694080%26ai0%3DCkfP5rzUwU_fKGMmplALd7IHAC7KIpqQEkufyy3zAjbcBEAEg3Y-QGFCG3Km_A2C7pq2D0AqgAdKKuvsDyAEBqAMBqgStAU_QOVEv_QPrdjGOmcAli0Lh2hYNneSe0FWtFfgjCyXRejpdvbHQbbYRPt40efHE1p-2608Fy4HB5UB-RIbcONlnvH7Q8HYVNOs440ZUmDMeyoOxpTTC4PcitCo67mSuqm1VSmuvWQc0pOhMmpXGodCk4cOVq69DSEuCybsUknbfrua5yabWNpRCD6Uu3lZnQk1O71n7jVK1MeJPo2UTJNBmPEi-WG_7OzNLuH-1iAYBgAeW9cUE&amp;usg=AFQjCNH0gF4w8VGUZn5UFzCrgn79rIknAA\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">\u00a0</span></a></strong></span></div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"section-1\">\n<h2><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Equality</strong></span></h2>\n<div id=\"section-1\">\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Mutual respect encourages equality in the home. Even though parents know more because they have more life experiences to draw from, and they have legal authority in the home, they shouldn&#8217;t use their elevated positions to dominate their children. Children have intrinsic value and deserve to be treated with kindness and respect, without feeling as though their parents control every move they make. According to Lane Community College, mutual respect is the key to improving relationships between parents and children. Creating a system where parents and children work together to establish ground rules, promote healthy communication habits, encourage age-appropriate decisions and share household chores can lead to a happier home life. Parents might need to enforce the rules, but children respond to fair and consistent expectations.</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"section-2\">\n<h2><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Closeness</strong></span></h2>\n<div id=\"section-2\">\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>A family that encourages mutual respect is likely to be a close family. According to Brigham Young University professor Larry Nelson, a parenting style that blends love, high expectations and respect for a child\u2019s autonomy lasts for years, long after the child moves out of the home. Specifically, dads who promote mutual respect enjoy closer relationships with their children, and their children have higher levels of self-worth, according to the Psych Central website. Mutual respect shows a child that you respect his independence, personal interests and time. Most importantly, it teaches a child that you love him unconditionally and find value in his existence.</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"section-3\">\n<h2><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Healthy Communication</strong></span></h2>\n<div id=\"section-3\">\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Healthy communication reinforces mutual respect between parents and children. The Empowering Parents website encourages parents to listen to their kids and strive to reconcile if their children feel mistreated. Parents can demonstrate respect by asking their kids to forgive them if they say something that&#8217;s harsh, critical or unfair. According to the site, healthy communication creates mutual respect because it gives children the opportunity to see their parents as flawed human beings who make mistakes. Parents and children who ask for forgiveness, express honest emotions and show compassion create a respectful atmosphere.</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"section-4\">\n<h2><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Conflict Resolution</strong></span></h2>\n<div id=\"section-4\">\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Mutual respect leads to quick and effective conflict resolution. If a respectful parent says, &#8220;I&#8217;m disappointed with your actions, but I&#8217;d like to know what&#8217;s bothering you,&#8221; a child might soften, knowing that the parent truly cares. If a respectful child says, &#8220;I don&#8217;t understand why I can&#8217;t go to the party, but I trust your judgment,&#8221; a parent might use the opportunity to share her concerns about the child&#8217;s peers or questionable activities. Mutual respect means both parents and children get to express their feelings, and both are willing to listen to the other&#8217;s point of view.</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n", "post_id": 2765, "location": false, "date": "03-24-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<div class=\"wpcom-reblog-snapshot\"> <div class=\"reblog-post\"><p class=\"reblog-from\"><img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/4797180d2ad5a42b2853e42cbd19353e?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />Originally posted on <a href=\"http://time.com/33438/6-things-overprotective-parents-do-wrong/\">TIME</a>:</p><div class=\"reblogged-content\">\n<p>Anyone who\u2019s ever been to a school science fair and seen the elaborate projects that obviously weren\u2019t conceived by a child\u2019s brain knows that parents are more involved than ever.

Back then, in university, it was real cool to smoke. Almost everyone did, and those who didn&#8217;t were &#8216;not in&#8217;.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>I started with a stick, smoked after dinner on my parents&#8217; 2nd floor balcony, where the wind could blow the smoke away. Inhaling hurt my head, the smoke hurt my nose and throat. But I continued to smoke and increased frequency. In 5 years, when I started to work, I was smoking a pack of Marlboro reds a day. For a year or so during &amp; after my first pregnancy, I did stop smoking &#8220;for the sake of my daughter&#8221;. I continued to smoke for the next 23 years, and built up to 2 packs a day, having short clean periods when I had colds. I&#8217;d try to extend these &#8220;dry&#8221;spells, but I always ended taking up the habit again.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>In a way, I was outwardly proud of my smoking, as if it was a life achievement. Yet deep inside, I wanted to kick it off my system. I was starting to weaken. My dad hated my smell as I tended to him on his death bed. The scent stuck to all my clothes. Some of my officemates would stick pictures of blackened lungs on the corkboard beside my desk, or in my drawer. And my daughters were getting paranoid they&#8217;d get cancer in their teens from inhaling second hand smoke. I know I tried my best to quit, but my will just seemed to be totally uncooperative. I&#8217;d go &#8216;clean&#8217; for a few weeks, only to start again. Those episodes started to become a boring series of failed attempts.</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"mod_955718\" class=\"module moduleImage\">\n<div id=\"imgs_955718\">\n<div id=\"img_url_260478\" class=\"inline_hub_image fullWidth\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><img class=\"full\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/s1.hubimg.com/u/260478_f520.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"520\" height=\"326\" /></strong></span></div>\n<div id=\"img_desc_260478\" class=\"caption_full\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"mod_956346\" class=\"module moduleText color0\">\n<div id=\"txtd_956346\" class=\"txtd\">\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Accepting the problem and asking for help</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Strange things do happen. About 20 years since I lit that first stick of cigarette in my parents&#8217; home, I started to seriously look for ways to stop smoking. I started to dance again, and eventually teach dance, hoping the necessity to keep fit would inspire me to keep off the smokes. Yet, I always reverted back to a habit that I was starting to really detest.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Then in 1998, I surfed the net, looking for other people who had kicked the habit, to learn how they did it, and if I could perhaps copy their experience. I left several pages open at a time, and clicked on a vaguely familiar name &#8211; Eckankar. I knew I&#8217;d seen it before, and it felt as if I had known it for ages. I was intrigued by words that seemed to rise from the screen, engrossing words that seemed to mirror beliefs I didn&#8217;t realize I had till then. I stuck on the point that God sends messages to each one of us through the Holy Spirit in the form of words that we read, or conversations with others, or some other form. I felt a peculiar lightness and knowingness as I read and openly accepted Eckankar&#8217;s basic philosophy, so much so that I felt the urge to resume my research on spirituality which I had started almost a decade earlier. Eventually, I requested Eckankar for a free intro book.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>I continued to check out another site, and as I stretched out for a break, I realized that I had not smoked a cigarette for more than an hour. My last one, I estimated, was right before I clicked on the Eckankar website. Right there and then, I resolved to quit smoking (again, for the nth time)., This time however, I consciously called on my God to help me do it. I practically verbalized my plea:\u00a0<em>Please dear God, I really want to quit this terrible bad habit, which I&#8217;ve been trying to for so many years. Maybe with your help, I can finally do it. No, I believe that with your help I can finally do it. Surely I haven&#8217;t been able to stop smoking on my own. But I know you can actually help me. Please God, help me quit smoking now. Thank you for your help in advance.\u00a0</em>I repeated my plea in various words over the next minutes. And for the first time, I knew I&#8217;d be able to finally quit smoking.</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"floatclear\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></div>\n<div class=\"modfloat right\">\n<div id=\"mod_957186\" class=\"module moduleImage\">\n<div id=\"imgs_957186\">\n<div id=\"img_url_260965\" class=\"inline_hub_image quarterWidth\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><img class=\"quarter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/s2.hubimg.com/u/260965_f120.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"120\" height=\"123\" /></strong></span></div>\n<div id=\"img_desc_260965\" class=\"caption_half\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"modfloat full\">\n<div id=\"mod_957095\" class=\"module moduleText color0\">\n<div id=\"txtd_957095\" class=\"txtd\">\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>The Turning Point</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>As I telepathically talked with God, I cleaned out my ashtray of cigarette butts into the waste basket. Knowing I had to put in my share of the work as I asked for God&#8217;s help, I threw in the ashtray too. I hesitated a second before I took the rest of the unlit cigarettes, broke and mashed each one and threw them in with the ashes and crumpled packs. Next I went through my drawers to collect all my lighters, matches, and rest of the remaining 6 packs of cigarettes. I opened each one, still talking with God, asking for support and strength, promising that I will try to do my part, broke each cigarette, and threw them in with the rest. I now ended. with a basket full of mashed unlit cigarettes. Temptation was starting to set in. I got the urge to reach into the basket for a fairly intact stick. I stood up, took the basket, walked down the 4 flights of stairs from my loft to the ground floor of our condominium building, and emptied my basket into the huge trash bin.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>I gave the basket a last hard knock to make sure every single cigarette was in the bin. Then I heaved a big sigh, and could feel myself patting myself on the back. &#8220;Great girl, you did it.&#8221; But soon as took the first step up the stairs, I felt remorse, and questioned myself why I did such a stupid thing. Then this other part of me started shooing the remorse away. I talked to God in my mind again, as I struggled up the stairs. When I reached the door, I knew for sure that I had passed my first test.

The first test came some months after I actually quit. I took the proffered stick, put it in my mouth, lit a match but did not light the cigarette. I had remembered my promise to God just in time. On the second test, about a year later, I stuck the cigarette in my mouth, but never lit it. The third test came on the fourth year, and the final one was on the 7th or so year. In both dreams, I sat among smokers, not a bit tempted nor bothered.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Today, our home is totally smoke-free. My husband quit 5 years ago. I feel my lungs have opened and cleared up. I have joined and enjoy singing with our alumnae chorale singing and dancing for charity. My husband has taken to biking regularly.

Smoking is very addictive because tobacco contains a powerful drug called nicotine. Smokers have also been influenced by the clever marketing tactics of tobacco companies for many years.</strong></span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>Nicotine as a drug</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>Cigarettes are deliberately designed to give you a fast nicotine hit. It takes just 10 seconds for the drug to reach your brain from inhaled cigarette smoke. Nicotine causes addiction in much the same way as heroin or cocaine. It is just as addictive as these \u2018harder\u2019 drugs.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>Nicotine is a stimulant that increases your heart rate and affects many different parts of your brain and body. Smokers get a high because nicotine triggers the release of dopamine in the brain &#8211; a chemical linked to feelings of pleasure.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>This also means that smokers start to make a mental link between the act of smoking and feeling good. Because of this, smokers can also become addicted to abstract things like the taste of cigarettes or the feeling of smoking, as well as the nicotine itself.</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"panel width-00 bg-none\">\n<div class=\"header\"><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></div>\n<div class=\"body\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<h3><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>Withdrawal symptoms</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>Addiction explains why giving up smoking can cause nicotine withdrawal symptoms. These symptoms include cravings, irritability, anxiety, difficulty concentrating, restlessness and disturbed sleep.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>As your body adjusts to the lack of nicotine, these symptoms will start to disappear and most will go away within a month. Withdrawal symptoms can be difficult to cope but the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/cancer-info/healthyliving/smokingandtobacco/whydopeoplesmoke/ssNODELINK/SmokingAndCancerReasonsToQuit\"><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\">benefits to your health</span></a>\u00a0are well worth it.</strong></span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>Nicotine as a poison</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>Nicotine is a neurotoxin (a poison that kills nerve cells) found in tobacco plants. It acts as a defence mechanism to stop them from being eaten by animals.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>However, in cigarettes, the level of nicotine is too low to cause poisoning. And the nicotine in\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/cancer-info/healthyliving/smokingandtobacco/whydopeoplesmoke/ssNODELINK/SmokingAndCancerGivingUp\"><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\">nicotine replacement therapy (NRT)</span></a>\u00a0is a safe way to come off the nicotine in cigarettes. Using NRT can double your chances of successfully quitting.</strong></span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>Tobacco advertising and promotion</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>Half of smokers die from smoking-related diseases. The tobacco industry needs new customers to replace the 114,000 people who are killed by smoking in the UK each year. Cigarette manufacturers make sure that:</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>they know exactly why people smoke</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>they cleverly market products to attract new customers.</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>In the past cigarette manufacturers have deliberately targeted children and young people. The industry spends a great deal of money on making cigarettes seem glamorous, appealing, fashionable and attractive. Most smokers started when they were young and image conscious. Young smokers often find it difficult to give up in later life.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>Cigarette advertising is now banned in the UK. So the industry is developing new and subtle tactics to avoid prosecution.</strong></span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>Stress and relaxation</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>Many people claim that smoking helps them to cope with stress. But in fact, nicotine is a stimulant and won\u2019t help you to relax. Smokers probably think a cigarette makes them feel better because when they aren\u2019t smoking they suffer from nicotine withdrawal.</strong></span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>Other personal reasons for smoking</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>People have many other personal reasons for smoking. Smokers may:</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>use smoking as a support for when things go wrong</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>enjoy smoking with others as a shared activity</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>use smoking to start conversations and meet new people</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>smoke to make themselves look more confident and in control</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>think that cigarettes help them to keep their weight down</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>have a cigarette when they\u2019re feeling bored or lonely</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>smoke when they need a break or a moment to themselves.</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>Knowing why you smoke is one of the first steps towards\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/cancer-info/healthyliving/smokingandtobacco/whydopeoplesmoke/ssNODELINK/SmokingAndCancerGivingUp\"><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\">giving up</span></a>.</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n", "post_id": 2810, "location": false, "date": "03-27-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<div class=\"wpcom-reblog-snapshot\"> <div class=\"reblog-post\"><p class=\"reblog-from\"><img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/88f3e4fc7d7362b83122e38889480910?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />Originally posted on <a href=\"http://thoughtcatalog.com/%tc-coauthor%/2014/03/a-thank-you-letter-to-dads-from-their-grown-up-daughters/\">Thought Catalog</a>:</p><div class=\"reblogged-content\">\n<p>Dear Dad,</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for holding me tight as a baby, even though it might have seemed like you were denying strangers the pleasure of holding me \u2014 I know you just wanted to protect me.

Here are my top 4 tips to remember when planning the festivities.</strong></span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0How Inviting!</strong></span></h2>\n<p class=\"yiv6302906227MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>Invitations and announcements will be your best friend and first foyer into the birthday-protocol realm. Do you want guests to bring gifts? If you don\u2019t, but have an alternative (such as a charitable donation that can be made in lieu of a present) say so on the invites. Besides the event date, time (I\u2019d suggest 2-3 hours max), RSVP-by date and gift situation, make sure to list any other pertinent information (like bring a swimsuit!).</strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"yiv6302906227MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>Do you have long distance family/friends that you know won\u2019t be able to attend? I suggest sending them an\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.tinyprints.com/shop/first_birthday_invitations.htm?cid=SEM-TP-Google-Core&amp;crid=28043168845&amp;campaignidinkenshoo=13822&amp;adgroupidinkenshoo=1966872&amp;kw=unique%20first%20birthday%20invitations&amp;mType=b&amp;networkType=search&amp;gclid=CNbnjNmRwL0CFTMV7AodkRIAUw&amp;mpch=ads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\">announcement</span></a>\u00a0(Look who\u2019s turning 1!) rather than a formal invite. This way, they don\u2019t feel 1) guilty for not being able to attend and 2) like you are trying to sucker a gift out of them (if, by chance, you are accepting presents). This leads me to my second tip\u2026</strong></span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Present Situation</strong></span></h2>\n<p class=\"yiv6302906227MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>If guests take the time to pick out, purchase, and wrap a gift for your baby\u2019s special day\u2014open it in front of them! It\u2019s a given that the little ones won\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, but the adults that brought the presents sure do. This will give you an opportunity to issue a verbal thank you while offering the giving-parties the chance to see your (favorable\u2014of course) reaction. Make sure to allow for ample time and room to do this; otherwise, don\u2019t accept gifts.</strong></span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0May the Odds be Ever in your Favor(s)</strong></span></h2>\n<p id=\"yui_3_13_0_1_1396469492422_3865\" class=\"yiv6302906227MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>Favors are the golden standard at every celebration from weddings to baby showers. Your little one\u2019s first birthday is no exception; guest favors must make an appearance. Fortunately, there are plenty of options to accommodate any budget. Sacks with homemade cookies, crayons and coloring books, and more nifty ideas (<a href=\"http://www.1stwishes.com/categorypage/1st-birthday-party-favors_8+52.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\">like these ones here</span></a>) are all perfectly acceptable ways to give your guests a special thank you. Have fun with favors by incorporating them into your theme (if you have one) and make sure to make a couple extra!</strong></span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What do you say?</strong></span></h2>\n<p id=\"yui_3_13_0_1_1396469492422_3864\" class=\"yiv6302906227MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>A verbal thank-you is not sufficient; it is imperative that you take the time to write a thoughtful thank-you note. Designate somebody at your baby\u2019s big day to keep track of gifts (who it\u2019s from and what it is) so that nothing gets lost in the moment. This is a common courtesy that, unfortunately, isn\u2019t always very common. Leading by example is a fantastic way to perpetuate this form of gratitude, and as your baby grows, don\u2019t hesitate to incorporate them into the process until they (one day) will do them all on their own.</strong></span></p>\n<p id=\"yui_3_13_0_1_1396469492422_3863\" class=\"yiv6302906227MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>Though these steps seem simple (and easy to gloss over) they will make a positive impact on your guests, and pave the way for your up-and-coming future generations.</strong></span></p>\n<p id=\"yui_3_13_0_1_1396469492422_3856\" class=\"yiv6302906227MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<p id=\"yui_3_13_0_1_1396469492422_3857\" class=\"yiv6302906227MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong><a id=\"yui_3_13_0_1_1396469492422_3862\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/1/104201180664512618097/posts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\">Gwendy Taylor</span></a>\u00a0is a first-time mom discovering that no matter how many times she double checks the diaper bag, she always forgets something important.

Many kids and teens who self-harm also struggle with depression,\u00a0<a title=\"anxiety\" href=\"http://psychcentral.com/disorders/anxiety/\"><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\">anxiety</span></a>, eating disorders, physical abuse or other serious concerns or psychological disorders.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>These kids \u201cdon\u2019t know how to verbalize their feelings, and instead, act them out by self-injuring,\u201d Serani writes. Kids might self-harm to soothe deep sadness or other overwhelming emotions. They might do it to express self-loathing or shame. They might do it to express negative thoughts they can\u2019t articulate. They might do it because they feel helpless.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>Research has found that self-harm is an addictive behavior. \u201cClinical studies link the role of opiates. When a child self-harms these feel-good endorphins flood the bloodstream. The rush is so pleasing that a child learns to associate self-harm as soothing, instead of being destructive,\u201d\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.drdeborahserani.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\">Serani</span></a>\u00a0writes.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>Self-harm is called non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) because there\u2019s no intention to commit suicide. However, as Serani cautions in her book, self-injury can lead to deliberate suicide.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>If you notice signs of self-harm, take your child to a therapist for a professional evaluation. A therapist will determine whether self-harm is suicidal or non-suicidal by administering a suicide assessment (and ascertain if other concerns are present). They\u2019ll also teach your child healthy techniques for dealing with painful emotions or situations.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>In addition to taking your child to see a mental health professional, there are other ways you can help them reduce the urge to self-harm. In\u00a0<em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Depression-Your-Child-Parents-Caregivers/dp/1442221453/?tag=psychcentral\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\">Depression and Your Child</span></a></em>, Serani lists these valuable tips.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>1. Create a coping kit.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>Put positive and uplifting items in a shoebox or another container, which your child can use when they get the urge to self-harm. This can be anything from a journal to art supplies to upbeat music to photos of friends, family or their heroes. Include anything your child finds calming or inspiring.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>2. Model positive imagery.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>Visualizing a beautiful, serene place is a great way to reduce anxiety or painful emotions. When you practice positive imagery in front of your child you help them strengthen these skills. Serani suggests talking aloud as you describe a soothing landscape \u2013 like a beach \u2013 or positive memories of a place you\u2019ve been to. Use vivid details in your descriptions. \u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>3. Talk about triggers.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>Help your child better understand the types of situations and stressors that trigger their negative feelings. As Serani notes, \u201cIf it\u2019s a test coming up in school, a social event or a dentist appointment, talk about how the days leading up to it can feel stressful.\u201d This helps your child be prepared and have the necessary skills at their disposal. Also, talk about your personal triggers and the healthy ways you cope.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>4. Suggest using less severe behaviors.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>If the urge to self-harm is still present, Serani suggests \u201cusing less severe activities,\u201d such as \u201cholding an ice cube, tearing paper, shredding a sheet, snapping a rubber band, sucking a lemon peel and pounding a pillow.\u201d</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>5. Suggest engaging in physical activities.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>According to Serani, the rush of adrenaline in physical activities, such as running, dancing and playing chase with their pet, actually produces the same chemical surge that self-injury does.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>6. Be compassionate about setbacks.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>Stopping self-harming behavior isn\u2019t easy, and it\u2019ll take time. Your child may have setbacks. The best approach if a setback occurs is to offer nonjudgmental support. \u201cResearch shows that shame, criticism, or overreaction when parents see a wound causes children to withdraw back into self-harming behaviors,\u201d Serani writes.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>Again, if you think your child is self-harming, make an appointment with a therapist for a professional assessment, and support them in practicing healthy coping strategies.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>Overcoming self-harm isn\u2019t easy, but, with effective intervention, your child can stop these behaviors and get better. The key is to get help.</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n", "post_id": 2888, "location": false, "date": "04-03-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<div class=\"wpcom-reblog-snapshot\"> <div class=\"reblog-post\"><p class=\"reblog-from\"><img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/050dd2273ef90697d953934334f75c97?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />Originally posted on <a href=\"http://chaaidaani.wordpress.com/2014/04/03/are-parents-responsible-for-their-children-committing-suicide/\">chaaidaani</a>:</p><div class=\"reblogged-content\">\n<p>By Farahnaz Zahidi<br>\nApril 3rd, 2014</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://blogs.tribune.com.pk/story/21749/are-parents-responsible-for-their-children-committing-suicide/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blogs.tribune.com.pk/story/21749/are-parents-responsible-for-their-children-committing-suicide/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/kid.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1080\" src=\"http://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/kid.jpg?w=610&#038;h=457\" height=\"457\" width=\"610\" alt=\"kid\"></a><br>\nEvery year Pakistan has cases where young adults and even children commit suicide due to the pressure of getting good grades and being high-performers.<br>\n\u201cHum maaon ko sub kuch chahiye\u2026 sub kuch.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>(We mothers need everything\u2026 everything).</p>\n\n<p>That is how disturbing certain advertisements aired on TV today are.

According to the co-author of\u00a0<em>Empowering Underachievers</em> Peter A. Spevak, Ph.D., one out of ten children has trouble finishing huge tasks like homework and chores.

Children get a \u201cbookmark\u201d on which they can list five books they have read, or had read to them. Once the list is complete, they bring it in and receive a free book and get to pick a toy outta the box behind the counter as well. I love encouraging reading in children. I feel like it is underappreciated, and I couldn\u2019t imagine a life without books. I want to pass that love down to my kids, and although I don\u2019t see any problem with that being hard to do (they LOVE books), I certainly appreciate every little thing that helps the encouragement. Kudos to this program, this Mama approves.</p>\n</div><p class=\"reblog-source\"><a href=\"http://pm11887.wordpress.com/2014/04/04/young-readers/\">View original</a></p></div></div>", "post_id": 2897, "location": false, "date": "04-04-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["food", "food waste", "allaboutmanners allaboutmanners animals aviation books breakfast cars children climate cooking dessert FAMILY food frog allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners "], "text": "<h3><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0<a href=\"http://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/mountain.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-2906\" src=\"https://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/mountain.jpg?w=415&#038;h=279\" alt=\"mountain\" width=\"415\" height=\"279\" /></a></strong></span></h3>\n<h5><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>At the Store</strong></span></h5>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>1.\u00a0Shop smart.

Likewise, try buying grains, nuts, and spices from bulk bins so you can measure out exactly what you need and don\u2019t over-buy (Just note that there&#8217;s a difference between buying in bulk and buying from bulk bins; the first one can actually create\u00a0<em>more</em>\u00a0waste if we buy more than we can realistically use).

Whether we are referring to anorexia, bulimia or an addiction to food itself, these illnesses can severely affect quality of life and \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0some can even be deadly. Some recent new stories illustrate how prevalent these conditions are in our society.</span></p>\n<h4 style=\"font-weight:bold;color:#2980b9 !important;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,255);\">The Main Types of Eating Disorders</span></h4>\n<p style=\"color:#444444;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,255);\">Most medical professionals divide the types of food-related illnesses into three classifications. While each is different in its nature, it is important to appreciate that self-esteem, body image and mental health are all the primary contributing factors.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color:#444444;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,255);\"><strong style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Anorexia</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"color:#444444;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,255);\">The first type of illness is known as anorexia. This condition is characterized by extreme food restriction, a distorted body image and the compulsive fear of gaining weight. Sufferers will severely limit their food intake while never being satisfied that they are thin enough. More information on this condition is available on the Advice 4 Consumers\u2019\u00a0<a style=\"color:#0088cc;\" title=\"Anorexia\" href=\"http://www.advice4consumers.net/health/anorexia/\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,255);\">anorexia\u00a0</span></a>page.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color:#444444;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,255);\"><strong style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Bulimia</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"color:#444444;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,255);\">Bulimia is another common illness. This mental health disorder is defined by an individual eating large amounts of food (known as binge eating) only to subsequently purge this food in the form of vomiting. Once again, one of the underlying causes is the irrational compulsion to lose weight. Side effects will not only be the insufficient uptake of nutrients but the possible erosion of the oesophagus and increased rates of tooth decay. Further information on bulimia is available on our\u00a0<a style=\"color:#0088cc;\" title=\"Bulimia\" href=\"http://www.advice4consumers.net/health/bulimia/\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,255);\">bulimia\u00a0</span></a>page.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color:#444444;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,255);\"><strong style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Compulsive Eating</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"color:#444444;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,255);\">On the other end of the spectrum, some individuals engage in compulsive eating. This food addiction causes a sufferer to ingest unhealthy portions of food at one sitting. The result can be massive weight gain, unhealthy levels of cholesterol and potential heart problems. Note that binge eating can also fall into this category.</span></p>\n<h4 style=\"font-weight:bold;color:#2980b9 !important;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,255);\">Symptoms</span></h4>\n<p style=\"color:#444444;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,255);\">Some common warning signs that someone may suffer from these conditions can include:</span></p>\n<ul style=\"color:#0f0f0f;\">\n<li style=\"color:#444444;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,255);\">Sudden, unexplained weight gain or loss.</span></li>\n<li style=\"color:#444444;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,255);\">Poor dental hygiene due to the teeth being exposed to stomach acid during purging sessions.</span></li>\n<li style=\"color:#444444;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,255);\">A disproportionate amount of importance placed on outward appearances.</span></li>\n<li style=\"color:#444444;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,255);\">A severely lowered immune system.</span></li>\n<li style=\"color:#444444;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,255);\">Feelings of malaise or\u00a0<a style=\"color:#0088cc;\" title=\"Depression\" href=\"http://www.advice4consumers.net/health/depression/\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,255);\">depression</span></a>.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h4 style=\"font-weight:bold;color:#2980b9 !important;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,255);\">Eating Disorder Treatment Options</span></h4>\n<p style=\"color:#444444;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,255);\">As these types of mental health disorder may have significantly different causal factors, there are several methods available to restore a healthy balance to one\u2019s life.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color:#444444;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,255);\">The first option is seeking traditional therapeutic counselling. This can be done on a face-to-face basis or in a group setting. Counsellors will provide tools and skills that can help patients cope with their fears, re-establish a positive body image, establish a healthy diet and realize when they may be slipping back into a negative habit. Sessions tend to be quite effective although they may take time to show results. Avoid mental health centres that seem overly expensive and yet come with few objective recommendations. Instead, perform an online search of any practitioners in the area and determine whether they have received positive reviews.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color:#444444;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,255);\">A second option is the administration of certain carefully monitored medications. Such forms can include tricyclic\u00a0<a style=\"color:#0088cc;\" title=\"Antidepressants\" href=\"http://www.advice4consumers.net/health/antidepressants/\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,255);\">antidepressants\u00a0</span></a>or other medications that can properly regulate certain chemicals in the brain that may be imbalanced. These can only be prescribed by a psychiatrist and the patient will concurrently see an eating disorder specialist.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color:#444444;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,255);\">Another popular option is to attend eating disorder groups such as Overeater\u2019s Anonymous. These groups offer a robust support system where individuals in similar situation can relate their experiences, gauge each others\u2019 progress and offer much-needed advice when necessary. Such groups are free to attend and are administered by a licensed therapist; he or she most likely having suffered from a similar ailment in the past.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color:#444444;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,255);\">If someone you know is suffering from an eating disorder, talk to the person suffering from the illness and explain that they need the help of a trained doctor who can provide the correct type of therapy to help them overcome their battle. Try to begin to have them understand that conditions such as food addiction or bulimia nervosa do not represent a weakness of character but rather a true medical condition. Finally and perhaps most importantly, it is essential that the sufferer is comfortable with the doctor they are seeing, as otherwise the help received may be ineffective and they will rebound into their old habits.</span></p>\n<h6 style=\"font-weight:bold;color:#2980b9 !important;\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;color:rgb(0,0,255);\">Three of the most effective eating disorder treatment techniques are:</span></h6>\n<ul style=\"color:#0f0f0f;\">\n<li style=\"color:#444444;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,128);\">Personalized counselling.</span></li>\n<li style=\"color:#444444;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,128);\">The administration of certain types of medication.</span></li>\n<li style=\"color:#444444;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,128);\">Group sessions.</span></li>\n<li style=\"color:#444444;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,128);\">Talk to the sufferer and support them through their treatment.</span></li>\n</ul>\n", "post_id": 2966, "location": false, "date": "04-27-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<div class=\"wpcom-reblog-snapshot\"> <div class=\"reblog-post\"><p class=\"reblog-from\"><img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/096ee2cc47f8d143b04dc3b397ea0c82?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />Originally posted on <a href=\"http://journeytoabettermeblog.wordpress.com/2014/04/27/the-health-benefits-of-strawberries\">Journey To A Better Me</a>:</p><div class=\"reblogged-content\">\n<p>Today I wanted to share with you the health benefits of strawberries. \u00a0Boy do I love me some strawberries. \u00a0They are another one of my favorite fruits and are great in a fruit salad or just by themselves.</p>\n\n<p>Below are some of the health benefits of strawberries.<a href=\"http://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/img_20140330_135239_803.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright wp-image-2431 size-medium\" src=\"http://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/img_20140330_135239_803.jpg?w=300&#038;h=190\" height=\"190\" width=\"300\" alt=\"IMG_20140330_135239_803\"></a> \u00a0I love the fact that not only are the fruits and vegetables I\u2019ve been covering good for you, but they taste good too.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to the website<a href=\"http://health.india.com/\" title=\"Health India\"> health.india.com</a> for the information below. \u00a0It is much appreciated as always. \u00a0Giving credit where credit is due.</p>\n\n<p>1. \u00a0S<span style=\"color:#333333;\">trawberries are packed with Vitamin C, which helps boost your immunity and protects you from infections.

(You can read the whole article here\u00a0:<a style=\"color:#cc4d22;\" href=\"https://shine.yahoo.com/healthy-living/does-hot-water-lemon-really-help-detox-142100872.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">https://shine.yahoo.com/healthy-living/does-hot-water-lemon-really-help-detox-142100872.html</span></a>.) In it, the author goes through, step by step, why lemon juice has been decided upon as our holy grail for health and weight loss. And while he doesn\u2019t necessarily disagree with everything being said about lemon, he does have a few issues with some of the terms being tossed around.<span id=\"more-356\"></span></strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>On the first two points, he says the literature could support the interpretation. Lemon is supposed to aid digestion \u2013 because it contains citric acid. Citric acid has been shown to boost the absorption of the active ingredient in most antacids. However, citric acid can also irritate some people, and it doesn\u2019t necessarily encourage optimal digestive flora (although some people argue it does). Vitamin C (aka citric acid) also has the effect of boosting mineral absorption \u2013 which is why it helps with digestion, because the active ingredient in most antacids is mineral-based (aluminum hydroxide).</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>So that\u2019s great, but don\u2019t forget that citric acid occurs in tons of fruits and vegetables. Lemons happen to have one of the higher concentrates, but other citrus fruit \u2013 like oranges, grapefruits, and limes \u2013 also have high levels of Vitamin C. Kale, spinach, and carrots also have quite a bit of ye olde C.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Okay, how about the final claim: Lemon detoxifies our systems. Welllll, here\u2019s where we run into a huge issue. What the eff do we mean by \u201cdetoxify?\u201d</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>In a strict sense, we mean a process of eliminating toxins from our bodies. That sounds really healthy, right? It sounds like something you want to do. Toxins are bad and getting rid of them is good.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>That\u2019s generally true, but nobody has ever actually defined toxins or noted which toxins lemon supposedly gets rid of. We tend to think of \u201cdetox\u201d as this sort of purifying process where we get rid of all kinds of \u201cnasty\u201d chemicals and \u201ctoxins\u201d that are doing huge damage to our bodies, building up and causing all kinds of health problems.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>If you want to use a very loose definition of toxin, though, caffeine is a toxin. In fact, so are most things we put into our bodies. Caffeine is a good example here, though: It\u2019s<em style=\"font-style:italic;\">relatively</em>\u00a0benign, in that it doesn\u2019t do a heck of a lot of damage and it\u2019s usually eliminated from our systems in short order anyway. You have to drink a lot of coffee to notice much long-term damage, although caffeine has been implicated in certain cancers and other diseases. (It also has been indicated in\u00a0<em style=\"font-style:italic;\">preventing</em>\u00a0certain diseases, so basically, nature is a crapshoot and you should just stick to the moderation manifesto \u2013 do what you want, but don\u2019t go crazy, eh?) And furthermore, the body eliminates this \u201ctoxin\u201d anyway \u2013 it\u2019s removed in our waste products.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>What about calcium? We normally think of this mineral as being incredibly important \u2013 our bodies use it to build bones and teeth, and it\u2019s important in preventing osteoporosis. But did you know too much calcium is harmful? If there\u2019s too much calcium in your system, you can get things like bone spurs \u2013 where the body just keeps building bone, \u2018cause it can, resulting in protrusions that are often very painful and have to be surgically removed. And calcium is also implicated in the formation of kidney stones. So is calcium a toxin that we need to get rid of? Sure \u2013 lemonade is one remedy for kidney stones, since the acid tends to help break apart the calcium that\u2019s causing the stones to form. So yes, calcium is a toxin, and yes, lemon juice will detoxify you \u2013 provided we\u2019re talking about removing calcium from the system or flushing the kidneys.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>But nobody knows that\u2019s what we\u2019re saying. We toss around these nebulous, ill-defined terms like \u201ctoxins\u201d or \u201cdetoxify\u201d and nobody actually knows what they mean. We just sort of toss them out there and we all get super-excited because, gosh, it\u00a0<em style=\"font-style:italic;\">sounds</em>\u00a0really good. Toxic is bad! We\u2019d better get it out. But do we even know what we\u2019re trying to get out?</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n", "post_id": 2973, "location": false, "date": "04-27-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<div class=\"wpcom-reblog-snapshot\"> <div class=\"reblog-post\"><p class=\"reblog-from\"><img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/2fc9cc7abfa4580bf3a8b8a59240c5e6?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />Originally posted on <a href=\"http://cherryblueberry.com/2014/04/27/5-easy-weight-loss-tips\">Cherry Blueberry</a>:</p><div class=\"reblogged-content\">\n<img class=\"alignleft size-large wp-image-422\" src=\"http://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/dsc_0344-cropped-e1398595127101.jpg?w=861&#038;h=1024\"   alt=\"Vesela Savova\">\n\nHello friends!\n\n\n<p>As summer is approaching we all want to look and feel better.

Here&#8217;s how to create a positive eating environment</strong></span></div>\n<p style=\"color:#009999;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Creating an environment where your kids can make healthy nutritional choices is one of the most important steps you can take to ensure the health of your child.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"color:#009999;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>By fostering a supportive environment, you and your family can develop a positive relationship with healthy food. You can lead them by your example.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"color:#009999;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Here are 10 tips for getting children to eat healthy food and form wise nutritional habits, offered by Melinda Sothern, PhD, co-author of\u00a0<i>Trim Kids\u00a0</i>and director of the childhood obesity prevention laboratory at Louisiana State University.</strong></span></p>\n<h3 style=\"font-weight:bold;color:#009999;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>1. Avoid placing restrictions on food.</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"color:#009999;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Restricting food increases the risk your child may develop eating disorders such as anorexia or bulimia later in life. It can also have a negative effect on growth and development. Instead of banning foods, talk about all the healthy, nutritional options there are &#8212; encouraging your family to chose fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean meats, and low-fat dairy, while avoiding heavily processed, low-quality junk foods.</strong></span></p>\n<h3 style=\"font-weight:bold;color:#009999;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>2. Keep healthy food at hand.</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"color:#009999;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Children will eat what&#8217;s available. Keep fruit in a bowl on the counter, not buried in the crisper section of your fridge. Remember, your child can only choose foods that you stock in the house. And have an apple for your own snack. &#8220;Your actions scream louder than anything you will ever tell them,&#8221; says Sothern.</strong></span></p>\n<h3 style=\"font-weight:bold;color:#009999;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>3. Don&#8217;t label foods as &#8220;good&#8221; or &#8220;bad.&#8221;</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"color:#009999;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Instead, tie foods to the things your child cares about, such as sports or doing well in school. Let your child know that lean protein such as turkey and calcium in dairy products give them strength for sports. The antioxidants in fruits and vegetables add luster to skin and hair. And eating a healthy breakfast can help them keep focus in class.</strong></span></p>\n<h3 style=\"font-weight:bold;color:#009999;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>4. Praise healthy choices.</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"color:#009999;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Give your children a proud smile and praise when they choose healthy foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, or low-fat dairy.</strong></span></p>\n<h3 style=\"font-weight:bold;color:#009999;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>5. Don&#8217;t nag about unhealthy choices.</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"color:#009999;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>When children choose fatty, fried, unhealthy foods, redirect them by suggesting a healthier option.</strong></span></p>\n<ul style=\"color:#009999;\">\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0 Instead of regular potato chips and dip, offer baked tortilla chips and salsa.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0 If your child wants candy, try dipping fresh strawberries in a little chocolate sauce. Too busy? Keep naturally sweet dried fruit at home for quick snacks.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0 Instead of buying French fries, try roasting cut up potatoes in the oven (tossed in just a bit of oil).</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 style=\"font-weight:bold;color:#009999;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>6. Never use food as a reward.</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"color:#009999;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>This could create weight problems in later life. Instead, reward your children with something physical and fun &#8212; perhaps a trip to the park or a quick game of catch.</strong></span></p>\n<h3 style=\"font-weight:bold;color:#009999;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>7. Sit down to family dinners at night.</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"color:#009999;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>If this isn&#8217;t a tradition in your home, make it one. Research shows that children who eat dinners at the table with their parents have better nutrition and are less likely to get in serious trouble as teenagers. Start with one night a week, and then work up to three or four, to gradually build the habit.</strong></span></p>\n<div class=\"subhead_fmt\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Want to raise food-smart kids? Here&#8217;s how to create a positive eating environment.</strong></span></div>\n<aside class=\"archive\">\n<p style=\"color:#000000;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>WebMD Feature Archive</strong></span></p>\n</aside>\n<h3 style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>8. Prepare plates in the kitchen.</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>You can put the right portion of each item on everyone&#8217;s dinner plate, instead of offering up a food buffet or serve-yourself style. This way your children will learn to recognize healthy portion sizes. If adjusting to healthier portion sizes means smaller portions for your family, help make the switch seem less shocking by using smaller plates.</strong></span></p>\n<h3 style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>9. Give the kids some control.</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Ask your children to take three bites of all the foods on their plate and give each one a grade, such as A, B, C, D, or F. When healthy foods &#8212; especially certain vegetables &#8212; get high marks, serve them more often. Offer the items your children don&#8217;t like less frequently. This lets your children participate in decision making. After all, dining is a family affair.</strong></span></p>\n<h3 style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>10. Consult your pediatrician.</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Always talk with your child&#8217;s doctor before putting your child on a weight loss diet, trying to help your child gain weight, or making any significant changes in the type of foods your child eats.

This is\u00a0not an allergic condition, but an inability to digest lactose (milk sugar) because the body produces low levels oflactase,\u00a0the enzyme responsible for digesting lactose. It can affect both children and adults, and the common symptoms are diarrhoea, bloating, discomfort. Lactose intolerance may occur temporarily following a bout of gastroenteritis, with diarrhoea being the main symptom. Lactose is present in cow\u2019s milk, goat\u2019s milk and sheep\u2019s milk in similar quantities As with all intolerances the only solution is avoidance of the offending food until one can once again tolerate it, which may be weeks, months or longer.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"color:#666666;text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>For some people there is a dose related response, that is one may be able to tolerate milk in tea, but a glass of milk would cause symptoms. There is a test available for the diagnosis of lactose intolerance, called a lactose challenge, and for small babies and children is especially advisable. \u00a0If there is no need to exclude foods from a diet then life is a great deal simpler.

If your diet is already restricted or you have a family history of osteoporosis (brittle bones) a dietitian should be consulted. Your GP can refer you to a state registered dietitian on the National Health Service. If there is no history of gastroenteritis causing your symptoms, then it may be necessary for milk to be permanently excluded from the diet, provided it is a well balanced diet this should not have any significant effects on your health.

The sad truth is that grandparents do not have an automatic right to contact with their grandchildren. However, family courts do recognise the invaluable role that grandparents have to play in their grandchildrens lives and it is very rare that the court would refuse a grandparent access to grandchildren unless there is evidence of abuse or violence.</strong></span></p>\n<div style=\"color:#222222;\">\n<h2 style=\"color:#2d2d2d;text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Can Grandparents Apply To The Courts For Access to Grandchildren?</strong></span></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Only people with parental responsibility, for example parents, step-parents or guardians can make an application for a Contact Order. Whilst grandparents rights are limited they can, however, apply for permission (leave) to apply for a Contact Order and the courts will consider the following:</strong></span></p>\n<ul style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>The applicant\u2019s connection with the child.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>The nature of the application for contact.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Whether the application might be potentially harmful to the child\u2019s well-being in any way.</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>If you are successful, you can apply for a Contact Order through the court to gain access to your grandchildren. If one, or both parents raise objections you are likely to have to attend a full hearing in which both parties can put forward their evidence. It is essential that you receive good legal advice at this stage because you will need to persuade the court that you have a meaningful and on-going relationship with your grandchildren, which significantly benefits their lives.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>The court will always consider all the child\u2019s circumstances and must only make an order where they consider it better for the child than making no order at all. For example, they might have to weigh up whether your continuing contact with the child might have a negative impact on the rest of the family relationships, again it is only in extreme circumstance that a court will refuse access to grandchildren. We have successfully helped many grandparents resolve disputes amicably and gain access to granchildren.</strong></span></p>\n<h2 style=\"color:#2d2d2d;text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>What Is A Contact Order?</strong></span></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>A Contact Order will stipulate the arrangements agreed upon including direct forms of communication such as face-to-face visiting rights; and in-direct forms such as letters, video, text, email and telephone calls etc.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.thefamilylawco.co.uk/i/uploads/gallery/Grandparents/iStock_000002665235XSmall.jpg\" alt=\"Grandchildren kissing granny\" />The order requires that the person with whom the child lives allows the child to stay or visit with the person named in the order, or for that person and the child to otherwise have contact with each other.</strong></span></p>\n<h2 style=\"color:#2d2d2d;text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Can A Contact Order Be Enforced?</strong></span></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>A Contact Order can be enforced, but we would advise you to take good legal advice at the outset to ensure that the Contact Order you have is successful, so there is no need to enforce.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Thankfully the majority of people obey Contact Orders, but some will refuse and although a Contact Order can be enforced, the courts are often reluctant to do so since the penalty would either be a fine (or rarely imprisonment), and the court&#8217;s are unwilling to deprive a child from his / her primary carer.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Taking good legal advice early on will ensure that you are taking all the steps you can to move your case forward.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>There are a number of orders available including Indirect contact (through letters, gifts, phone calls, e-mail, texts etc), direct contact (with your grandchild meeting or staying with you), and supervised contact (if there are concerns about a child\u2019s safety).</strong></span></p>\n<h2 style=\"color:#2d2d2d;text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Ways To Stay In Touch With Your Grandchildren</strong></span></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Whilst it is ideal to have face-to-face contact with your grandchildren, there are occasions where this is not possible.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>In this case, the court may grant \u2018Indirect Contact\u2019 where you can write to your grandchildren, send Christmas and birthday cards together with small presents.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>In addition to birthdays, it can be beneficial to choose specific dates to write to your grandchildren.

Why?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>It&#8217;s a common part of childhood, the trip to the shoe shop and your feet being measured. But according to new research conducted by Clarks, there are still four million children in shoes that don&#8217;t fit them.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Parents who squeeze their child&#8217;s feet into the wrong-sized shoes could be condemning them to a lifetime of problems. From blisters, pressure sores and ingrowing toe nails in the short-term, to feet deformities like hammer toe and knee and posture problems in the long-term. The list goes on.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>People need to take as much care of their children&#8217;s feet as they do with their teeth, say podiatry professionals. If that&#8217;s the case, why are so many children in shoes that don&#8217;t fit?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Neglect, budget constraints, convenience and fashion are all to blame, says Dr Gordon Watt, lecturer in podiatry at Glasgow Caledonian University.</strong></span></p>\n<div class=\"story-feature wide \" style=\"color:#505050;\">\n<h2 style=\"font-weight:bold;color:#505050;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>The answer</strong></span></h2>\n<ul style=\"color:#505050;\">\n<li style=\"color:#505050;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>People don&#8217;t realise the problems ill-fitting shoes can cause</strong></span></li>\n<li style=\"color:#505050;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>People opt for cheaper shoes</strong></span></li>\n<li style=\"color:#505050;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Fashion trends often aren&#8217;t good for feet</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p id=\"story_continues_2\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>&#8220;People think of feet as smelly,&#8221; he says. &#8220;They often just forget about them, when they should actually take much more of an interest.&#8221;</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Children&#8217;s feet tend to grow rapidly in the first four years of their life, but it can take up to 18 years for the foot&#8217;s bones, muscles and ligaments to harden into adult form. So teenage feet need to be looked after as well as those of smaller children.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>According to the research, one in 10 parents say their children have continued to wear shoes that are too small for them. Half admit to only buying new shoes when their children complain their feet are hurting.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Podiatry experts say many people neglect their children&#8217;s feet because they simply don&#8217;t understand the problems an ill-fitting pair of shoes can cause. Only 40% of parents interviewed as part of the research took into account whether the shoes on their offspring&#8217;s feet were well fitting and supportive.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong style=\"font-weight:bold;\">False economy</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Another issue is money. Two fifths of parents admitted to buying shoes that were too big so their children could grow into them over time, saving money. When it came to actually purchasing footwear, a quarter of parents said they based their decision on the cost.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>The rise of cheaper shoes, sold without expert advice and proper fitting in stores and supermarkets, has also had an impact. Not only do they cost less, but they are often more convenient to buy than taking a child to a proper shoe shop for a fitting.</strong></span></p>\n<div class=\"caption body-narrow-width\" style=\"color:#505050;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Fashion is often bad for feet</strong></span></div>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>But it&#8217;s a false economy in more ways than one, says Bob Hardy, a leading expert on shoe fitting and fellow of the Society of Shoe Fitters.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>&#8220;Not only are the health of their child&#8217;s feet at risk, cheaper shoes often fall apart and people end up going back two or three times for a new pair. They end up paying the same as they would have for well-made, properly-fitted shoes.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>&#8220;Also, these shoe often don&#8217;t come in half sizes or different widths, both of which are important if you want a shoe to fit properly.&#8221;</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Fashion trends also sway one in ten parents. This is a particular problem among older children and teenagers.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>&#8220;Often fashionable shoes offer very little support,&#8221; says Dr Watt.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Specialist training</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>&#8220;Take the current trend for ballet pumps among girls. They offer no support and are very flat. If you have an active child running around in them it could lead to Achilles [tendon] problems in the future.&#8221;</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>There are checks that parents can do at home to make sure their child&#8217;s shoe fits properly, says Mr Hardy.</strong></span></p>\n<div class=\"story-feature wide \" style=\"color:#505050;\">\n<h2 style=\"font-weight:bold;color:#505050;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>WHO, WHAT, WHY?</strong></span></h2>\n<div class=\"caption\" style=\"color:#505050;\"></div>\n</div>\n<p id=\"story_continues_3\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>There should be no more than a 14mm gap between the big toe and end of a shoe in a new pair. Anything less than 8mm and it&#8217;s time to visit the shoe shop and get another pair. When it comes to width, the shoe should be supporting the foot, not squeezing it.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>It is worth going to a shoe shop because proper shoe fitters will have undergone specialist training, either through their employer or with the Society of Shoe Fitters.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>What parents should also remember is there are variations in shoe sizing due to factors like the place they are made, says Mr Hardy. German shoes, for example, are wider than Italian.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Because of this a child&#8217;s foot should be measured every time they get new shoes and parents should not rely on the size printed inside the shoe, he says.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Finally, make sure both feet are measured, as one can be larger than the other.</strong></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "post_id": 3025, "location": false, "date": "05-13-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["books breakfast cars children climate cooking dessert FAMILY food frog allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners animals aviation books breakfast "], "text": "<p class=\"poem\" style=\"font-weight:normal;text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/new.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-3029\" src=\"https://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/new.jpg?w=253&#038;h=173\" alt=\"NEW\" width=\"253\" height=\"173\" /></a></p>\n<p class=\"poem\" style=\"font-weight:normal;text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>I bought a brand new pair of shoes.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>You simply have to see.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>They&#8217;re purple, pink, and pretty.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>They&#8217;re as lovely as can be.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>They&#8217;re topped with silver sparkles,</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>so they shimmer in the sun.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>They&#8217;re awesome when I&#8217;m walking</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>and they&#8217;re stunning when I run.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>The laces look like rainbows</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>and the backs have flashing lights.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>The sides are lined with lightning bolts.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>They&#8217;re such amazing sights.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>But now my friends avoid me</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>when they see me on the street.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Indeed, my shoes are pretty</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>but they smell like stinky feet.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:normal;text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>&#8211;Kenn Nesbitt</strong></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "post_id": 3028, "location": false, "date": "05-14-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["allaboutmanners animals aviation books breakfast cars children climate cooking dessert FAMILY food frog allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners "], "text": "<h2 style=\"text-align:center;\"></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/shoe1.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-3035\" src=\"https://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/shoe1.jpg?w=234&#038;h=164\" alt=\"shoe1\" width=\"234\" height=\"164\" /></a><br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Shoes are one of the key necessities of all human beings just like clothing.

Moreover, the purpose of wearing shoes also matter very much. For example, the requirements for sports shoe are much different than ordinary shoe. Similarly, fashion shoes are also different in terms of colors and style than common wearing shoes. Many people buy their shoes with their deep interest and spend much time in selection of design and color of shoes. If you also love with your shoes and want to say something good about your shoes, here are some funny poems about shoes.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>1.

These multiples possess a very special and unique bond. Most twins hold more than simply good friendship, rather, they begin to bond as life-long companions beginning before they are even introduced to the world. In most cases,\u00a0<a class=\"link interlink\" style=\"color:#8a8a8a;\" title=\"identical twins\" href=\"http://voices.yahoo.com/topic/15347/identical_twins.html\" rel=\"&amp;content_type=topic&amp;content_type_id=15347\"><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\">identical twins</span></a>\u00a0share a stronger bond than that of fraternal twins, primarily due to the fact that they share the same genes (&#8220;Facts &amp; Stats&#8221;). Obviously, twins are very similar simply by sight, but it is unimaginable the extent to which twins are identical in their thought patterns, pathological, psychological, and physical aspects.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>Many identical twins experience the same thought patterns because of their shared genes (&#8220;Facts &amp; Stats&#8221;). Ron and Roger Scarbrough scored so similarly on a test that their teacher failed them, convinced they were cheating (Jackson 26). Given another chance, they again made the same errors. When joining the air force, they had to take a test, and mysteriously answered the same questions wrong. When retested, they again made the same one error (Jackson 26).</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>Janie and Linda N. are identical twin sisters (Bowles-Reyer). Their thought patterns were proven to be very similar when they both sent their parents the same exact present thousands of miles apart from each other (Bowles-Reyer). Twins reared apart at birth and later brought back together reveal further proof of the similar thought patterns of identical twins. As this being the basis of Dr. Thomas J. Bouchard&#8217;s studies at the University of Minnesota, he has met twins who both store rubber bands on their wrists, sneeze in public for attention, and pairs who walk into the ocean backward (Jackson 35).</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>Identical twin brothers, Jim Lewis and Jim Springer, were reared apart when they were just weeks old (Wright 43). Both men thought their brother had died at birth, but thirty-nine years later, they were reunited (Jackson 35). Dr. Bouchard studied them and was shocked to find many more similarities in their thought patterns than expected (Bowles-Reyer). It was discovered that both brothers married twice: first to a woman named Linda and the second time to a woman named Betty, named their sons James Alan and James Allen, had a dog named Toy as a child, took family vacations to the same location without ever meeting, and both worked part-time as a sheriff&#8217;s deputy in Ohio (Segal 118). The &#8220;Jim twins&#8221; were just one of the many interesting sets of twins studied by Dr. Bouchard (Mystery of Twins).</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>Sharon Poset and Debbie Mehlman, identical twins reared apart as infants, were reunited at age forty-five (Jackson 36). Dr. Bouchard discovered that they both had one child, yellow colonial-style houses, had a husband born in December, set their watches five minutes ahead to avoid being late, wore sunglasses in the shade, and shared strong religious beliefs (Jackson 34).</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>The mysterious similarities in the thought patterns of identical twins are truly mind-boggling, especially the similarities of twins reared apart at birth, considering they have never lived together. Besides similar thoughts, many twins experience a unique pathological bond.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>Pathologically, twins share a bond unlike any other. Many twins experience ESP and the ability to share one another&#8217;s consciousness (Bowles-Reyer). This is known as the nonlocal or universal mind. A physicist named J.S. Bell developed Bell&#8217;s Theorem, a hypothesis explaining nonlocal mind. It said that when two subatomic particles come into contact with each other and are then separated, a change in one particle could cause a similar change in the other, instantly and to the same degree. In the 1960&#8242;s, to test this hypothesis, researchers pointed a light at one twin&#8217;s eye and found that the other twin&#8217;s brain-wave pattern changed in response. Besides tests, many people&#8217;s personal experiences have helped to prove Bell&#8217;s Theorem.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>A woman named Linda N. gave birth to two babies in her life (Bowles-Reyer). The first time, she was two thousand miles apart from her identical twin sister, Janie, and the second time, Linda was in Naples, Italy while Janie was in Oregon. Both times, Janie went into labor pains with her sister. Similarly, when Linda was in the navy, she had to have multiple surgeries that Janie had to be medicated for. Linda stated, &#8220;If I notify her in advance she can control or manage the pain&#8221;(Bowles-Reyer).</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>In Yosemite, Maureen C. came close to drowning, and soon after, received a letter from her identical twin sister in Japan asking her if something had happened to her (Bowles-Reyer ). Besides this incident, in 1978, Maureen&#8217;s sister was killed in a car accident, and from one-and-a-half hours away, Maureen reported feeling dizzy at the same time her sister had had the accident and had to lay on the floor to keep herself from falling. Maureen was no doubt feeling everything her sister was feeling. Just as Maureen C. was submitted to experiencing her own sister&#8217;s death, Raymond Brandt also had to undergo this pain (Mystery of Twins).</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>Raymond Brandt was working on top of a pole with conductors that were not energized, but he suddenly felt a jolt of electricity run through his body (Mystery of Twins). This occurred at the same time that his identical twin brother, Robert, was electrocuted just five miles away (Mystery of Twins).</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>There is a chilling truth behind the nonlocal mind that raises many eyebrows and generates numerous questions, but it is truly fascinating if looked at from the perspective of J.S. Bell and his theorem. While the nonlocal mind is an amazing bond between identical twins, for people like Raymond Brandt and Maureen C., it becomes an entrapment in their own nightmares, both having had to experience the loss of their own twin and best friend.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>The psychological bond of twins can be recognized in the way twins grieve for their lost co-twin. Dr. Nancy Segal, the director of the Twins studies Center has been studying twinless twins for more than fifteen years (Jackson 37). She has learned from other&#8217;s personal accounts how heartbreaking and dramatically life-changing it is when one twin dies, leaving the other behind (Segal 176). She noted that twins grieve more for the loss of their co-twin than for a parent, sibling, relative, or even their own child, because they were not only best friends who bonded from the day of conception, who only understood each other, but are also left with constant reminders, such as birthdays. &#8220;The lonesome crowd can be especially lonely because most twins have never felt alone. Perhaps it is this unique feature of twinship that distinguishes its loss so dramatically from other losses&#8221;(Segal 186). Raymond Brandt still continues to cope with his brother&#8217;s death that occured over fifty years ago (Jackson 37). He stated, &#8220;When Robert died so abruptly, I had to make my first decision on my own. I couldn&#8217;t share my deepest fears about going on without him&#8221;(Jackson 38). &#8220;Twins are always thinking &#8216;we&#8217; rather than &#8216;me&#8217;&#8221;(Jackson 38). There is so much truth in this statement by Robert Brandt. Most twins grow up together sharing their deepest secrets, confident their trust will not be failed, so when a twin is left to live alone, it is as if they are all alone in the world with no one to turn to. It is a traumatic and devastating change that leaves them having to learn how to survive all over again.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>Crystal Shaw lost her twin sister, Lynsey, in a car accident at age eleven and continues to suffer painful anguish and sorrow over her loss (Jackson 37). At first, Crystal found it difficult to sleep at night because she had slept in the same room as Lynsey her whole life. Starting high school alone was especially hard, coming home sick the first three days (Jackson 38). Although Crystal will cope with Lynsey&#8217;s death for rest of her life, she is learning to adjust to her &#8220;new&#8221; life by talking to others who are also experiencing the same pain (Jackson 38).</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>To live as a twinless twin is a very difficult adjustment to cope with, and just as Raymond Brandt put it, &#8220;Such emotional connection, especially between identical twins makes it difficult for single-birth persons to identify with their loss&#8221;(Mystery of Twins). Support groups can help ease the pain, but the pain is always there, along with the endless memories and reminders.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>Some twins also share a rare physical bond. There have been incidences in which identical twins have gotten hurt just hours or days apart, or have died on the same day (Scheinfeld 228). Megan and Caitlin Coleman broke the same bone in their arms less than a week apart from each other (Mercer). More amazingly, two twin sisters died at a mental hospital just moments apart from each other while in separate rooms (Scheinfeld 228). Eng and Chang Bunker, the original &#8220;Siamese&#8221; twins, connected only by a thick band of flesh at the base of their chest, died a mere three hours apart (Mystery of Twins). There has even been one case in which both twins of a pair took their lives at about the same time (Scheinfeld 230)!</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>The physical bond of twins is inconceivable. No one will ever be sure whether these particular cases were due to the mysterious bond of twins or if they were simply coincidences.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(255,0,0);\"><strong>Twin is an ancient German word meaning &#8220;two-together&#8221; (Facts &amp; Stats), which not only defines twin in the literal sense, but more importantly, captures the true essence of being a twin. It signifies &#8220;two-together&#8221; living as life-long companions sharing secrets and laughing about things only they can understand. Twins share a profound bond, mysterious and intriguing to others, but which is a way of life for twins, themselves. This bond is so strong that no outside influence can break it (Bowles-Reyer). Even for those twins who have lost their co-twin, this bond cannot be destroyed, because it does not physically exist on the outside, rather it exists only in one&#8217;s heart. In the words of Raymond Brandt, &#8220;Once born a twin, always a twin&#8221;(Jackson 38).</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n", "post_id": 3056, "location": false, "date": "05-23-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["allaboutmanners animals aviation books breakfast cars children climate cooking dessert FAMILY food frog allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners ", "cyberbullying"], "text": "<h1 class=\"title\" style=\"font-weight:bold;color:#1f1f1f;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><a href=\"http://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/bull.jpg\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-3060\" src=\"https://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/bull.jpg?w=291&#038;h=250\" alt=\"bull\" width=\"291\" height=\"250\" /></span></a></strong></span></h1>\n<div class=\"entry\" style=\"color:#1f1f1f;\">\n<p style=\"color:#1f1f1f;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><em>Guidance for parents and young people on cyberbullying, including advice for ending (or preventing) the cycle of aggression.

What people call \u201cbullying\u201d is sometimes an argument between two people. But if someone is repeatedly cruel to you, that\u2019s bullying and you mustn\u2019t blame yourself. No one deserves to be treated cruelly.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"color:#1f1f1f;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Don\u2019t respond or retaliate. Sometimes a reaction is exactly what aggressors are looking for because they think it gives them power over you, and you don\u2019t want to empower a bully. As for retaliating, getting back at a bully turns you into one \u2013 and can turn one mean act into a chain reaction. If you can, remove yourself from the situation. If you can\u2019t, sometimes humor disarms or distracts a person from bullying.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"color:#1f1f1f;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Save the evidence. The only good news about bullying online or on phones is that it can usually be captured, saved, and shown to someone who can help. You can save that evidence in case things escalate.

This is completely up to you \u2013 don\u2019t do it if you don\u2019t feel totally comfortable doing it, because you need to make your position completely clear that you will not stand for this treatment any more. You may need to practice beforehand with someone you trust, like a parent or good friend.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"color:#1f1f1f;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Reach out for help\u00a0\u2013\u00a0<i>especially\u00a0</i>if the behavior\u2019s really getting to you.

Most social media apps and services allow you to block the person. Whether the harassment\u2019s in an app, texting, comments or tagged photos, do yourself a favor and block the person. You can also report the problem to the service. That probably won\u2019t end it, but you don\u2019t need the harassment in your face, and you\u2019ll be less tempted to respond. If you\u2019re getting threats of physical harm, you should call your local police (with a parent or guardian\u2019s help) and consider reporting it to school authorities.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"color:#1f1f1f;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Protect your accounts. Don\u2019t share your passwords with anyone \u2013 even your closest friends, who may not be close forever \u2013 and password-protect your phone so no one can use it to impersonate you.

Just standing by can empower an aggressor and does nothing to help. The best thing you can do is try to stop the bullying by taking a stand against it. If you can\u2019t stop it, support the person being bullied. If the person\u2019s a friend, you can listen and see how to help. Consider together whether you should report the bullying. If you\u2019re not already friends, even a kind word can help reduce the pain. At the very least, help by not passing along a mean message and not giving positive attention to the person doing the bullying.</strong></span></p>\n<h3 style=\"font-weight:bold;color:#222222;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Additional advice for parents</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"color:#1f1f1f;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Know that you\u2019re lucky if your child asks for help. Most young people don\u2019t tell their parents about bullying online or offline. So if your child\u2019s losing sleep or doesn\u2019t want to go to school or seems agitated when on his or her computer or phone, ask why as calmly and open-heartedly as possible. Feel free to ask if it has anything to do with mean behavior or social issues. But even if it does, don\u2019t assume it\u2019s bullying. You won\u2019t know until you get the full story, starting with your child\u2019s perspective.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"color:#1f1f1f;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Work with your child. There are two reasons why you\u2019ll want to keep your child involved. Bullying and cyberbullying usually involve a loss of dignity or control over a social situation, and involving your child in finding solutions helps him or her regain that. The second reason is about context. Because the bullying is almost always related to school life and our kids understand the situation and context better than parents ever can, their perspective is key to getting to the bottom of the situation and working out a solution. You may need to have private conversations with others, but let your child know if you do, and report back. This is about your child\u2019s life, so your child needs to be part of the solution.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"color:#1f1f1f;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Respond thoughtfully, not fast. What parents don\u2019t always know is that they can make things worse for their kids if they act rashly. A lot of cyberbullying involves somebody getting marginalized (put down and excluded), which the bully thinks increases his or her power or status. If you respond publicly or if your child\u2019s peers find out about even a discreet meeting with school authorities, the marginalization can get worse, which is why any response needs to be well thought out.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"color:#1f1f1f;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>More than one perspective needed. Your child\u2019s account of what happened is likely completely sincere, but remember that one person\u2019s truth isn\u2019t necessarily everybody\u2019s. You\u2019ll need to get other perspectives and be open-minded about what they are. Sometimes kids let themselves get pulled into chain reactions, and often what we see online is only one side of or part of the story.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"color:#1f1f1f;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>What victims say helps most\u00a0is to be heard \u2013 really listened to \u2013 either by a friend or</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>an adult who cares. That\u2019s why, if your kids come to you for help, it\u2019s so important to respond thoughtfully and involve them. Just by being heard respectfully, a child is often well on the way to healing.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"color:#1f1f1f;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>The ultimate goal is restored self-respect\u00a0and greater resilience in your child. This, not getting someone punished, is the best focus for resolving the problem and helping your child heal. What your child needs most is to regain a sense of dignity. Sometimes that means standing up to the bully, sometimes not. Together, you and your child can figure out how to get there.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"color:#1f1f1f;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>One positive outcome\u00a0we don\u2019t often think about (or hear in the news) is resilience. We know the human race will never completely eradicate meanness or cruelty, and we also know that bullying is not, as heard in past generations, \u201cnormal\u201d or a rite of passage. We need to keep working to eradicate it. But when it does happen and we overcome it \u2013 our resilience grows. It\u2019s not something that can be \u201cdownloaded\u201d or taught. We grow it through exposure to challenges and figuring out how to deal with them. So sometimes it\u2019s important to give them space to do that and let them know we have their back.</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n", "post_id": 3059, "location": false, "date": "05-26-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["allaboutmanners animals aviation books breakfast cars children climate cooking dessert FAMILY food frog allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners "], "text": "<h2 style=\"font-weight:bold;color:#000000;\"><a href=\"http://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/bullshit.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-3064\" src=\"https://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/bullshit.jpg?w=150&#038;h=142\" alt=\"bullshit\" width=\"150\" height=\"142\" /></a></h2>\n<div class=\"clearfix post-container\" style=\"color:#000000;\">\n<div id=\"post_2268019\" class=\"post-body\" style=\"font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>I used to think, this internet I roamed, was oh so safe, of any hatred at all!

In fact, its the opposite! All you need to win a child over is simple and fun party food. Being creative can be easy. Kids taste with their eyes first. If the food doesn&#8217;t look appealing then good luck getting them to eat it. Try creative and decorative food. If it&#8217;s bright orange or looks like bugs they&#8217;ll probably eat it!</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Some other great kids party food tips:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>1) Keep the food familiar and simple. A party is not the time to try something new. Keep it familiar.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>2) Creative naming is always a great way to get kids to eat. Taste is not most important, fun is what kids want, even in food. Fun names are a great way to get them interested.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>3) Finger friendly food eliminates the need for utensils which helps to minimize accidents. Plus kids love to play with their food!</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>4) Make the food interesting. Fun shapes and colors are attractive to kids. Kids are more likely to eat when the food is appealing to their eye. Remember, appealing to\u00a0<i>THEIR</i>\u00a0eye is the key, not your eye.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Great Kids Party Food recipes to follow!</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Check back often, we&#8217;ll be updating this Kids Party Food page often!</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<hr />\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Hotdog Worms &#8211; (Excellent to use as a kids Halloween Party Food)</strong></span></p>\n<table width=\"160\" align=\"left\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/imageserve.babycenter.com/27/000/024/Qqn1M9z50Ozkth5grd5B6t27zfbUvU32_med.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"150\" /></strong></span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><i><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Ingredients:</span></i></strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Hotdogs</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Hotdog buns or hamburger buns</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Condiments &#8211; Mustard, ketchup, relish</strong></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><i><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Directions:</span></i></strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>1) Cut hotdogs into thin slices and score the edges (a couple cuts per slice).</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>2) Boil the hotdogs.

They expect everything to be handed to them. Kids want everything easy. Kids have no self-discipline. Kids think they are entitled to everything. Kids today don&#8217;t want to work for anything. Kids today have a terrible &#8216;work ethic&#8217;&#8230;&#8221; Why are there so many problems in our culture with entitlement, expectations and lack of work ethic?</strong></span><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Very simple. Adults misunderstand the concepts of reward and gifts. When adults and parents misunderstand these concepts they communicate misinformation to children. In order to properly discipline (regulate) anything, the concept of reward must be understood by the giver and the recipient. The differences amongst given things isn&#8217;t what is given, but for what purpose it is given and how it is received. Here is a description of purposes that give things to children: benefits(needs), gifts,prizes, awards and rewards.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><i>Benefits/needs</i>: At the most basic level of parenting, are\u00a0<i>benefits</i>.\u00a0<i>Benefits</i>\u00a0are things that children should reasonably expect from a parent: food, shelter, clothing, love, encouragement, nurturing and compassion.\u00a0<i>Benefits</i>\u00a0aren&#8217;t earned or lost. Benefits are things children cannot provide for themselves or by themselves.\u00a0<i>Benefits</i>\u00a0are every child&#8217;s birthrights. Naturally each family system interprets<i>benefits</i>\u00a0a little differently. And every family is more or less able to benefit their child. Surprisingly, however, most families are pretty unilateral about what they consider to be the\u00a0<i>benefits</i>\u00a0owed to children.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><i>Gifts</i>:\u00a0<i>Gifts</i>\u00a0are things that a parent does not owe to the child.\u00a0<i>Gifts</i>\u00a0are given out of love or generosity, not compulsion or need. A child does not earn gifts. There are no strings attached to gifts, either to the child or to the parent. Parents should not expect children to earn presents. And children should not expect parents to give presents. There is no issue of deserving or not deserving with a gift.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><i>Prizes</i>:\u00a0<i>Prizes</i>\u00a0are things that children win.\u00a0<i>Prizes</i>\u00a0are random and therefore impossible to earn. No control or choice affect the winning of a prize. Since no one has any idea who will win the\u00a0<i>prize</i>, there should be no expectations involved.\u00a0<i>Prizes</i>\u00a0are given in lottery style.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><i>Awards</i>:\u00a0<i>Awards</i>\u00a0are a hybrid of\u00a0<i>prize</i>\u00a0and\u00a0<i>reward</i>.\u00a0<i>Awards</i>\u00a0are earned, but they have a random nature also.\u00a0<i>Awards</i>\u00a0are earned based upon a competition amongst participants. The participant puts as much effort into his product, but success is tentative. Contests, sporting competitions, norm-referenced (high stakes) tests, merit-based pay and curved grading scales are examples of award systems. The\u00a0<i>award</i>\u00a0system is the only system in which there are winners and losers. In order for some to win, others must logically lose.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><i>Rewards</i>:\u00a0<i>rewards</i>\u00a0are defined as anything that must be earned.\u00a0<i>Rewards</i>\u00a0involve a cause and effect relationship, or an &#8216;if-then&#8217; situation.\u00a0<i>Rewards</i>\u00a0must be a direct one-to-one correspondence.\u00a0<i>Rewards</i>are a sort of bargain or transaction. To earn a\u00a0<i>reward</i>\u00a0something positive must be done, or something negative refrained from. The key difference between\u00a0<i>rewards</i>\u00a0and all other given things is that the child has complete control over whether she earns the\u00a0<i>reward</i>. It is completely her choice.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>It&#8217;s obvious from these definitions, that it is important that children understand why they are receiving something. Children need to know how to earn a reward or receive an award. If something is earned by contest, it&#8217;s important to understand if the contest is a lottery prize or an earned award. Gifts should be understood as gifts, not benefits or rewards. Because our culture has skewed these concepts, &#8216;kids today&#8217; reflect misunderstandings in their thinking. Kids today aren&#8217;t lazier or more selfish. Kids today don&#8217;t have a poor work ethic. Kids today are misinformed and have been confused by us adults. Getting these concepts straight as adults helps us discipline our children properly.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Look for my upcoming articles that explain more about the interaction of rewards, awards, prizes, gifts and benefits in parenting, education and child development.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>HOW DO WE COPE ?

I know theirs is a valid reason but sometimes we wish we could?ve been told earlier, so that it doesn?t come to us as a shock.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Mom has had her share of challenges and ups and downs. Ever since my father passed away 30 years ago, we?ve felt how she?s missed dad. She has devoted her life to rearing us the best way she could. Since my brothers and I got married, she has always been supportive even in the smallest things.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>And, of course, there were occasional disagreements that brought to light the generation gap.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>But these were also the times I have learned the most.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Creating the gap</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>This gap happens not only between us and our children, but also between us and our own parents. From birth, we have lived under their guidance and rules. They were the world to us. Then it happened?we grew up.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>When we step into another stage of our lives (whether it?s career, starting a family or going through a major change), we often feel that we are independent enough to make our own decisions.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>The fact that we and our parents are adults prods us to expect that they should be able to think like we do. And when conflicts arise, we evaluate them from our own perspective of how an adult should behave.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Imagine a shelf already filled with books. When new books start to arrive, and space has to be made for them on that shelf, what happens? Whether you remove the old books or retain your favorites, still, some books must go. Some of us may have unconsciously likened the old and less favorite books to our own parents.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Reasons for being</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>We sometimes take them for granted, without considering that at their age, they have worries too: health, memory gaps and even less mobility?there are a lot of things they can?t do anymore.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>They may look back on their lives, how they fared in their youth, maybe even feel some regret. In all this, whether they admit it or not, they turn to us for comfort.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>They may not be the decision-makers anymore, but our parents still wish to be heard and acknowledged. If they tend to be tactless and callous, it?s because they feel left out. Even in their infirmity, they hope they remain a vital presence in our lives.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Building bridges</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Come to think of it, aren?t these the same things we need? Some of us usually forget because we are focused on our spouse and children, responsibilities, financial obligations and other concerns. We take our parents for granted because now we have our own world, even if they had a hand in giving us that world to begin with. I don?t think we want this to happen to us when the time comes.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>It really doesn?t cost anything to tell our parents: ?Thank you?; ?I really appreciate this?; ?I love you, Mom.?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>It won?t cost you to make them feel you love them just by holding their hand while you cross the street, while you?re talking with them, giving them compliments, hugging them when you are happy or sad, looking at them lovingly while answering their questions, or even while arguing, not raising your voice and just calmly explaining your side.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Whatever happens, always listen first?hard to do because we always anticipate what they will say so that what comes out of our mouths is not pleasant to hear. If their suggestion is, indeed, better, let us accept it and thank them.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Let us be more patient and understanding when we evaluate a situation?why could he/she have said that? How will he/she respond if I answer back this or that way? Is there a need he/she is trying to fulfill? What would be the proper response to avoid misunderstanding?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>We can?t control how our parents think, but we can control how we respond. Then we learn.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>I admire those who have amazing relationship with their parents; whose relationship is based on trust, communication and unselfishness; those who are able to spend much time with each other and have the opportunity to bridge that gap.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>There are so many things I still want to do for my mom. I know many factors limit me, but I could start with this.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>My life?s bookshelf brims with books, some of which I haven?t even read but had planned to.

Almost everyone still enjoys being on the receiving end of polite treatment, but few seem to care to cultivate the behavior in themselves-and good manners have to be cultivated, they seldom grow naturally. Clearly there is a lot to be said in favor of practicing good manners, much to be gained by simple politeness, but it takes some real effort and motivation to incorporate good manners in our normal behavior. For Christians that motivation is simply expressed when Paul says that <i>&#8220;love is not rude&#8221;</i> (or &#8220;ill-mannered&#8221; or &#8220;unseemly,&#8221; 1 Cor. 13:5).</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Though it can be shown that good manners are of value to everyone and good for all of society, people cannot generally be expected to behave well for a vague or intangible reason. The easiest and perhaps most natural response to bad behavior is bad behavior. Even if we know that bad manners contribute to societal decay and an overall atmosphere of violence and intolerance few people think about such concepts in a moment of anger, frustration, or impatience. Many of the ways that we interact with strangers today seem to be almost designed to promote the attitudes that provoke bad manners (freeway driving, shopping lines, drive through service, telephone sales, etc.) In fact, in keeping with the general decline in the practice of good manners, there are multitudes of training programs today that actually encourage bad manners as a device for personal success under the banner of &#8220;assertiveness.&#8221;</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Some seem to think that the solution to the problems associated with bad manners in general is to be found in fear (&#8220;an armed society is a polite society&#8221;) or else in regimentation and mandated conformity (dress codes, regulations). These are unlikely solutions though. They do not address the basic problem of (not) respecting and caring for other people. While either fear or rules can provoke an attitude, neither can provide effective motivation for a sustained good attitude. The attitude that produces good manners is a product of training and motivation. People will not behave well unless they 1) want to behave well and 2) know how to. &#8220;Love is not rude.&#8221; People (you and I) have to learn-again-to value people. Christian leaders are directed to teach people <i>&#8220;to speak evil of no one, to avoid quarreling, to be gentle, and to show every courtesy to everyone&#8221;</i> (Titus 3:2 NRSV). The gospel of God\u2019s love supplies the motive to want to behave well and the church is to be a training ground for good manners, teaching believers how to behave well. The Christian way of life is directly based on values that demand good manners, respectful and polite treatment of other people-thoughtfulness, even toward anonymous strangers. Wherever society\u2019s manners may go, the Christian mandate is to behave well among the misbehaving. Good deeds truly begin with good manners. Jesus summarized the concept by saying, <i>&#8220;Treat others as you would like to be treated.&#8221;</i> (Matthew 7:12)</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Where Have All The (Good) Manners Gone?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>TELL US WHAT YOU THINK. \u00a0MAKE A \u00a0COMMENT.TELL US WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT MANNERS IN TODAYS SOCIETY.</strong></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "post_id": 3122, "location": false, "date": "07-27-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["allaboutmanners animals aviation books breakfast cars children climate cooking dessert FAMILY food frog allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners ", "good manners"], "text": "<div class=\"poet-bar\">\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"https://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/manners-22222222222222.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-3127\" src=\"https://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/manners-22222222222222.jpg?w=215&#038;h=280\" alt=\"MANNERS 22222222222222\" width=\"215\" height=\"280\" /></a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"fl w-660\">\n<div class=\"poem-detail\">\n<div id=\"solSiirMetinDV\">\n<div>\n<div class=\"KonaBody\" style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>It is good to have manners </strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>And I&#8217;am referring to good ones</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>It&#8217;s great to say &#8216;Thank you&#8217;</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>When you get some from someone</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Good manners you can always</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Cultivate them in your talk</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>You can learn them all</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>In your life as you walk</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>This wonderful process should</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Begin when the kids are small</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Parents should teach all</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Their children good manners</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>These days we don&#8217;t meet</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Many children with good manners you see</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Most of them act rude and that&#8217;s a shame</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>And that goes for teens and adults too </strong></span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"poet\" style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.poemhunter.com/dorian-petersen-potter/poems/\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Dorian Petersen Potter</span></a></strong></span></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n", "post_id": 3126, "location": false, "date": "07-27-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["s allaboutmanners animals aviation books breakfast cars children climate cooking dessert FAMILY food frog allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanner", "children", "marriage family therapist"], "text": "<div class=\"bodyHeader bodyHeaderArticle\">\n<div id=\"HeaderHolder\" class=\"left\">\n<div class=\"left titleBreadCrumbs\">\n<div id=\"AssociatedContent0\" class=\"AssociatedContent module\">\n<div class=\"inner\">\n<div class=\"hd\">\n<h2 style=\"text-align:center;\"></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"https://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/go.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-3132\" src=\"https://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/go.jpg?w=263&#038;h=395\" alt=\"GO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\" width=\"263\" height=\"395\" /></a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bd\" style=\"text-align:center;\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"HeaderTitle\" style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<div id=\"Title\" class=\"left\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<h1><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><span class=\"articleTitle\">Should You Stay Together for the Kids?</span></strong></span></h1>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"right adHolder\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"main mainArticle\">\n<div id=\"article\" class=\"article\">\n<div id=\"ArticleWell\" class=\"module structured articleBody moduleHeader2 marginClearBottom\">\n<div class=\"inner\">\n<div class=\"bd\">\n<div class=\"line pageBreak\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<div id=\"inject4-0\" style=\"text-align:center;\"></div>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>You&#8217;re going through a difficult time in your marriage. You may have even tried relationship counseling but it doesn&#8217;t look like things will work out with your spouse. The question is: Should you stay together for the kids&#8217; sake? Many experts believe you should.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>&#8220;In my opinion,&#8221; says Dennis Neder, an ordained minister and author of <em>Being a Man in a Woman&#8217;s World</em>(Remington Publications, 2000), &#8220;the highest form of selfishness is to breed. After all, children don&#8217;t ask to be born. Parents choose to create little carbon copies of themselves. Thus, I believe that parents should stay together for the sake of the children.&#8221;</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Laurie Moore, Ph.D., author of <em>Creative Intimacy: A Practical Guide to Better Relationships</em> (North Atlantic Books, 2001) and<em>Choosing a Life Mate Wisely</em>, strongly agrees. Moore, a psychotherapist and licensed marriage family therapist, also believes that couples should work out what she calls &#8220;practical lifestyle compatibility&#8221; issues before they have children.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>That means, says Dr. Neder, that &#8220;parents need to know what they believe and stand for. This includes beliefs about religion, government and politics, family and work life.&#8221; They also should be fiscally and emotionally mature enough to support a family and be committed to raising that family. The trick, according to Dr. Neder, is proper planning and perspective.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>&#8220;If couples would decide that they will raise their children as their primary responsibility, they would come to only one conclusion: staying together and agreeing to put the needs of their children before their own.&#8221;</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>If a couple can&#8217;t get along \u2014 even for the sake of the family \u2014 they should, at the very least, go out of their way to try and avoid confrontation, says Dr. Neder. While this is difficult for most people, he adds that children deserve this from their parents.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Repair Your Marriage With Baby Steps</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>When children are involved, try taking baby steps to keep the family together. Michele Weiner Davis, Ph.D., author of <em>The Divorce Remedy: The Proven 7-Step Program for Saving Your Marriage</em> (Simon &amp; Schuster, 2001), teaches people how to set new goals in a marriage. She says that people can change their relationships, even without their partner&#8217;s cooperation. Here&#8217;s how:</strong></span></p>\n<ul style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Start by writing down three things you hope to change in your marriage. Writing, says Weiner Davis, starts the action process because you get &#8220;out of your head.&#8221; Written down, your wishes appear more real. They also offer a baseline to which you can refer in the days to come.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Focus on what you want in your marriage \u2014 not what&#8217;s missing. When you zero in on complaints you perpetuate problems, rather than solve them.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Translate your complaints into goals. Once you do that, you can come up with steps that you or your spouse can take to improve things.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Take it one step at a time. It&#8217;s natural to want to speed through the repair process. But change is a gradual process. You don&#8217;t go from being miserable to being intensely in love again overnight. Be happy with small improvements \u2014 and try to be positive.</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>What if All Else Fails?</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Of course, it&#8217;s not a perfect world \u2014 not everyone can work out relationship differences. So, if children are suffering, Dr. Moore says it probably makes sense to split up.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>In such cases, parents must come to an understanding over the raising of the children, says Dr. Neder. Both parents should spend time with the children, regardless of who has custody. He also says that it&#8217;s important for men and women who seriously date a divorced parent to consult with that child&#8217;s mother or father to discuss beliefs and expectations about child rearing. The goal, of course, is to minimize the emotional trauma that divorce can bring into a child&#8217;s life. While divorced parents may no longer enjoy life as a family, they still can enjoy the pleasure of watching their child grow \u2014 together.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span

For instance, a person with Asperger\u2019s may engage in long-winded, one-sided conversations without noticing or caring about the listener\u2019s interest. They also often lack usual nonverbal communication skills, such as engaging in eye contact with others they\u2019re talking to, or failing to react and empathize with other people\u2019s stories and conversation. This may make them seem insensitive, although that is rarely the case. They may have a hard time \u201creading\u201d other people or understanding humor.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Adults, too, may have Asperger\u2019s, as often the disorder is not properly diagnosed in childhood. Asperger\u2019s is considered the mildest, least severe form of <a style=\"color:#ff0000;\" href=\"http://psychcentral.com/disorders/sx65.htm\">autism</a>. The following five criteria primarily characterize Asperger\u2019s Disorder.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>1. A significant, ongoing impairment in social interactions with others, as demonstrated by at least two of the following symptoms:</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Significant difficulty in the use of multiple nonverbal behaviors such as the lack of eye contact, few facial expressions, awkward or clumsy body postures and gestures</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Failure to develop friendships with other children of the same age</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Lack of spontaneous seeking to share enjoyment, interests, or achievements with other people (e.g., by a lack of showing, bringing, or pointing out objects of interest to other people)</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Failure to express appropriate and corresponding social or emotional reactions, such as when conversing or playing with others. For example, a child who shows little or no reaction, feelings or empathy to another child talking with them.</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>2. Restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, and activities, as shown by at least one of the following symptoms:</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>A significant and encompassing preoccupation or obsession with one or two restricted topics, that is abnormal either in intensity, subject or focus (such as baseball statistics or the weather)</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Seemingly inflexible adherence to specific routines or rituals that serve little purpose</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Repetitive motor mannerisms. For example, hand or finger flapping or twisting, or complex whole-body movements.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>A persistent preoccupation with parts of objects</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>3. The set of symptoms causes <em>significant impairment</em> in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>4. There is no significant general delay in language (e.g., single words used by age 2, communicative phrases used by age 3).</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>5. There is no significant delay in cognitive development (such as reading or math skills) or in the development of age-appropriate self-help skills, behavior, and curiosity about the environment in childhood.</strong></span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Early Signs of Asperger\u2019s Disorder</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>It\u2019s important to note that a person with Asperger\u2019s disorder has no general delay in language acquisition, cognitive development and adaptive behavior (other than in social interaction). This contrasts with typical developmental accounts of <a style=\"color:#ff0000;\" title=\"autistic children\" href=\"http://psychcentral.com/news/2010/02/26/autistic-children-benefit-from-sensitive-moms/11735.html\">autistic children</a> who show marked deficits and deviance in these areas prior to age 3.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Other common descriptions of the early development of individuals with Asperger\u2019s include certain characteristics that may be helpful in identifying it earlier on.

Especially in the early stages of the pregnancy, emotions are high. This is a life-changing situation for your daughter, for your family and for the father of her baby. \u201cRegardless of the complicated emotions that will most certainly arise during the pregnancy and once the baby is born, teens need parental support during this time,\u201d says <a style=\"color:#ff0000;\" href=\"http://practicalkatie.com/about/\" target=\"_blank\">Katie Hurley, LCSW</a>. \u201cWithout parental support, they are less likely to receive adequate prenatal care and maintain a healthy pregnancy diet.\u201d It may be difficult for parents to step up and be supportive when they are upset, but this is crucial for your daughter and her baby. \u201cTeen pregnancy is scary, isolating and can increase the risk for depression,\u201d adds Hurley.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><a style=\"color:#ff0000;\" href=\"http://drjohnduffy.com/dr-john-duffy/\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. John Duffy</a> has worked with many pregnant teens and their families. \u201cI&#8217;ve found a few truths through these experiences,\u201c he shares. \u201cPregnant teenage girls do not need lectures about \u2018carelessness\u2019, \u2018stupidity\u2019 or \u2018disregard for family rules or values.\u2018 I have witnessed a lot of this type of shaming from parents, and it makes things worse.\u201c</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Making your daughter feel the shame of her pregnancy\u00a0\u2014 rather than dealing with the situation\u00a0\u2014 does nothing to help her. What does help is to model good regulation on your emotions. \u201cThis is not to say that parents are not allowed their own feelings or disappointments,\u201d adds Duffy, \u201cbut the bulk of the discussions should be warm, supportive and progressive in nature.

If parents work together with their teens to help plan for the baby, establish childcare and routines, and provide social support, those statistics can change,\u201d adds Hurley.</strong></span></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>A teen\u2019s perspective</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>SheKnows writer <a style=\"color:#ff0000;\" href=\"http://www.sheknows.com/authors/jessica-watson/articles\">Jessica Watson</a> remembers her experience as a teen. \u201cWhen I found myself pregnant at the age of 16, my parents were understandably very disappointed.

emotionally, new research suggests.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Kindergarteners whose parents fought with each other frequently and harshly were more likely to grow into emotionally insecure older children who struggled with depression, anxiety and behavior issues by 7th grade, the study authors found.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>And yet, the researchers said, not all conflict was troublesome to children. If parents refrained from harshly criticizing one other, stonewalling one another or being violent with one another, and instead managed to work out their problems in a constructive way, children weren&#8217;t terribly bothered by the conflicts.</strong></span></p>\n<div id=\"ndn-video-player-2\" class=\"ndn_embed ndn_embedContainer ndn-widget-embed-2 ndn_embedding ndn-widget-embed-5\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></div>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>The key to keeping kids well-adjusted isn&#8217;t having a perfect, conflict-free marriage, the study authors said. It&#8217;s in being able to control emotions enough to fight fair, and resolve conflicts in a way that doesn&#8217;t threaten the stability of the family, they explained.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>&#8220;Problems occur every day. But if parents problem solve and try to work it out, if they come up with a resolution or work toward it, if the parents show positive emotion when they are in the middle of fighting, if they say nice things to each other or are affectionate, kids see all these things as very positive, and it changes how kids see the conflict,&#8221; said study author E. Mark Cummings, a professor of psychology at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Ind.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>The study, published in the journal <i>Child Development</i>, included 235 middle-class families (average family income between $40,000 and $60,000) from the Midwest and Northeast United States.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>When the children were in kindergarten, parents were asked about their level of marital conflict. Parents were also asked to discuss a potentially contentious topic, such as finances or parenting, while researchers rated how critical they were of their spouse.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>The children were then followed-up with seven years later, when they were in 7th grade. During that time, 36 couples separated or divorced, and two fathers died. Kids and their parents were again asked about a host of issues around behavior and emotional health.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>According to the findings, kids whose parents fought the most when the child was in kindergarten felt less emotionally secure, or felt less safe and protected. Emotional insecurity included things such as whether the kids were upset or acted out such as through hitting or aggression during the conflict, or if the kids reported they felt distressed by their parents&#8217; fights, Cummings said.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Kids who were less emotionally secure had more mental health issues such as symptoms of depression and anxiety, as well as behavioral problems.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Studies dating back to the 1920s have found that marital conflict can impact kids, Cummings said. This research tried to get at what aspects of conflict are the most damaging.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>&#8220;Conflict affects children by affecting their sense of emotional security about the family,&#8221; he said. &#8220;A child has a sense of security or well-being, and if they don&#8217;t have that they feel distressed emotionally, are more prone to aggression and hostility.&#8221;</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Parents face all sorts of stress, and fighting is normal, Cummings said. But parents need to keep in mind that their children are watching and listening.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>&#8220;Conflict is part of life. If you don&#8217;t always agree with your spouse, it&#8217;s fine, as long as you can work it out constructively,&#8221; Cummings said. &#8220;A lot of people don&#8217;t realize how much kids are affected by the relationship between the parents, not just the relationship of the parents to the kids. Kids&#8217; feelings about themselves and their family have to do with how the parents relate to each other as well as to the child.&#8221;</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>While the study uncovered an association between interparental conflict and emotional security in children, it did not prove a cause-and-effect relationship.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Dr. Andrew Adesman, chief of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at the Steven and Alexandra Cohen Children&#8217;s Medical Center of New York in New Hyde Park, said it&#8217;s not surprising that conflict between parents isn&#8217;t good for children&#8217;s emotional health.</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n<div id=\"zedoContainer\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></div>\n", "post_id": 3238, "location": false, "date": "09-27-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["allaboutmanners animals aviation books breakfast cars children climate cooking dessert FAMILY food frog allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners ", "front teeth"], "text": "<h2 class=\"posttitle icon\"><a href=\"https://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/teeth.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-3253\" src=\"https://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/teeth.jpg?w=246&#038;h=195\" alt=\"TEETH\" width=\"246\" height=\"195\" /></a></h2>\n<div class=\"content\">\n<div id=\"post_message_9923987\">\n<blockquote class=\"postcontent restore\"><p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>My sons teeth are awful he has cavities in all his front 4 teeth as far as I can see his bottom ones are fine but my view of the rest at the top is not good i&#8217;m devastated.

Such families should consider three key issues as they plan for remarriage:</strong></span></p>\n<ul style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Financial and living arrangements.\u00a0Adults should agree on where they will live and how they will share their money. Most often partners embarking on a second marriage report that moving into a new home, rather than one of the partner&#8217;s prior residences, is advantageous because the new environment becomes &#8220;their home.&#8221; Couples also should decide whether they want to keep their money separate or share it. Couples who have used the &#8220;one-pot&#8221; method generally reported higher family satisfaction than those who kept their money separate. </strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Resolving feelings and concerns about the previous marriage.\u00a0Remarriage may resurrect old, unresolved anger and hurts from the previous marriage, for adults and children. For example, hearing that her parent is getting remarried, a child is forced to give up hope that the custodial parents will reconcile. Or a woman may exacerbate a stormy relationship with her ex-husband, after learning of his plans to remarry, because she feels hurt or angry. </strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Anticipating parenting changes and decisions.\u00a0<em>C</em>ouples should discuss the role the stepparent will play in raising their new spouse&#8217;s children, as well as changes in household rules that may have to be made. Even if the couple lived together before marriage, the children are likely to respond to the stepparent differently after remarriage because the stepparent has now assumed an official parental role.</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Marriage quality</strong></span></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>While newlywed couples without children usually use the first months of marriage to build on their relationship, couples with children are often more consumed with the demands of their kids.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Young children, for example, may feel a sense of abandonment or competition as their parent devotes more time and energy to the new spouse. Adolescents are at a developmental stage where they are more sensitive to expressions of affection and sexuality, and may be disturbed by an active romance in their family.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Couples should make priority time for each other, by either making regular dates or taking trips without the children.</strong></span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Parenting in stepfamilies</strong></span></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>The most difficult aspect of stepfamily life is parenting. Forming a stepfamily with young children may be easier than forming one with adolescent children due to the differing developmental stages.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Adolescents, however, would rather separate from the family as they form their own identities.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Recent research suggests that younger adolescents (age 10-14) may have the most difficult time adjusting to a stepfamily. Older adolescents (age 15 and older) need less parenting and may have less investment in stepfamily life, while younger children (under age 10) are usually more accepting of a new adult in the family, particularly when the adult is a positive influence. Young adolescents, who are forming their own identities tend to be a bit more difficult to deal with.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Stepparents should at first establish a relationship with the children that is more akin to a friend or &#8220;camp counselor,&#8221; rather than a disciplinarian. Couples can also agree that the custodial parent remain primarily responsible for control and discipline of the children until the stepparent and children develop a solid bond.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Until stepparents can take on more parenting responsibilities, they can simply monitor the children&#8217;s behavior and activities and keep their spouses informed.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Families might want to develop a list of household rules. These may include, for example, &#8220;We agree to respect each family member&#8221; or &#8220;Every family member agrees to clean up after him or herself.&#8221;</strong></span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Stepparent-child relations</strong></span></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>While new stepparents may want to jump right in and to establish a close relationship with stepchildren, they should consider the child&#8217;s emotional status and gender first.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Both boys and girls in stepfamilies have reported that they prefer verbal affection, such as praises or compliments, rather than physical closeness, such as hugs and kisses. Girls especially say they&#8217;re uncomfortable with physical shows of affection from their stepfather. Overall, boys appear to accept a stepfather more quickly than girls.</strong></span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Nonresidential parent issues</strong></span></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>After a divorce, children usually adjust better to their new lives when the parent who has moved out visits consistently and has maintained a good relationship with them.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>But once parents remarry, they often decrease or maintain low levels of contact with their children. Fathers appear to be the worst perpetrators: On average, dads drop their visits to their children by half within the first year of remarriage.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>The less a parent visits, the more a child is likely to feel abandoned. Parents should reconnect by developing special activities that involve only the children and parent.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Parents shouldn&#8217;t speak against their ex-spouses in front of the child because it undermines the child&#8217;s self-esteem and may even put the child in a position of defending a parent.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Under the best conditions, it may take two to four years for a new stepfamily to adjust to living together. And seeing a psychologist can help the process can go more smoothly.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>HOW DID IT WORKOUT FOR YOU TELL US YOUR

Someone died from a fire every 169 minutes in 2014. Countless others suffered burns in the home. Many of these injuries and deaths might have been prevented with a working smoke alarm or some simple home safety tips. With a little thought and preparation, you can protect yourself and the ones you love. Here&#8217;s how.</strong></span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong>Preventing Burns While Cooking</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>The kitchen is the heart of the home, and it\u2019s not surprising that most accidental burns occur there. Fortunately, many of these burns can be prevented. Here are a few tips to help you make your kitchen a safer place.\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Stay in the kitchen while food is cooking.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Turn pot handles toward the back or center of the stove.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Keep items such as dish towels, plastic bags, and long sleeves away from the heating surface.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Never cook while holding a child or pet.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Keep small children and pets away from the front of the oven or stove.</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong>First Aid for Kitchen Burns</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>If despite your best efforts, you or a family member suffers a burn in the kitchen, follow these first aid tips:</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Run cool water over the burned area, soak it in cool water (not ice water), or cover it with a clean, cold, wet towel.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Cover the burn with a sterile bandage or a clean cloth.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Protect the burn from pressure and friction.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Use over-the-counter medications such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen for pain.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Do not apply butter, ice, fluffy cotton dressing, adhesive bandages, cream, oil spray, or any household remedy to a burn.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>If a burn appears to be severe or you develop signs of infection, call your doctor.</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong>Preventing Scalding Burns</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Of the many types of burns that can happen in your home, scalds may be the most unexpected. Thousands of people are injured each year by hot liquids and many of them are young children. Children have thinner skin than adults and are more likely to receive severe burns from hot liquid. Simple precautions can protect you and your family from scalding burns</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Set your hot water heater to 120 degrees.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Always test bath water before placing a child in the tub.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Never leave a child unattended in the bathtub.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Turn pot handles toward the back or center of the stove so children cannot tip pots over.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Never warm baby bottles in the microwave; they may heat unevenly and can burn your baby\u2019s mouth.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Use mugs or coffee cups with lids when you are around children.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Keep hot liquids like soup, coffee, or tea away from the edge of counters and tables.</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong>First Aid for Scalding Burns</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>If you or a family member suffers a scalding burn, take the following steps to start healing:</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Remove any clothing that is wet from the hot liquid.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Slowly cool the injury under running tap water for 30 minutes.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Do not apply ice, because it may stop important blood flow to the damaged skin.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Do not apply butter or salves to scald injuries.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong>\u00a0A COMMENT OR GIVE US YOUR \u00a0ADVICE</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n", "post_id": 3277, "location": false, "date": "10-23-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["allaboutmanners animals aviation books breakfast cars children climate cooking dessert FAMILY food frog allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners ", "National Fire Protection Association", "Cooking fires"], "text": "<header>\n<div id=\"float_tracker\" class=\"bN\">\n<section class=\"chicklets\">&nbsp;</p>\n</section>\n</div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><a href=\"https://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/fcs_kitchensafe_2.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3281\" src=\"https://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/fcs_kitchensafe_2.jpg?w=269&#038;h=415\" alt=\"fcs_kitchensafe_2\" width=\"269\" height=\"415\" /></a></strong></span></div>\n</header>\n<div class=\"float_right padding_left_10\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></div>\n<div id=\"mainentrycontent\" class=\"content\">\n<div class=\"float_left\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></div>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>A friend of mine was at home one evening with her three sons, ages 8, 6 and 1, and her mother. Her husband was away on a business trip. A fire started in the microwave in the kitchen and quickly spread to other rooms. She told her 8-year-old to grab the baby and get outside. Then she got her 6-year-old and her mother out and called 911 from her cellphone. In that moment, she realized how lucky they were: Their home was badly damaged, but her family was safe.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>In my 10 years at the National Fire Protection Association, I&#8217;ve heard many tragic stories about home fires. But I&#8217;d never personally known anyone who had experienced one until it happened to my friend. And it&#8217;s because of experiences like hers &#8212; and those of other families who were not so lucky &#8212; that the theme of this year&#8217;s Fire Prevention Week, taking place October 6-12, is &#8220;Prevent Kitchen Fires.&#8221;</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Our mission this week is to spread the word about how dangerous <a style=\"color:#ff0000;\" href=\"http://www.nfpa.org/~/media/files/research/fact%20sheets/cookingfactsheet.ashx\" target=\"_hplink\">kitchen fires</a> can be &#8212; and provide safety tips that can prevent them. Did you know that &#8230;</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>1. More fires start in the kitchen than in any other place in the home. Two of every five home fires start there.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>2. Cooking fires are common &#8212; and deadly. On average, they cause 44 percent of home fires, 15 percent of home fire deaths and 38 percent of home fire injuries each year.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>3. Multitasking while cooking is not a good idea. Unattended cooking is the leading cause of cooking fires, responsible for one-third of them.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>4. Frying is the #1 activity associated with cooking fires. Cooking oil or grease can easily catch fire if it gets too hot &#8212; and because frying is typically done in an open pan, a fire can spread easily once it starts..</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>5. The most common equipment involved in home cooking fires? Ranges or cooktops, which accounted for 58 percent of fires. Ovens accounted for 16 percent.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>6. An electric range is more dangerous than a gas range. That&#8217;s because, with an electric range, it may be less obvious that a burner is on &#8212; and because burners on electric ranges stay hot for a period of time even when turned off.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>7. Microwave ovens are more dangerous than you think. They&#8217;re one of the leading home products associated with scald burn injuries, accounting for 44 percent of the microwave injuries seen in emergency rooms in 2011.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>8. In the kitchen, it usually isn&#8217;t fires that burn young kids. More often, it&#8217;s contact with a hot stove or pans or a scald from hot cooking liquids or steam. In fact, children under age 5 accounted for 55 percent of tableware scalds, 42 percent of contact burns from ranges or ovens, and 34 percent of microwave scalds in 2011.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>9. What you wear while cooking makes a difference. Though loose clothing was the item first ignited in only 1 percent of home cooking fires, these incidents accounted for 16 percent of cooking fire deaths.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>10. Taking matters into your own hands can make matters worse. Three out of five people who were injured during cooking fires were injured while trying to fight the fire themselves. </strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Fortunately, there are steps you can take to keep your family safe.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>1. Cook only when you&#8217;re alert &#8212; not when you&#8217;re exhausted, not when you&#8217;ve been drinking. </strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>2. Keep an eye on what you fry. If you have to step away from the stove, turn it off.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>3. Keep things that can catch fire &#8212; such as dish towels, potholders and paper towels &#8212; away from the stove. And avoid cooking in your bathrobe &#8212; the loose sleeves can catch fire easily.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>4. Keep hot things away from the edges of tables and counters. </strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>5. Open microwaved food slowly, and keep the food away from your face.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>6. Have a &#8220;kid-free&#8221; zone of at least 3 feet around the stove and anything hot &#8212; and never hold your child while you&#8217;re cooking or carrying something hot.</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>7. Teach kids to stay away from the stove and hot foods. </strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>8. Keep pets off cooking surfaces. </strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>9. Install smoke alarms in the kitchen, outside each sleeping area, inside each bedroom, and on every level of your home (including the basement).</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>10. If you have a fire, just get outside, stay outside and call the fire department.</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n", "post_id": 3280, "location": false, "date": "10-23-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<div class=\"wpcom-reblog-snapshot\"><div class=\"reblogger-note\"><p class=\"reblogger-headline\"><img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/100aa1c08f8ec8a2d3740400f8d5af5a?s=32&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-32' height='32' width='32' /><a href=\"http://allaboutmanners.wordpress.com/author/allaboutmanners/\">allaboutmanners</a>:</p><div class='reblogger-note-content'><blockquote><p>Nice!</p>\n</blockquote></div></div><div class=\"reblog-post\"><p class=\"reblog-from\"><img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/9dbd378c2aebf40cfa8abaa9d6f9c052?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />Originally posted on <a href=\"http://funkangeles.wordpress.com/2013/01/23/your-story-whispers-of-darkness-faith/\">Funkangeles</a>:</p><div class=\"reblogged-content\">\n<div style=\"width: 621px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"http://sethsnap.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/dsc_00401.jpg?w=611&#038;h=407\" height=\"407\" width=\"611\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">WHISPERS OF DARKNESS</p></div>\n\n\n<p>Photography By <a href=\"http://sethsnap.com/2013/01/14/your-story-whispers-of-darkness/\" title=\"Whispers of Darkness\">Sethsnap Your Story: Whispers of Darkness</a></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><span style=\"color:#888888;\"><strong>Faith</strong></span></span></p>\n\n<p>Grays</p>\n\n<p>a splash of\u00a0snow</p>\n\n<p>muted reds</p>\n\n<p>thousands of branches</p>\n\n<p>wave hello..</p>\n\n<p>pavement</p>\n\n<p>perilous</p>\n\n<p>twist around berms</p>\n\n<p>to the calamity</p>\n\n<p>nature adds..</p>\n\n<p>water</p>\n\n<p>I can lose</p>\n\n<p>a turn</p>\n\n<p>But This \u00a0night</p>\n\n<p>a call, \u00a0far away from me</p>\n\n<p>Through the</p>\n\n<p>Whispers of Darkness</p>\n\n<p>Goosebumps\u00a0precedes..</p>\n\n<p>chills\u00a0reminds me.</p>\n\n<p>did i speak of love \u00a0last..</p>\n\n<p>did we forgave \u00a0tensions, passed</p>\n\n<p>this turn</p>\n\n<p>that turn\u00a0could be</p>\n\n<p>all we have</p>\n\n<p>seeing, only so far</p>\n\n<p>through the darkness</p>\n\n<p>calls for\u00a0belief</p>\n\n<p>what life. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0ahead\u2026</p>\n\n<p>awaits</p>\n\n<p>Whispers of Darkness</p>\n\n<p>Light is faith</p>\n\n<p>Light is faith</p>\n</div><p class=\"reblog-source\"><a href=\"http://funkangeles.wordpress.com/2013/01/23/your-story-whispers-of-darkness-faith/\">View original</a></p></div></div>", "post_id": 330, "location": false, "date": "01-23-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<div class=\"wpcom-reblog-snapshot\"> <div class=\"reblog-post\"><p class=\"reblog-from\"><img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/788c3fbc0ccebf297ed36413ac34fd46?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />Originally posted on <a href=\"http://realgoodparenting.com/2014/11/09/picture-this\">Real.

For example, the other day I explained to a 3 year-old that her screaming, throwing things and stomping her feet made me think she was very angry and mad. I reflected the same angry face to her to have her understand I was \u201cgetting her.\u201d In addition to teaching her the words of angry, mad, frustrated, etc., I drew a picture so that if she couldn\u2019t come up with the words, she could just show the picture to her parents or teacher.

I\u2019ve found myself particularly interested in hearing advice from women with lots of children, who have been doing this longer than I have. By no means am I suggesting that the experience of families with one or two children isn\u2019t relevant. My point is simply that the parents of several children engage in some seriously creative thinking to accomplish ordinary day to day tasks. This article is simply a collection of tips, gathered from \u2018Moms of Many\u2019, and is intended to supply helpful suggestions for homeschooling, maintaining your home, and generally keeping it all in balance.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><em>Tip #1: Before you start homeschooling, evaluate your home\u2019s discipline.</em></strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Every home has a method of discipline in place whether they realize it or not (I\u2019m using the word \u2018discipline\u2019 here to mean training, nothing else). You\u2019ve acted as a trainer, or coach for your child since the time they were born, teaching them to speak, tie their shoes, etc. Homeschooling is simply an extension of that role. Many people, especially those making a transition from public school, find it helpful to set aside a time for reflection, before jumping into that first homeschool year. Is the relationship between you and your child one that will easily facilitate teacher/pupil roles? Do you need to redefine your idea/method of discipline? This is the time to make necessary adjustments, even if it costs you some time in getting to the academics. Much better to address potential problems now, than deal with battles and power struggles while trying to teach math and phonics! Don\u2019t feel like a \u2018bad parent\u2019 if you find yourself needing to make some changes. Lots of people have made very positive adjustments that they may never have had the opportunity to address had they not been spending so much time with their kids through homeschooling! Think of your children\u2019s education as a house, with yourself as the architect and them as the builders/owners. This time of reflection is like the foundation. Once the foundation is set, you\u2019re ready to build!</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><em>Tip #2: Books and curricula are tools, nothing more.</em></strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Remember the house analogy: You\u2019re the architect, and the goals you determine for your children\u2019s education are the blueprint. You\u2019re also the supplier, since you have to provide your builders with the materials they\u2019ll need! We do have a responsibility to our children to research, and weigh the pros and cons of the different curricula available. But the idea that the end result is completely dependent on making the right choice of materials is not only flawed; it could really drive you batty if you let it! Yes, superior tools make a job easier, but they don\u2019t build on their own. Some of the materials you get may not be ideal, but time and money constraints require that you find a way to make them work. Others may simply not be right for the job. It\u2019s up to you to decide where to draw that line. A word of encouragement for those of you who experience \u2018curricula anxiety\u2019; the abundance of choices available in the curricula market today wasn\u2019t there twenty years ago, and homeschooling pioneers did very well with what they had available to them. Again, be grateful for all of the choices out there, but prepare yourself for the hard truth that there may not be a perfect curriculum that exactly suits your needs.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><em>Tip #3: Educate yourself about learning styles.</em></strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Much has been written on \u2018learning styles\u2019 in the past several years, and homeschooling offers a unique opportunity to tailor teaching to a child\u2019s specific personality. But don\u2019t get so caught up in the thought that everything must be specialized that you find yourself dissatisfied with everything that doesn\u2019t lend itself easily to your child\u2019s \u2018style\u2019. Incorporate learning style information into your teaching. Moms with several children discover first hand the benefit of using a variety of methods to explain the same thing. It gives you a better chance of being able to reuse that nonconsumable text! You can also teach your child about the way he learns, and help him find ways to adapt information. Of course, there\u2019s always the option to change a book or curriculum that isn\u2019t doing the job. But by not limiting yourself to curricula that are \u2018style-specific\u2019, you may enrich your experience with a great program that you may not have chosen had you known that it was \u2018visual\u2019, etc. And you will definitely increase your child\u2019s chances for success through college and beyond. Not many professors or supervisors are concerned with tailoring information to each individual\u2019s need, but a person who understands how to take unfamiliar materials and decipher them in his own way will have a valuable skill. If you\u2019re thinking that this sounds like a lot of trouble, you\u2019re right. It may be difficult in the beginning. But as your children grow, it will actually make the job of teaching them easier, because they will begin to realize what it takes to teach themselves.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><em>Tip#4: Effort spent on devising activities for a toddler is not wasted.</em></strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Those of you with little ones have probably already found this out the hard way! Try spending time with the youngest child before school time. Filling their need for attention first might help them to give you some time to focus on others. Keep some toys that are only brought out at school time, along with coloring books, paper, and crayons. If you have more than one school age child, consider having them alternate between one on one time with you and playing with younger siblings. There is the possibility that older children may balk at spending so much time with the \u2018baby\u2019. If this is the case, try describing this as \u2018preschool time\u2019 with the older child as the \u2018teacher\u2019. Use your own good judgment about what activities are safe and age appropriate. I\u2019ve suggested some resources at the end of this article, and many ideas that you\u2019ll find could easily be assembled ahead of time. Even if you\u2019re still in the same room, having a productive activity can have a \u2018quietening\u2019 effect.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><em>Tip #5: Don\u2019t feel guilty about getting outside help with housework.</em></strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>If you can afford it, that is! When you decide to keep your children at home to school, you\u2019ve added a responsibility that many parents have delegated to someone else. In the case of private schools, they are paying someone to assume that responsibility. If you have the means to pay for someone else to handle some of your domestic responsibilities, there\u2019s no more shame in it than there would be for paying someone to educate your children. Traditional maid services aren\u2019t the only option out there, you can hire an acquaintance to come help out with laundry (one mom I know has done just that), or come up with your own inventive solutions.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><em>Tip #6: Your kids can do more around the house than you realize.</em></strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>By and large, the trend that I\u2019ve seen in large families is to include children in daily household responsibilities. And the list of those responsibilities has ranged from taking care of younger siblings (in the teen years) to helping with laundry (at age 3). If they contribute to the mess, they can contribute to the clean up! Develop a list of responsibilities that they can ease into, and increase it as they get older. And if they ask if they can do something, let them try! The results achieved by a small person using only water may not make your floor look like it does after you\u2019ve mopped, but it may buy you an extra day or two before it requires thorough cleaning.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><em>Tip #7: Spend time planning ahead for meals.</em></strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>This can be as in-depth as \u2018bulk cooking\u2019 (cooking several meals in advance to keep in the freezer), or as simple as thinking about lunch at breakfast, and dinner at lunch. My personal modification to the bulk cooking idea is to cook large portions of meat at one time, using some of it for that night\u2019s dinner, and freezing the rest in entree sized portions. This way, I have it on hand for those nights when I find myself facing the stove with little prep time and/or energy! Experiment with variations of systems until you find what works for you.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><em>Tip #8: If you struggle with \u2018scheduling\u2019, try routines instead.</em></strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>What\u2019s the difference between a schedule and a routine? A schedule is generally a timed plan; routines are regular, habitual procedures. Programs and systems that use schedules to get people organized can be wonderful things, and I\u2019ve included some links to popular ones below. If you\u2019ve tried to implement a schedule into your homeschool and found that it didn\u2019t seem to fit with what you were trying to do, try and develop some routines. They don\u2019t have to be done in the same order, or even at the same time each day, but you might set some general guidelines (before breakfast, before lunch, etc.). Experiment with a school routine. Are there things your children can do on their own? Make up a list, and get them in the habit of doing what they can on their own before they come to you. This may take some time to develop, but just as with other worthy habits (diligence, punctuality, etc.), the benefit will be that it will save time in the future.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><em>Tip #9: Take time to keep family relationships healthy.</em></strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>You may be concerned about all of the \u2018togetherness\u2019 of homeschooling. After all, \u2018Familiarity breeds contempt\u2019, doesn\u2019t it? From what I\u2019ve personally witnessed of homeschooling families, the opposite is usually true. One mother of seven told me that aside from requiring siblings to treat each other well, she considers a \u2018Family Night\u2019 to be of great importance to their family\u2019s peace. She and her husband also have a \u2018date night\u2019 with just the two of them as often as they can. A \u2018Family Night\u2019 might seem like overkill to some, I mean, aren\u2019t we together all day, every day, already? Well, yes, but don\u2019t underestimate the power of setting aside time just for enjoying each other, if it seems to be all \u2018business\u2019 lately. Sometimes we\u2019re spending less time together than we think, between rehearsals, music lessons, and sports. And while you may have reasons that preclude your going out of the house on a date with your spouse, there is something to be said for taking some one on one time for each other every day. It may not be until the kids are in bed, or it may just be a few minutes on the couch after dinner. Children can let you talk to each other for a short length of time, although it may take a few tries!</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><em>Tip #10: Remember why you do what you do.</em></strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>All of the moms I talked with mentioned a sense of spiritual responsibility concerning their children when asked about their reasons for homeschooling. They would also tell you that since their \u2018commission\u2019 to homeschool is rooted in their faith, it is that same faith that sustains them when doubts or hard times hit. There will be times when it will be enough to take a hot bath and a two-day break. But there will definitely be times when you find yourself wondering, \u2018Why am I doing this?\u2019 You probably have \u2018heart reasons\u2019 for deciding to homeschool your children. Examine them well, and be ready to reaffirm them to yourself when those hard times come. Knowing that those times will come is probably the best information you can have, along with knowing that other people experience it, too! But even the best advice won\u2019t make decisions for you, or magically pull all of the pieces into place. Forming your family\u2019s own homeschooling style is something that takes time. Ours is still developing after four years, and it continues to develop as I encounter and incorporate new ideas. I hope that these tips can help you in the ongoing process of living out the decision to educate at home. Your homeschooling journey may not be bump free, but you can make it a great ride. So hold on tight, and have fun!</strong></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>FOUND THIS ON THE INTERNET HOPE IT HELPS YOU?</strong></span></p></blockquote>\n</div>\n", "post_id": 3312, "location": false, "date": "11-10-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<div class=\"wpcom-reblog-snapshot\"> <div class=\"reblog-post\"><p class=\"reblog-from\"><img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/4ac44b3c3771d85559e9a75819142d59?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />Originally posted on <a href=\"http://thekingdomdrivenfamily.com/2014/11/10/redeeming-the-time\">The Kingdom-Driven Family</a>:</p><div class=\"reblogged-content\">\n<p><a href=\"http://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/redeemingtime.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright wp-image-944 size-medium\" src=\"http://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/redeemingtime.jpg?w=300&#038;h=145\" height=\"145\" width=\"300\" alt=\"redeemingtime\"></a>Whether you are homeschooling one child or a number of them, it is important for the homeschooling parent/teacher to use her time and her children\u2019s time wisely.

again&#8230;comes around quickly, doesn&#8217;t it?! But if you&#8217;re in a state of denial about your credit card bills,\u00a0or still paying off the summer holiday or catalogue bills,\u00a0then\u00a0the thought of spending out on all the Christmas expense can send you into a cold sweat &#8211; and you really don&#8217;t want to get a bad credit rating just because of Christmas.\u00a0But there is still time to get your finances in some kind of order before the seasonal festivities kick in.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"article-body\">\n<p>We&#8217;ve put together\u00a0ten top\u00a0tips that help us get through the Christmas season without going into the red or finding yourself with a bad credit history. Plus &#8211; we have a great list of money saving websites for\u00a0you.</p>\n<p><img class=\"article-image-right aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/cdn.netmums.com/assets/images/2014/woman_buying_christmas_presents_online_250x185.jpg\" alt=\"Pre_Christmas money saving tips\" /></p>\n<h2>1. Be a savvy Internet shopper</h2>\n<p>Are you familiar with voucher code websites which tell you about all the discounts available at various online retailers? They\u00a0allow you to access a shopping code you enter at the checkout to get a discount &#8211; this might be money off (eg. spend \u00a350 get \u00a35 off) or free delivery. Take a look at the\u00a0<a href=\"http://forums.moneysavingexpert.com/forumdisplay.html?f=38\" target=\"_blank\">discount codes</a>\u00a0on<a href=\"http://www.moneysavingexpert.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\"> www.moneysavingexpert.co.uk</a>\u00a0as well as <a href=\"http://www.hotukdeals.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Hotukdeals.co.uk</a>\u00a0for details of the hottest deals around on a variety of items.</p>\n<p>Make sure you&#8217;re getting the best deal available on your shopping using price comparison sites, such as <a href=\"http://www.kelkoo.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Kelkoo</a> and <a href=\"http://www.pricerunner.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Pricerunner.</a> They work by simply comparing the price of your chosen product on a huge variety of online retailers so you can be sure you&#8217;re paying the cheapest price for an item. This is a particularly useful tool for more expensive purchases, such as electronic gadgets, where a few pounds can make quite a difference.</p>\n<p>For groceries be sure to check out <a href=\"http://www.netmums.com/scripts/linktracker.php?intLinkID=979\" target=\"_blank\">mysupermarket.com</a> &#8211; this also works like a price comparison site, whereby you can load up your online shopping trolley but before you buy you can see a comparison of how much the same items would cost in other online supermarkets &#8211; the difference can be quite staggering!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.quidco.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Quidco </a>is another great way to boost your finances when you shop online &#8211; look on the site before you buy your chosen item, and if it&#8217;s listed you can buy through the site and then get cashback on your purchases. You can gain substantial cashback rewards, particularly if you use the site for expensive purchases, such as holidays or electronic items. There are great affiliate deals too.</p>\n<h2>2. Write a list&#8230;and stick to it</h2>\n<p>Make a list of gifts that&#8217;s you&#8217;ve seen in catalogues or online\u00a0and carry it around with you &#8211; tick things off as you buy them so you don&#8217;t duplicate. Also, if you know exactly what you&#8217;ve bought people you won&#8217;t overspend on additional surplus things you see while shopping. It&#8217;s very easy to find one member of the family has a whole stash of pressies in the upstairs cupboard which you forgot you had bought!</p>\n<p>Internet shopping can also help you avoid temptation &#8211; it&#8217;s less likely you&#8217;ll get carried away online than when you step into a &#8216;winter wonderland&#8217;-style shopping mall with temptation in every corner!</p>\n<h2>3. Make what you can</h2>\n<p>Christmas cards can really bump up the seasonal expenditure, and while there are cheaper versions<img class=\"article-image-right aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/cdn.netmums.com/assets/images/2014/chrismas_pine_cones_250x185.jpg\" alt=\"\" />around, a nice home-made card which the kids have put their creative efforts into is a lovely alternative. Crafty, home-made decorations are really fashionable &#8211; the over-dressed Christmas look is sooo over &#8211; so get the <a href=\"http://www.netmums.com/your-child\">children</a>involved in some Christmas interior design, too.</p>\n<p>Look out for magazines and catalogues\u00a0in the run-up to Christmas with features on Christmas decor for inspiration. Cheap but effective touches include dotting pine cones sprayed with artificial snow around the room, or making snow-flake paper-chains. Salt dough decorations are also really effective or decorate cheap plain\u00a0baubles with glitter for\u00a0a personal touch. You&#8217;ll also find ideas for table settings and recipes for delicious edible presents, such as home-made biscuits and preserves.</p>\n<p>Make hampers up for friends and family, filled with their favourite foods, such as yummy homemade fudge, shortbread or gingerbread men.</p>\n<p>Grandparents will love personalised presents from the kids. Why not pick up some cheap canvases from the <a href=\"http://www.netmums.com/local-to-you\">local</a> craft shop and do handprint or footprint pictures,</p>\n<div class=\"article-gallery article-gallery--alternative article--gallery--teaser is--blocklink\">\n<div class=\"article-gallery__image article-gallery-icon\"><a href=\"http://www.netmums.com/activities/g/homemade-christmas-gifts\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/cdn.netmums.com/assets/images/homemade_soap_400x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a></div>\n</div>\n<h2>4. Save on food shopping</h2>\n<p>Don&#8217;t be tempted by all those pre-packaged Christmas foods &#8211; they&#8217;ll cost you way more than cooking from scratch. Shop-bought mince pies, fancy stuffings and other pre-packaged goods might seem like a good idea but while they might save you a bit of time they won&#8217;t taste as good as home-made items. Home-made mince pies and Christmas cakes will always win out over shop-bought items and you can have some fun making them with the kids. Mince pies can be frozen so make up a batch in advance so you\u00a0don&#8217;t leave everything until the last minute.</p>\n<p>Look out for good wines, biscuits and chocolates on special offer or &#8216;BOGOF&#8217;\u00a0when you do the weekly shop and add a few items to your\u00a0basket instead of doing a mad &#8211; and expensive &#8211; trolley dash a few days before Christmas. Non-perishables will keep nicely in a cool dry place but be sure to keep your goodies away from the standard everyday food stuff so you don&#8217;t crack into it before December!</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also worth checking magazines from now on in for money-saving coupons &#8211; in-store magazines are particularly good and you can make quite substantial savings using their money-off vouchers.</p>\n<h2>5. Use cash-back credit cards</h2>\n<p>Why not use a cashback credit card for all your purchases? Used in conjunction with buying via Quidco, you can make your credit cards work extra hard for you too. Cards such as American Express and Capital One give you money back for using their cards, the proviso being that you clear your balance at the end of each month and you might just\u00a0avoid that bad credit rating.</p>\n<h2>6. Buy quality&#8230;without paying the earth</h2>\n<p>You can buy luxury, branded goods without paying a premium. One particularly good place for<img class=\"article-image-right aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/cdn.netmums.com/assets/images/2014/chrsitmas_present_wrapped_in_gold_bow_250x185.jpg\" alt=\"Pre-Christmas money saving tips\" />Christmas presents is TK Maxx, where you can pick up\u00a0&#8216;designer labels for less&#8217;. Its range includes prestigious cosmetic ranges and perfumes, including Clinique and Clarins, an impressive array of handbags and clothes for all ages.</p>\n<p>Look out for the toy section too &#8211; on a recent visit we\u00a0came across cut-price Playmobil and Lego items &#8211; and the homeware section has everything from beautiful lamps and venetian mirrors to luxury Egyptian cotton bedding and cushions.</p>\n<p>It can also be worth making a journey to a designer outlet village or factory shop. There are quite a few all over the country, with the best-known including <a title=\"This link opens in a new window\" href=\"http://www.bicestervillage.com/en_GB/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicester Village Outlet Shopping</a> near Oxford (shops include Molton Brown, Donna Karan, Jigsaw and Karen Millen), <a href=\"http://www.clarksvillage.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Clarks Village </a>in Somerset (featuring Coast, Gap, Monsoon and Marks &amp; Spencer) and the <a href=\"http://www.mcarthurglen.com/cp_designeroutlets.asp\" target=\"_blank\">McArthur Glen outlets </a>(in Ashford, Brigend, Cheshire Oaks, East Midlands, Livingston, Swindon and York).</p>\n<p>These are not the kind of places to come for specific purchases but if you fancy an afternoon shopping somewhere different or are after a particular brand you can make substantial savings on high quality products.</p>\n<h2>7. Buy and sell on our Nearly New board</h2>\n<p>While the name suggests all items are used, do take a look at our <a href=\"http://www.netmums.com/local-to-you/nearly-new\">Nearly New board</a> &#8211; sometimes mums are selling brand new items at very reasonable prices. Items including clothes and books feature, as well as <a href=\"http://www.netmums.com/baby\">baby</a> furniture and toys. Alternatively use the boards to sell some stuff and boost the Christmas kitty, as well as clear out some space for all those new Christmas purchases!</p>\n<h2>8. Remember your loyalty points</h2>\n<p>Make a point of using your Boots advantage card or other loyalty cards in the run up to Christmas for weekly household necessities such as toothpaste etc. and bump up your points so you can use them to buy presents. Look out for special &#8216;double points&#8217; promotions too &#8211; many stores have frequent incentives in the run-up to Christmas so take advantage of earning even more points. Read Martin Lewis&#8217;s\u00a0article on the <a href=\"http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/shopping/cheaper-boots-spending\" target=\"_blank\">&#8216;Boots Treasure Trove&#8217; </a>to find out how to take full advantage of all that Boots offers.</p>\n<div class=\"panel-related-links\">\n<div class=\"content-yell\">\n<h3>More money saving tips&#8230;</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2>9.Take five minutes out to\u00a0check your entitlements</h2>\n<p>Take a five-minute <a href=\"http://entitledto.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">entitlement check-up.</a> You could find you&#8217;ve been missing out on benefits and tax credits that are rightfully yours. While you won&#8217;t necessarily get your payments in time for Christmas you&#8217;ll feel good knowing you&#8217;ll soon be benefiting from some legitimate extra funds in the New Year!</p>\n<h2>10. Don&#8217;t go overboard</h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s very easy to go overboard but excess for excess&#8217; sake will only make you feel miserable when the bills come rolling in in January. Try to allot an amount of money you will spend on the kids and don&#8217;t be hooked into the notion that children &#8216;need&#8217; the latest high-tech gadget or toy, and that if you don&#8217;t buy it you&#8217;ll be a bad parent. In the run-up to Christmas ask the children to make a Christmas list, including one really special item that they really, really want &#8211; tell them to think about their choice carefully as that will be their main present.</p>\n<p>Obviously, if their choice is completely unrealistic you&#8217;ll have to explain why you can&#8217;t buy that particular item but most children will like the responsibility of making a list and looking forward to receiving that much-anticipated gift on Christmas day.</p>\n</div>\n", "post_id": 3322, "location": false, "date": "11-14-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["allaboutmanners animals aviation books breakfast cars children climate cooking dessert FAMILY food frog allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners ", "Dragon eggs"], "text": "<p id=\"yui_3_16_0_1_1416227350233_4840\" align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/dragonegg34.gif\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-3325\" src=\"https://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/dragonegg34.gif?w=200&#038;h=150\" alt=\"DragonEgg34\" width=\"200\" height=\"150\" /></a><strong><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><a style=\"color:#0000ff;\" href=\"https://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/dragonegg34.gif\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3325\" src=\"https://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/dragonegg34.gif?w=200&#038;h=150\" alt=\"DragonEgg34\" width=\"200\" height=\"150\" /><br />\n</a></span></strong></p>\n<p id=\"yui_3_16_0_1_1416227350233_4848\" align=\"center\"><strong><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">Dragon eggs, though very small</span></strong></p>\n<p id=\"yui_3_16_0_1_1416227350233_4873\" align=\"center\"><strong><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">Will yield a beast surprisingly tall.</span></strong></p>\n<p id=\"yui_3_16_0_1_1416227350233_4871\" align=\"center\"><strong><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">All it takes is a safe wet abode</span></strong></p>\n<p id=\"yui_3_16_0_1_1416227350233_4869\" align=\"center\"><strong><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">To yield a monster oh so bold.</span></strong></p>\n<p id=\"yui_3_16_0_1_1416227350233_4867\" align=\"center\"><strong><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">So if you find their eggs, it would set the world a shiver</span></strong></p>\n<p id=\"yui_3_16_0_1_1416227350233_4865\" align=\"center\"><strong><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">With the awesome possibility the beast may someday deliver.</span></strong></p>\n<p id=\"yui_3_16_0_1_1416227350233_4863\" align=\"center\"><strong><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">But if it\u2019s near the dawn of the day</span></strong></p>\n<p id=\"yui_3_16_0_1_1416227350233_4861\" align=\"center\"><strong><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">Take your find, then straight away</span></strong></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><strong><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">Invite your friends, but tell not what you found</span></strong></p>\n<p id=\"yui_3_16_0_1_1416227350233_4850\" align=\"center\"><strong><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">And create a huge omelet to go around.</span></strong></p>\n<p id=\"yui_3_16_0_1_1416227350233_4854\" align=\"center\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Walt Trizna</span></p>\n<p id=\"yui_3_16_0_1_1416227350233_4856\" align=\"center\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><a href=\"https://walttriznastories.wordpress.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://walttriznastories.wordpress.com/</a></span></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong>WHY NOT JOIN IN THE FUN AND SEND SOME POETRY IN</strong></span></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong>TO <a href=\"http://www.poetreecreations@yahoo.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.poetreecreations@yahoo.com</a></strong></span></p>\n", "post_id": 3324, "location": false, "date": "11-17-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["allaboutmanners allaboutmanners animals aviation books breakfast cars children climate cooking dessert FAMILY food frog allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners allaboutmanners "], "text": "<h1><a href=\"https://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/scan.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-3335\" src=\"https://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/scan.jpg?w=273&#038;h=158\" alt=\"scan\" width=\"273\" height=\"158\" /></a></h1>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>First credible study of effect of violent gaming on brain</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Test group of 22 young men showed &#8216;clear&#8217;

The most important part was getting the balance right. Once you could balance easily, the pedals could turn smoothly, to drive the wheels and get the bike moving.</strong></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>The same thing is true when it comes to choosing our food. Once we have learned to carefully balance the amounts and types of foods eaten, all the organs in the body will function smoothly and the body will work efficiently.</strong></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Following these ten tips will help you stay fit and healthy. It\u2019s as easy as riding a bike, once you\u2019ve got the balance right!</strong></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>1. Food is Fun\u2026 Enjoy your food</strong></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Sharing a meal with family and friends at home or at school is a great way to enjoy food. It is fun to see other people\u2019s choice of food &#8211; what do your friends eat? Do you try different foods every day? Check out your lunch box or dinner plate. How many different kinds of fruit and vegetables can you spot?</strong></span></div>\n<div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></div>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>2. Breakfast is a very important meal</strong></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Just like cars, buses and trains cannot run without fuel, our bodies need energy to work. Especially after a night\u2019s sleep, energy levels are low. So, whether you are off to school, or out and about at the weekend, start the day with breakfast. Plenty of carbohydrates is just the ticket: try cereal with milk, fruit or yoghurt, toast or bread, perhaps with lean meats.</strong></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>3. Eat lots of different foods every day, variety is the recipe for health</strong></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>You need over 40 different nutrients (such as vitamins and minerals) every day for good health. Since there is no single food that contains them all, it is important to balance your daily choices. In fact there are no good or bad foods, so you do not need to miss out on the foods you enjoy. The best way to make sure you get the right balance is to eat a wide variety of foods each day.</strong></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>4. Which group would you tip for the top? Base your food on carbohydrates</strong></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>About half the calories in your diet should come from carbohydrate foods, such as cereals, rice, pasta, potatoes and bread, so it is a good idea to include at least one of these at every meal. Try whole grain bread, pasta and other cereals to give you extra fibre. Have you tried baking your own bread? It\u2019s good fun and smells wonderful!</strong></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>5. Gimme five! Eat fruits and vegetables with each meal and as tasty snacks!</strong></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Fruits and vegetables are among the most important foods for giving us enough vitamins, minerals and fibre. We should all try to eat at least 5 servings a day. For example, a glass of fruit juice at breakfast, perhaps an apple and banana as snacks and two vegetables at meal times. Then you have already reached your total. How many different kinds can you spot in the supermarket? Why not try some new ones?</strong></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>6. Fat facts. Too much fat is not good for your health</strong></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Eating too many of those fatty foods (such as fried potatoes, fried meats and sausages, pies and pastries) might not be so good for your body. Also go easy on fat spreads such as butter and margarines. Although we need some fats to get all the nutrients we need, it is better for our health if we don\u2019t eat too much of these foods and get knocked off balance. So, if you have a high-fat lunch, see if you can have a low-fat dinner at home.</strong></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>7. Snack attack! Eat regularly and choose a variety of snacks</strong></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Even if you eat regular meals during the day, there will still be times in between that you feel hungry, especially if you have been very physically active. Snacks can fill the gap, but should not be eaten in place of meals, only as an extra. There are lots of different snacks available. Your choice may be yoghurt, a handful of fresh or dried fruits, sticks of vegetables like carrots and celery, unsalted nuts or rice crackers, or perhaps a slice of fruit loaf or some bread with cheese. Occasionally, you may prefer crisps and other packet snacks, a chocolate bar, a piece of cake or biscuits. Whichever snack you enjoy, remember it is always good to include a variety of different types to keep things in balance.</strong></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>8. Quench your thirst. Drink plenty of liquids</strong></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Did you know that more than half of your weight is just water? So as well as giving your body all the food it needs each day to keep healthy, you need at least 5 glasses of liquids a day. It is particularly important if the weather is very hot or if you have done lots of exercise, to have plenty to drink. Usually \u2013 but not always \u2013 your body will tell you this, by making you feel thirsty. Plain water is great of course; you can try tap water or mineral water, plain or flavoured, sparkling or non-sparkling. Fruit juices, tea, soft drinks, milk and other drinks, can all be okay from time to time.</strong></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>9. Care for those teeth! Brush your teeth at least twice a day</strong></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Brush your teeth at least twice a day. Eating foods high in sugar or starches too often during the day can play a part in tooth decay. So don\u2019t nibble foods and sip drinks all day long! Sugar-free chewing gum can help you keep your teeth healthy. However, the best way to keep a nice smile is to brush your teeth twice a day with fluoride toothpaste. Also, after brushing your teeth at bedtime, don\u2019t eat any food, or drink anything but water!</strong></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>10. Get moving! Be active every day</strong></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Just like a bike may become rusty if it is not used for some time, our muscles and bones need to be kept moving too. Activity is needed to keep your heart healthy and your bones strong. It can also be good fun. Try to include some form of activity every day: it may be just walking to school and running up the stairs. However, games like skipping and football at break times are good for giving the body a workout. Swimming is a particularly good sport for keeping you healthy.</strong></span></div>\n</div>\n", "post_id": 336, "location": false, "date": "01-25-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}},

Library</a>\u00a0</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Let\u2019s face it, when writing poetry we have all been faced with the temptation to include rhyming words. They\u2019re fun, they\u2019re easy, and sometimes we still hold on to the belief that in order to write good poetry we must stick to rhyming. I myself used to be guilty of abusing end-rhyme in all of my poems. However, the hard fact is that unless you\u2019re Dr. Seuss or another famous children\u2019s poet, rhyming is going to do much for your poetry except hold you back. Here\u2019s why:</p>\n\n<p>1. It\u2019s annoying. This is the number one reason to avoid adding rhymes in your poetry. When you\u2019re a kid it\u2019s cute and fun, but as an adult? Not so much.

Nurture it and watch it grow.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>3) Draw a picture and mail it to Grandma and Grandpa. Or have them mail themselves a letter and see how long it takes to get back to them.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>4) Decorate rocks with tempera paint. Add eyes to make them into insects or animals, or start a rock garden by filling a decorated shoe box with soil and placing the rocks in it.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>5) Play with a magnet. Learn what it will and will not pick up. Attach it to string and tie it to a stick. Go fishing for paperclips.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>6) Spray paint 2 liter bottles and use them as bowling pins.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>7) Make a bird feeder by rolling a pinecone in peanut butter, then in bird seed. Hang it from a tree with string.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>8) Have your kids design their own placemats. Help them cover their art work with clear contact paper.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>9) Hide an object in a room and have your kids hunt for it. Tell them if they are &#8220;hot&#8221; when they get close to it or &#8220;cold&#8221; if they move away from it.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>10) Have your kids help you wash the car. Spray them when they are not looking, and be prepared for a water fight. Have fun and plan to get really wet!</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>11) Make macaroni jewelry. You can color the macaroni by mixing one tablespoon food coloring with two tablespoons rubbing alcohol and stirring in the dry noodles. Make several colors.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>12) Put a sheet over a table to create a tent and have a picnic lunch inside.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>13) Read and act out one of your child&#8217;s favorite stories.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>14) Go on a nature walk and study birds, leaves, and wild flowers. Try to identify them. Make a notebook of everything you learned about.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>15) Use craft paints to decorate an old t-shirt.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>16) Soak a cut celery stalk in a jar or glass of water tinted with food coloring. Watch what happens to it the next day.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>17) Have a Hula Hoop contest.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>18) Make a cake and let your children help you decorate it with colored frosting and candies.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>19) Have a sock war. Designate an area free of breakables, set boundaries, and divide into two teams. Start firing!</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>20) Start a &#8220;summer journal&#8221;. Help your kids write about the things you did each day and let them illustrate it. Keep these to look back on as they get older.</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n", "post_id": 381, "location": false, "date": "05-23-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<div class=\"wpcom-reblog-snapshot\"><div class=\"reblogger-note\"><p class=\"reblogger-headline\"><img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/100aa1c08f8ec8a2d3740400f8d5af5a?s=32&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-32' height='32' width='32' /><a href=\"http://allaboutmanners.wordpress.com/author/allaboutmanners/\">allaboutmanners</a>:</p><div class='reblogger-note-content'><blockquote><p>great advice</p>\n</blockquote></div></div><div class=\"reblog-post\"><p class=\"reblog-from\"><img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6fcda8bcd029bd9d79bca46266ce7508?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />Originally posted on <a href=\"http://livinglavidamommy.wordpress.com/2013/02/01/cooties/\">Living La Vida Mommy</a>:</p><div class=\"reblogged-content\">\n<p><a class=\"aligncenter zemanta-img\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/99406544@N00/5366348276\"><img class=\"zemanta-img-inserted zemanta-img-configured\" src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5241/5366348276_09bea8f8cd_m.jpg\" height=\"240\" width=\"240\" alt=\"Cootie\" title=\"Cootie\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Ugh.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s that time of year. \u00a0The cold weather means staying indoors, easily transmitting all the nasty little cootie bugs that the kids like to bring home from school with them. \u00a0And believe me, my kids are germ magnets, so there is lots of happy germ breeding in the winter months.</p>\n\n<p>Colds are common, but not a huge deal to me. \u00a0A sniffle or two here and there, usually nothing too serious. \u00a0Except that Noah, my little Stridor Prince, likes to turn cold viruses into scary, bouts of croup. \u00a0Every. \u00a0Single. \u00a0Time.</p>\n\n<p>Do you see where this post is going?</p>\n\n<p>Poor Noah has croup. \u00a0Again. \u00a0Only this time, he decided to show symptoms in the day time, during regular business hours for the pediatrician and the pharmacy. \u00a0The kids is losing his touch, what can I say?</p>\n\n<p>We called the doctor\u2019s office and they were even able to prescribe him\u2026</p>\n</div><p class=\"reblog-source\"><a href=\"http://livinglavidamommy.wordpress.com/2013/02/01/cooties/\">View original</a> <span class=\"more-words\">547 more words</span></p></div></div>", "post_id": 384, "location": false, "date": "02-01-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["dish cloths", "health and safety in the kitchen", "food", "postaday", "oven gloves", "safety", "cooking", "warm soapy water", "kitchen"], "text": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div id=\"safety_tips\">\n<h1 style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/fat_chef_cartoon_0515-1104-2202-3908_smu.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-386\" alt=\"fat_chef_cartoon_0515-1104-2202-3908_SMU\" src=\"https://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/fat_chef_cartoon_0515-1104-2202-3908_smu.jpg?w=226&#038;h=300\" width=\"226\" height=\"300\" /></a></h1>\n<h2><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Health and safety in the kitchen</strong></span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Follow these simple steps to keep you safe and hygienic in the kitchen.</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Wear a clean apron, tie back long hair and roll up your sleeves.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Wash your hands with warm soapy water, especially after using the toilet.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Cover any cuts or sores with a blue plaster.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Do not handle food if you have a bad cold or are sick.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Keep pets away from the kitchen area.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Do not lick your fingers or equipment during cooking.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>When you&#8217;re preparing food and cooking, always take care and take your time.

Answer any questions kids may have.</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Don&#8217;t force kids to ride rides that frighten them.</b>Kids should never be forced to ride a ride they are fearful of. Well-meaning parents could traumatize them and let&#8217;s face it, kids who become almost paralyzed with fear, scream, or become hysterical, aren&#8217;t having a good time. Ride operators report that many kid injuries needlessly occur when a child attempts to get off the ride or move erratically while the ride is in motion. Keep in mind that there is always next time when they may feel ready!</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Never leave kids alone to watch while you ride a ride.</b>\u00a0It&#8217;s difficult to juggle riding rides when one child wants to ride something and another doesn&#8217;t. But young kids should have an adult chaperone with them at all times. Don&#8217;t fall into the, &#8220;Stay here while I ride this ride with your brother and I&#8217;ll be right back.&#8221; Too much can happen.</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Establish a meeting place as you go through each section of the park.</b>\u00a0It is easy to become separated from your child, especially in large, crowded amusement park settings. Establish a easy-to-see place for each area of the park &#8220;just in case.&#8221; Don&#8217;t just point to an attraction and say to meet over there. Instead, walk with your kids and show them specifically where to meet (such as wait by this tree). Show kids what employees look like and any park security as well. Make sure they are well aware of\u00a0<a href=\"http://childcare.about.com/od/childsafe2/qt/stranger.htm\">stranger danger practices</a>and to not to leave the established meeting site for any reason. A park employee or security should be willing to wait with your child at a designated place if you and your child become lost as long as it is for a short amount of time only. Some larger parks have a &#8220;lost parents&#8221; section for kids and adults who become separated.</li>\n<li><b>Ask a lot of questions before letting your child go to an amusement park on a group-sponsored field trip.</b>\u00a0It&#8217;s not unusual for daycare centers to plan field trips during the summer or holidays in which they are open, for schools to have trips to an amusement park as a reward for a great year, or even churches to plan youth outings. But before you pay money and sign a permission slip, ask a lot of questions first. What is the adult-to-child ratio? How will these adults keep herd of the kids? Is there someone with medical training? How is money handled? What are their lost child practices? Ask these questions and more and make sure you are comfortable with the responses before you agree to the field trip.</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Remind kids again&#8230;and again&#8230;about keeping their hands and feet safely inside the equipment.</b>\u00a0Injuries can sometimes occur when kids try and stick out their hands and feet and get them hurt in the process.</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Know your child&#8217;s swimming ability and water comfort before choosing water rides.</b>Water parks also feature fast-moving rides that can result in getting soaked or perhaps even dropped into a pool of water at the end of the ride. Make sure kids know how to hold their breath, are comfortable with sudden splashes, and won&#8217;t panic when dropped into the pool from a slide. If so, this may not be the year to go to a water park&#8230;or else make sure there are plenty of kid-friendly places to have fun at.</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Trust your instinct about rides and ride safety.</b>\u00a0Be extremely cautious about letting kids ride on neighborhood carnival rides or equipment that makes sounds or appears old or run down. The rides involve heavy machinery and a certain risk in the unlikely event something should happen. If a ride&#8217;s appearance makes you uncomfortable, don&#8217;t hesitate in declining to put kids on the rides&#8230;even if they nag and beg to do so. Keep safety first!</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n", "post_id": 396, "location": false, "date": "02-04-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["safety agreement", "SAFE ON

It\u2019s common for us to hear from someone in their twenties or\u00a0thirties or even older who hasn\u2019t been to the dentist since childhood. Recently, a 16-year-old girl whose mother has a dental phobia called the helpline. The mother had never taken the daughter to the dentist \u2013 and now the girl desperately wanted to have a dental check-up.&#8221;</strong></span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"color:#ff6600;\"><strong>Dental advances</strong></span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff6600;\"><strong>If you haven\u2019t seen a dentist for several years because of fear or anxiety,\u00a0be reassured that\u00a0you should find the experience more bearable nowadays.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff6600;\"><strong>&#8220;Most people who are scared of the dentist have bad memories from childhood of the smells and sounds of the surgery,&#8221; says Karen. &#8220;Modern dental surgeries are much friendlier environments, with flowers in the waiting room, art on the walls, a pleasant reception area and polite staff.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff6600;\"><strong>&#8220;It\u2019s altogether a gentler experience. Of course, you\u2019ll still have the smells and sounds of the dental surgery but these are less noticeable than they used to be with instruments hidden from sight and background music playing. Even drills aren\u2019t as noisy as they used to be,&#8221; she adds.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff6600;\"><strong>Advances in technology have also\u00a0improved dentistry. Treatment can now be completely painless. The dental wand (a computerised injection system that looks like a pen and delivers the anaesthetic very slowly so it is painless) is great for anyone with a needle phobia.\u00a0A numbing gel can also be used to numb your gums before an injection so you don\u2019t feel the\u00a0needle.</strong></span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"color:#ff6600;\"><strong>8 tips to ease dental fear</strong></span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff6600;\"><strong>If you\u2019re\u00a0anxious about seeing the dentist, here are Karen\u2019s tips to ease the fear:</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff6600;\"><strong>Find an understanding dentist. Ask friends and family if they can recommend one or look for someone who advertises themselves as an expert with anxious patients.<a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/servicedirectories/Pages/ServiceSearch.aspx?ServiceType=Dentist\"><span style=\"color:#ff6600;\">Search for your local dentists here</span></a>.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff6600;\"><strong>Once you&#8217;ve found someone you think may be suitable, visit the surgery to have a look around, meet the receptionist and dentist and see the environment. Tell the dentist that you&#8217;re anxious so they know beforehand.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff6600;\"><strong>Pick an appointment time early in the morning so you have less time to dwell on\u00a0it.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff6600;\"><strong>The first appointment will simply be a check-up so don\u2019t worry that you\u2019ll be launched into having a filling, the drill or a needle. See\u00a0this first\u00a0visit\u00a0as your chance to\u00a0get to know the dentist.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff6600;\"><strong>Take a friend with you to your appointment. The dentist won\u2019t mind if they accompany you throughout the check-up or treatment.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff6600;\"><strong>Agree a\u00a0sign with the dentist to signal that you need a break and want them to stop. It can be as simple as pointing your finger, and will help you feel more in control.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff6600;\"><strong>If you think it will help, start gradually with a clean and polish then work up to more extensive treatment once you\u2019ve built up trust and rapport with your dentist.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff6600;\"><strong>Take\u00a0a\u00a0personal stereo\u00a0with you to listen to music during your visit. It will help you relax.</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span style=\"color:#ff6600;\"><strong>NHS sedation clinics\u00a0</strong></span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff6600;\"><strong>If you&#8217;re extremely nervous, ask your dentist to refer you to an NHS sedation clinic. These clinics are specifically for nervous dental patients.\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff6600;\"><strong>Some people find simple inhalation sedation very helpful to relax them for dental treatment.

It wasn\u2019t until the eighteenth century and the influence of French cooking and their thin crepes that pancakes more as we know them now.\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Pancake Customs in the UK and Ireland</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u2018Shroving\u2019 was a custom in which children sang or recited poetry in exchange for food or money. \u2018Lent Crocking\u2019 was one of the many customs of the day when children would pass from house to house asking for pancakes. If they weren&#8217;t given any broken crockery would be thrown at the door!</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Other customs and superstitions included the belief that the first three pancakes cooked were sacred. Each would be marked with a cross, then sprinkled with salt to ward off evil spirits, then set aside.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>In Ireland, Irish girls were given an afternoon off to make their batter and the eldest, unmarried girl would toss the first pancake. Success meant she would be married within the year.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>In Scotland, special oatcakes called Bannocks were made using oatmeal, eggs and salt and cooked on a griddle. A charm would be added to the dough and if an unmarried person found it, would be married within the year.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Wales also had their own customs where people would pass from door to door begging for flour, lard or butter. In some parts of Wales children would kick tin cans up and down the streets, believed to be commemorate the putting away the pots and pans for Lent.\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<p><span

Always thoroughly test your equipment before you leave home, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>checking all tent attachments are accounted for, and in working order</li>\n<li>cleaning and testing cooking and food equipment</li>\n<li>refreshing batteries, lightglobes and gas bottles</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Why not set up camp in your own backyard for a night or weekend before you go? The kids will love an overnight adventure at home and this is a great way to test much of your gear.</p>\n<h3>When you get there</h3>\n<p>Now you&#8217;ve made it to your destination, there are some rules of thumb to remember\u00a0before you start pitching your tents. Read our tips to set your camp up right.</p>\n<h4>Check your site</h4>\n<p>Select a flat piece of ground for your tents, avoiding areas with ditches that may become puddles or even ponds in a heavy rain. Check the surrounding trees for signs of weakness\u00a0or dangerous\u00a0overhanging branches, and\u00a0clear the floor space, removing any objects that will cause uncomfortable lumps in your tent floor.\u00a0Ensure that you position your tent facing the correct way before you start setting it up \u2013 you\u2019d be surprised how often a tent is set up facing the wrong way!</p>\n<h4>Protecting food and rubbish</h4>\n<p>It is essential to protect your food and rubbish from the local wildlife, as they are notoriously curious around known camping areas. The best way is to keep foodstuffs in tightly sealed containers or high off the ground. You can purchase hanging food-safes and\u00a0lockable eskies,\u00a0or simply keep your food and rubbish bag in the\u00a0car overnight.\u00a0Always\u00a0empty your camp rubbish at least once a day and each time you leave camp.</p>\n<h4>Drying your washing</h4>\n<p>Most national parks no longer allow campers to tie washing lines around the trees, since they can cause considerable damage. Many campgrounds now provide poles in each camp area for this purpose, but it&#8217;s always best to be prepared. Bring along a foldable clothes airer or two.\u00a0If you have more than one tent, stringing washing lines between them is also a handy option.</p>\n<h4>Cooking fish</h4>\n<p>There&#8217;s nothing like fresh fish for your camp dinner. Avoid that lingering fishy smell by\u00a0lining your frypan with aluminium foil, you can also roast fish whole in the foil &#8211; just place it under the hot coals of your campfire until cooked. Delicious!</p>\n<h4>Rainy day fun</h4>\n<p>Be sure to bring along an activity box for when the weather turns bad. Fill it with fun stuff like board games, decks of cards, jigsaw puzzles and\u00a0colouring books. Add a blank scrapbook for each child, and a glue stick, too &#8211; they can make a holiday storybook or collect natural objects from around the campsite to create a\u00a0collage.</p>\n<h4>Keep the tent clean</h4>\n<p>Let\u2019s face it, it is almost impossible to keep sand, grit and other \u2018floaties\u2019 out of the tent, but there are some ways to keep it to a minimum:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Place a shallow tray of water near the door, and a towel just inside the door \u2013 rinse your feet in the tray, then step onto the towel to dry them off.</li>\n<li>Keep a small dustpan and brush near the door of your tent \u2013 use the brush to dust off your feet before stepping into the tent, and then tidy up any mess you\u2019ve missed once you step inside.</li>\n<li>Ban shoes in the tent \u2013 they carry dirt, mud and sand around, and are almost impossible to dust off properly. Keeping them off in the tent will make a big difference.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Some handy camping essentials to remember:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Wire toaster:</strong>\u00a0Wire toasters are available in most camping stores and cost very little. These are a classic camping implement!</li>\n<li><strong>Stretcher beds:</strong>\u00a0Easily packed away into a small bag, these save more space and time than air-beds. They are inexpensive and available\u00a0at camping and department stores. Also great for sleepovers!</li>\n<li><strong>Fire-starters:\u00a0</strong>You can buy a range of fire-starters, but here&#8217;s a handy hint: collect your candle stubs at home\u00a0for camping &#8211; they make perfect fire starters. Just light and place under\u00a0your fire&#8217;s\u00a0tinder.</li>\n<li><strong>Octopus straps:\u00a0</strong>Bring along an assortment of sizes, as &#8216;occy straps are a camper&#8217;s best friend. Handy for securing so many things,\u00a0do not leave home without a few!</li>\n<li><strong>Wet weather ponchos:\u00a0</strong>Easily purchased at camping and department stores, plastic ponchos are cheap and effective in wet weather, and some fold away to about the size of your palm.</li>\n<li><strong>Ready backpack:\u00a0</strong>A comfy\u00a0backpack stocked with a small picnic set, torch, lighter, first aid kit, wet wipes,\u00a0insect repellant and\u00a0sunscreen will make a handy kit for most small outings away from camp.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4></h4>\n", "post_id": 443, "location": false, "date": "02-15-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<div class=\"wpcom-reblog-snapshot\"><div class=\"reblogger-note\"><p class=\"reblogger-headline\"><img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/100aa1c08f8ec8a2d3740400f8d5af5a?s=32&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-32' height='32' width='32' /><a href=\"http://allaboutmanners.wordpress.com/author/allaboutmanners/\">allaboutmanners</a>:</p><div class='reblogger-note-content'><blockquote><p>a moment with gran  great memories</p>\n</blockquote></div></div><div class=\"reblog-post\"><p class=\"reblog-from\"><img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d4fcc817a4840354ff6f3b35ce294ca5?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />Originally posted on <a href=\"http://behindthewillows.com/2013/02/15/this-moment-all-smiles/\">Behind the Willows</a>:</p><div class=\"reblogged-content\">\n<p><em>A Friday</em> ritual<em>.

It started with sticking and glitter at 7,30am as the kids added photographs to their books. Then Daddy took them to Cambridge and on to Granddad\u2019s\u00a0for the afternoon so I was able to \u2018glam up\u2019 a bit and take some\u00a0head-shot\u00a0photographs to save me the cost of a photographer.</p>\n\n<p>My remote switch and tripod are both broken so I had to make do with my mini tripod, a box and the ten-second timer.

One school of thought claims that working mums are far more likely to spend their time with their kids in a focused and unselfish way, dictated by the sentiment that their time with them is possibly more limited. The other camp cites the increase in the reliance of smart technology as having a detrimental effect on the time spent with the children. Never being able to demarcate the blurry line between work and home, perhaps with the added pressures of having to work harder to overcome prejudices of part time work, some working mums find themselves nose down in laptop or stabbing away at their Blackberry even before breakfast has finished.</p>\n<p>How can busy working mums ensure that the time spent with their kids is spent in a fully focused way?</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Make it a \u201ctask\u201d.</strong>\u00a0This may sound contentious: Who would consider that spending time with your own children could be considered a chore? This is not what this is about. A task is not necessarily a chore or something that is undesirable. However, tasks often are moved high in the list of priorities because of the perception that they are a requirement, something that must be done. If it helps, think of it as a goal. Too often, the reason that working mums struggle to be fully present with their kids, is because a work or home task has become urgent and has taken priority. If the time spent with the kids is considered in the same way, it then becomes the priority. Create a list of activities that you would like to do with your kids each week, capture them on a calendar and allocate time to them. Then stick to it!</li>\n<li><strong>Switch off the phone.</strong>\u00a0Stop it bleeping and flashing. By responding immediately to every request and query you are setting untenable expectations for yourself. When you are with the kids, be with the kids. This tactic will also help your children understand the difference between working time and down time and will be far less likely to interrupt you on the phone during an important business call. Just think, they perhaps consider your answering of the phone during \u2018their\u2019 time is a rude interruption and therefore the behaviour is endorsed.</li>\n<li><strong>Get out of the house.</strong>\u00a0Especially if your office is your home. It doesn\u2019t need to involve costly entrance prices to theme parks; it just requires a change of scene. By making a big deal of the time, you are shifting expectations of both yourself and your children. Watch as their behaviour improves as the quality of your focus on them is heightened.</li>\n<li><strong>Be naturally curious.\u00a0</strong>Of course children can natter on about the most ridiculously meaningless things on a very regular basis, and the temptation is always there to enforce a \u2018quiet\u2019 meal time to quell the maelstrom of noise in your head. Occasionally make it your target to find out things about your children you never knew, they will, at times, amaze you.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You\u2019ll hear the clich\u00e9 many times that the childhood stage is fleeting. As a working mother, it can feel like an eternity at times, however, there will come a day when suddenly the realisation hits that the kids have grown up. Ensure that you have the memories you\u2019ll want to treasure.</p>\n</div>\n", "post_id": 481, "location": false, "date": "02-19-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["food", "back to school", "postaday", "lunch", "salad vegetables", "Healthy eating", "breakfast"], "text": "<h2></h2>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Well actually it&#8217;s what&#8217;s in it that should be healthy not the box, unless your lunchbox has a secret life!</strong></span></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><img alt=\"fruit\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.cyh.com/HealthTopics/library/fruit-10.jpg\" align=\"left\" /></strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Your lunch should be a part of your balanced daily diet.\u00a0 Look up our topic\u00a0&#8220;Balanced diet&#8221;\u00a0if you haven&#8217;t seen it.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Lunch is an important meal.

They will do their school homework because they know they have to but sometimes homework just gets old and annoying! So&#8230; it is up to us parents to make sure our children get the education they deserve. Here are some ways to give homework help to the kids.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#3366ff;\">Start out by making a fun atmosphere. Do you have an easel? Allow your child to use it for math calculations instead of jotting them down on paper. Let your child use the easel to practice handwriting or even make a check list of things for them to do and let them check items off as they do them. A visual technique is often something that will help in more ways than you might think. Just having something that is not &#8220;school&#8221; related, will encourage them to help them do their homework.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#3366ff;\">Be involved with the &#8220;act&#8221; of homework Some kids like to be alone to do their homework, but if they don&#8217;t (and even if they do,,, give this a try!) have them do their homework on the dinning room table and YOU sit there with them doing YOUR homework! Pay bills, do your scrapbooking, , do any &#8220;sit down&#8221; work or activity you have to do. Often, just having someone next to them that is a friendly face, no competition or stress involved, will allow your child to have a clear head from the stress homework often can be and they will be able to do better.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#3366ff;\">Be your child&#8217;s homework helper! If you are &#8220;at hand&#8221; while your child does their homework, they are more likely to ask questions when they need help. A good way to handle this is to find out what they have done so far or how they got to where they are. First, this will help you to determine where they need help and second, if they repeat what they have done, it will help them remember how they do what they need to do and better secure their learning the topic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#3366ff;\">If you have more than one child, have them do their homework together. The older one will be glad (we hope!) to help the younger one and in helping the sibling solve a problem it will increase the older siblings confidence in themselves. &#8220;I helped my brother and he did good&#8230;I did good too!&#8221;. And the younger sibling will be glad that\u00a0<a title=\"big brother\" href=\"http://voices.yahoo.com/theme/1580/big_brother.html\" rel=\"&amp;content_type=theme&amp;content_type_id=1580\"><span style=\"color:#3366ff;\">big brother</span></a>\u00a0(or sister) helped him out!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#3366ff;\">For younger kids, actual hands-on is a great way to teach them many things. Instead of sitting there just counting on the paper, give them marbles or spoons or any fun item and let them count those. To practice writing, have them write things that are dear to them&#8230; write names of their baby\u00a0<a title=\"dolls\" href=\"http://voices.yahoo.com/theme/870/dolls.html\" rel=\"&amp;content_type=theme&amp;content_type_id=870\"><span style=\"color:#3366ff;\">dolls</span></a>\u00a0or the names of their cyber heroes. Have them write a letter to grandma or even let them write your grocery shopping list. As they make new letters and spell new words, it will further enforce their writing talent and it was fun&#8230; not just a teacher standing up there reciting words for them to write.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#3366ff;\">For the younger kids, make &#8220;home&#8221; homework supplies. Get them their favorite cartoon pencils, colorful and specific themed folders and their own stash of writing paper. A brand new box of\u00a0<a title=\"crayons\" href=\"http://voices.yahoo.com/topic/34117/crayons.html\" rel=\"&amp;content_type=topic&amp;content_type_id=34117\"><span style=\"color:#3366ff;\">crayons</span></a>and other things they need. Just fill a plastic storage tote with these things to make it exciting for them to start homework at home.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#3366ff;\">Give them homework breaks. When you are at work, don&#8217;t you take a break every now and then to clear your head, get up and stretch and get a drink at the water cooler? Well, let the kids do the same. They get tired of just sitting, same as you do. So let them have a break &#8211; take it with them! Both of you (or all of you!) take a walk outside for a few minutes, get a snack, sit and chat for awhile. Then go back to the next subject. A fresh mind is always the best way to start solving a problem!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#3366ff;\">Got friends? If your children have friends, invite them over for a homework party! Have them all start a homework subject and then rotate their papers to grade each others homework. Not only is it &#8220;fun&#8221; to grade papers, but they can also learn from others mistakes. Maybe they had the same problem and can learn how their friend figured it out. Or even make suggestions to each other as to how to solve a homework problem they got wrong.

But in general, they like spending time with their friends at school, learning new things and being challenged.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Some other kids just dread going to school though. For these kids, going to school may become so stressful that they have temper tantrums over going to school or complain of\u00a0<a href=\"http://pediatrics.about.com/od/symptoms/Symptoms_of_Childhood_Illnesses.htm\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">symptoms</span></a>\u00a0such as headaches, stomachaches, or chest pain.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Why?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>For some kids, there is an easily identifiable trigger for school refusal, such as being\u00a0<a href=\"http://pediatrics.about.com/library/quiz/blquiz_bullied_scng.htm\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">bullied</span></a>, death in the family, or move to a new neighborhood. Following one of these events, especially if they are associated with the child staying home with a parent for some time, the child may not want to go to school any more.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Although school refusal has been associated with both separation anxiety disorder and social phobia, the easiest way to think about it is that school refusal is a &#8216;difficulty attending school associated with emotional distress, especially anxiety and depression.&#8217;</strong></span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Symptoms of School Refusal</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Not surprising, school refusal is most common in kids who are five to six years old, when they are just starting school and in their first year of kindergarten. It is also common in school-age children who are about 10 to 11 years old, toward the end of the last years of elementary school.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>In addition to having temper tantrums and crying when it is time to go to school, symptoms that children may have when they don&#8217;t want to go to school may include vague complaints such as:</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>stomachaches</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>headaches</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>nausea</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>dizziness</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>chest pain</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>joint pain</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Although these symptoms can also be found in children with other medical problems, one good sign that they are being caused by school refusal is that they get better later in the morning once the child understands that he is going to be able to stay home.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Other signs that a child&#8217;s symptoms might be caused by school refusal include that your child:</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>is gaining weight well.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>does not have a fever, vomiting, or diarrhea.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>does not have as many symptoms when he isn&#8217;t in school, including weekends and holidays.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>has no obvious physical signs of illness when you visit your pediatrician. For example, he may have joint pain, but no joint swelling or limited movement of the joint.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>in general has other fears, phobias, or symptoms of<a href=\"http://pediatrics.about.com/od/mentalhealth/a/anxiety_symptom.htm\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">anxiety</span></a>, such as clingy behavior, excessive worrying or nightmares.</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Managing School Refusal</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Of course, the main goal in managing school refusal is getting kids back in school. Unfortunately, when kids seem sick and are trying to stay home from school, it is not always easy to recognize that they are avoiding school.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>That is why a visit to your pediatrician is usually a good first step when your kids don&#8217;t want to go to school. This can help ensure that your child doesn&#8217;t have a physical condition causing his symptoms. Unfortunately, while a physical condition can often be ruled out after your pediatrician talks to you and your child and does a physical exam, some children with school refusal end up seeing multiple specialists and having many tests before a diagnosis is finally made.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Once a diagnosis of school refusal is made, it can help to:</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>make sure that your child goes to school each day, since the more he stays home, the harder it will be to get him to go back to school.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>understand that even though your child likely doesn&#8217;t have a physical problem causing his symptoms, that doesn&#8217;t mean that those symptoms aren&#8217;t real. So your child isn&#8217;t necessarily making up symptoms, such as stomachaches or headaches. They may just be caused by his anxiety about going to school.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>talk to your child and school staff to see if you can figure out what is triggering your child&#8217;s school avoidance behaviors, such as a bully, school performance problems, or trouble making friends.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>consider getting help from a child psychiatrist and/or a child psychologist, in addition to your pediatrician, especially if you feel like you are having to force your child to go to school each day.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>have a plan for when your child has symptoms at school, such as spending 10 to 15 minutes in the nurses office and then returning to class.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>keep a symptom diary and see your pediatrician on the days that your child feels like he really can&#8217;t go to school.</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>consider family therapy if there are any stressors at home, like a divorce, separation, discipline problems, death in the family, new sibling, or a recent move.</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>One of the most important things for parents is to be open to the idea that a child&#8217;s symptoms might be caused by school refusal and not a physical problem. This will help get your child back in school faster and avoid unnecessary medical tests. Even if you are not convinced that your child has school refusal after seeing your pediatrician, you can keep your child in school as you proceed with a\u00a0<a href=\"http://pediatrics.about.com/od/weeklyquestion/a/04_sec_opinion.htm\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">second opinion</span></a>\u00a0or further evaluation for a physical problem.</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n", "post_id": 502, "location": false, "date": "03-25-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["teens kids", "understand", "postaday", "celebrities", "entertainment"], "text": "<div id=\"blog_author_info\"></div>\n<div id=\"blog_title\" style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong><a href=\"http://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/kids9999.jpg\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-507\" alt=\"Portrait of a study group\" src=\"https://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/kids9999.jpg?w=300&#038;h=208\" width=\"300\" height=\"208\" /></span></a></strong></span></div>\n<div></div>\n<div id=\"entry_body\">\n<div>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>1.

That&#8217;s totally normal! But seriously, when we make photos look old on Instagram or Hypstamatic, we aren&#8217;t giving ourselves wrinkles and turning our hair gray.

That can be surprising until you understand what&#8217;s going on. The truth is that their intelligence often leads them down the wrong path when they first try to read. As the text gets harder they will find progress more and more difficult. So they end up on a reading plateau, with lots of wild guessing and a collapsing self-confidence. If you guide them back onto the right path, they will usually progress fast.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>There are actually multiple possible reasons for reading difficulty, but what I have described above is the most common. We call it Optilexia.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>The key to getting progress with reading for a child is to understand what is causing the difficulty. That might be Optilexia or eye-tracking difficulty or Irlen Syndrome or one of the other 7 causes of difficulty we see the patterns of routinely with the children we help.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Once you understand a child&#8217;s reading difficulty, guiding the child to success usually becomes fairly easy.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>So, at the heart of the Easyread System is a process of trying to understand the patterns shown by each child. We then make sure we apply the right help to get the child reading confidently. It normally takes around 6-9 months to achieve that.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>It can be quite complex, but we have had years of experience helping thousands of children, so there are not many things left we have not seen! And if we don&#8217;t succeed we do not charge for our help.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Learning to read is probably the most critical educational step in every child&#8217;s life. So we focus hard on doing everything we can to make it go the right way. English is a very tricky language to learn to read, so just going with your intuition on how to help does not always work out well. One in five English-speaking children cannot read by the age of 11.</strong></span></p>\n", "post_id": 517, "location": false, "date": "06-11-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<div class=\"wpcom-reblog-snapshot\"><div class=\"reblogger-note\"><p class=\"reblogger-headline\"><img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/100aa1c08f8ec8a2d3740400f8d5af5a?s=32&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-32' height='32' width='32' /><a href=\"http://allaboutmanners.wordpress.com/author/allaboutmanners/\">allaboutmanners</a>:</p><div class='reblogger-note-content'><blockquote><p>love it</p>\n</blockquote></div></div><div class=\"reblog-post\"><p class=\"reblog-from\"><img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/f328803e074725ec86d933769c18c982?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />Originally posted on <a href=\"http://freelittlewords.wordpress.com/2013/02/26/i-love-you-anyway/\">Free Little Words</a>:</p><div class=\"reblogged-content\">\n<p><a href=\"http://freelittlewords.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/anyway.jpg\" title=\"I Love You Anyway\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-699 alignleft\" style=\"width:257px;height:335px;margin-right:6px;\" src=\"http://freelittlewords.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/anyway.jpg?w=229&#038;h=300\"   alt=\"anyway\" title=\"I Love You Anyway\"></a><strong>Anytime, anywhere, anyhow.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Anywhere</strong> you go, my love will follow you.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Anytime</strong> you need a shoulder, please lean on mine.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Anything</strong> you need, just ask.</p>\n\n<p>There isn\u2019t <strong>anyone</strong> who loves you more than I do.</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019ll love you in<strong> anyplace</strong>-first, second or last.</p>\n\n<p>My heart is full of love for you. <strong>Anymore</strong> and it will overflow.</p>\n\n<p>That\u2019s a known\u00a0fact,<strong> anyhow!</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Anyway</strong> you look at it, I love you.</p>\n</div><p class=\"reblog-source\"><a href=\"http://freelittlewords.wordpress.com/2013/02/26/i-love-you-anyway/\">View original</a></p></div></div>", "post_id": 520, "location": false, "date": "02-26-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["climate", "kids", "science", "postaday", "fast", "environment", "advertising", "education", "grow up"], "text": "<h1><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">:<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong>kid&#8217;s today They really are growing up fast:</strong></span></span><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></h1>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Calls for initiatives to ensure that children\u2019s outdoor play and connection to nature are encouraged</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>All forms of marketing directed at children up to at least age seven &#8216;should be banned&#8217;</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong><img class=\"aligncenter\" alt=\"Children are growing up too quickly because of modern life.

That seems like such a long time ago now, but school food is still a massively important issue to me, as I\u2019m sure it is to all of you. It still gets talked about all the time in the British press,and there are some truly brilliant and inspiring schools, headteachers, caterers and dinner ladies out there doing great things to make sure the food they serve our kids is healthy and nutritious. Big love to them!</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#800080;\"><strong>Over the past 5 or 6 years, big changes have been made to school food. These changes are still going strong today and,to be honest, we\u2019ve advanced much further than I first thought we would. We\u2019ve all learned a lot, and I can\u2019t tell you how wonderful it is to see so many people committed to feeding our children better at school; it makes the blood, sweat and tears of the early days of the campaign totally worth it.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#800080;\"><strong>But our work is far from over. Childhood obesity is still a problem. The UK has the highest rate of childhood obesity in Europe, with 25% of young people being classified as obese or overweight. In 2005 I said that this would be a long road, and it will be.I know I will stick with it, and I hope you will too. Have a look through my school food pages to find out what I\u2019ve been up to as the fight for better school food continues.</strong></span></p>\n<p>Jamie Oliver</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.jamieoliver.com/core/images/schooldinners/slide1.jpg\" /></h2>\n<p><span style=\"color:#800080;\"><strong>There is an obesity epidemic in this country,and the emotional and financial costs of this epidemic are huge. The UK has the highest rate of childhood obesity in Europe, with 25% of young people being classified as obese or overweight. The Government\u2019s Foresight report suggests this will only get worse, with 40% of Britons expected to beobese by 2025 \u2013 unless we all do something about it.\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#800080;\"><strong>A school meal accounts for one-third of a child\u2019s daily nutritional intake. For many children up and down the country, the majority of food they are fed at home is either made up of ready meals, takeaways or \u2013 in the worst cases \u2013 nothing at all. This means the meal they eat at school will be the only nutritious food they eat that day. Encouraging children to make better food choices at school is absolutely vital.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#800080;\"><strong>Jamie has long advocated that children who are fed better, do better. Recent research supports this and has proved that no matter what background a child is from, a hot, nutritious meal at lunchtime improves their behaviour and concentration in the classroom in the afternoon. This is yet another reason why school meals should matter to everyone who cares about the future of the UK\u2019s children.</strong></span></p>\n", "post_id": 543, "location": false, "date": "02-28-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<div class=\"wpcom-reblog-snapshot\"><div class=\"reblogger-note\"><p class=\"reblogger-headline\"><img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/100aa1c08f8ec8a2d3740400f8d5af5a?s=32&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-32' height='32' width='32' /><a href=\"http://allaboutmanners.wordpress.com/author/allaboutmanners/\">allaboutmanners</a>:</p><div class='reblogger-note-content'><blockquote><p>I love this!</p>\n</blockquote></div></div><div class=\"reblog-post\"><p class=\"reblog-from\"><img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/55fd6b515e54ba36d094c7964c0912e3?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />Originally posted on <a href=\"http://thekittchen.com/2013/02/28/chicken-and-black-bean-chilaquiles/\">thekittchen</a>:</p><div class=\"reblogged-content\">\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><a href=\"http://thekittchen.com/2013/02/27/beer-and-cheese-and-chocolate/img_0481/\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-2780\" src=\"http://thekittchen.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/img_0481.jpg?w=584&#038;h=526\" height=\"526\" width=\"584\" alt=\"chicken_and_black_bean_chilaquiles\" title=\"chicken_and_black_bean_chilaquiles\"></a>I made a big batch of Chicken and Black Bean Chilaquiles and packed it up into 3 lunches to bring to work this week.

This time I used a Southwest salsa with corn (which I buy in 4 pound 6 ounce jugs and I go through one a month\u2026) and added shredded chicken, black beans, and kidney beans.

The family used to spend the summer holidays on a little Norwegian island, swimming, fishing and going by boat. When Roald was four years old, his father died, so his mother had to organise the trip alone for herself and her six children.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">At school, he was always homesick. At St. Peter&#8217;s Prep School, all the letters home were controlled by the headmaster, and afterwards at Repton Public School, he had to wear a horrible school uniform [with braces, waist coat, hat and lots of buttons, all black]. The younger boys were often punished by the headmaster and the older boys called prefects. Roald lays much emphasis on describing the school-beatups in his book. You could get beaten for small mistakes like leaving a football sock on the floor, for burning the prefect&#8217;s toast at teatime or for forgetting to change into house-shoes at six o&#8217;clock. The most terrible beatings, however, were given by the headmaster himself, who was also a clergyman. He was so cruel, that he made a pause after each beat to smoke his pipe and talk about sins and wrongdoing, while the boy had to remain kneeling. After ten beats, the victim was told to wash away the blood first, before putting on the trousers. By the way, this headmaster became later the Archbishop of Canterbury. Roald Dahl kept telling himself, that if this was one of God&#8217;s chosen men, there was something going very wrong about the whole business.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">After school, Roald Dahl didn&#8217;t go to university, but applied for a job at the Shell company, because he was sure they would send him abroad. He was sent to East Africa, where he got the adventure he wanted: great heat, crocodiles, snakes and safaries. He lived in the jungle, learned to speak Swahili and suffered from malaria. When the second World War broke out, he went to Nairobi to join the Royal Air Force. He was a fighter pilot and shot down German planes and got shot down himself. After 6 months in hospital he flew again.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">In 1942, he went to Washington as Assistant Air Attach\u00e9. There, he started writing short stories. In 1943, he published his first children&#8217;s book &#8220;The Gremlins &#8221; with Walt Disney and in 1945 his first book of short stories appeared in the US. His marriage with the actress Patricia Neal was unhappy. None of their kids survived, his wife suffered a stroke. When she regained consciousness, she could hardly read, count and talk. But Roald managed to nurse her back to health, so that she could act again. Nevertheless, he got divorced in 1983 and married Felicity Crosland. He recieved several awards, such as the Edgar Allan Poe Award.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">His collections of short stories have been translated into many languages and have been best-sellers all over the world. Among them are &#8220;Someone Like You &#8220;, &#8220;Sweet Mystery Of Life &#8220;, &#8220;Kiss Kiss &#8221; and &#8220;Roald Dahl&#8217;s Book of Ghost Stories &#8220;. He wrote TV series like &#8220;Tales of the Unexpected &#8221; and the novel &#8220;My Uncle Oswald &#8220;.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">His books are mostly fantasy, and full of imagination. They are always a little cruel, but never without humour &#8211; a thrilling mixture of the grotesque and comic. A frequent motif is, that people are not, what they appear to be. Mary Maloney in &#8220;Lamb to the Slaughter &#8220;, for example, is not a friendly widow, but a clever murderess. In his stories, the background is perfectly worked out: details are very close to reality.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">Roald Dahl didn&#8217;t only write books for grown-ups, but also for children, such as &#8220;James and the Giant Peach &#8220;, &#8220;Fantastic Mr. Fox &#8221; and &#8220;The Gremlins &#8220;. About his children&#8217;s stories he said once: &#8220;I make my points by exaggerating wildly. That&#8217;s the only way to get through to children.&#8221; Roald Dahl is perhaps the most popular and best-selling children&#8217;s book author. However, these stories are so sarcastic and humorous, that also adults appreciate reading them.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">Roald Dahl died in November 1990. The Times called him &#8220;one of the most widely read and influential writers of our generation&#8221;</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>I&#8217;ve Got a Golden

At the time, a\u00a0<em>humpty dumpty</em>\u00a0was a clumsy person, so the nursery rhyme was meant as a riddle. It doesn\u2019t actually state that Humpty Dumpty is an egg, so the aim of the reader is to guess what he really is. Of course there is not a person who knows the tale these days that doesn\u2019t know he is an egg. There is speculation that the nursery rhyme had an underlying meaning \u2013 in which Humpty Dumpty represents King Richard III of England and the wall his horse. Others have suggested that it refers to the downfall of Cardinal Wolsey at the hand of King Henry VIII.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><a name=\"item-9\"></a></span></p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">9</span></p>\n<div><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">Sing a Song of Sixpence</span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">\u00a0</span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">\u00a0</span></div>\n</div>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/listverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/songofsixpenc.jpg\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><img alt=\"Songofsixpenc\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/listverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/songofsixpenc-tm.jpg?resize=400%2C318\" width=\"400\" height=\"318\" border=\"1\" hspace=\"4\" vspace=\"4\" /></span></a></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">Sing a song of sixpence dates back to at least the eighteenth century. In the original, the tale ends with a blackbird pecking off the nose of the maid in the garden; in the mid-nineteenth century this was sanitized with the addition of a final verse in which a doctor sews it back on. While interpretations vary wildly, the four and twenty blackbirds are most likely simply a reference to a common practice in the sixteenth-century in which large pies were baked then filled with live birds which would escape when the pie was cut. This stems from the fact that a meal was meant not just as nourishment, but entertainment.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><a name=\"item-8\"></a></span></p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">8</span></p>\n<div><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">Rock-a-bye Baby</span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">\u00a0</span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">\u00a0</span></div>\n</div>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/listverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/rockabyebaby-willcox-smith.gif\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><img alt=\"Rockabyebaby-Willcox-Smith\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/listverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/rockabyebaby-willcox-smith-tm.jpg?resize=400%2C248\" width=\"400\" height=\"248\" border=\"1\" hspace=\"4\" vspace=\"4\" /></span></a></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">Originally titled \u2018Hushabye Baby\u2019, this nursery rhyme was said to be the first poem written on American soil. Although there is no evidence as to when the lyrics were written, it may date from the seventeenth century and have been written by an English immigrant who observed the way native-American women rocked their babies in birch-bark cradles, which were suspended from the branches of trees, allowing the wind to rock the baby to sleep. An alternative interpretation states that the baby is the son of King James II of England, who was widely believed to be someone else\u2019s child smuggled into the birthing room in order to provide a Catholic heir for James. In this interpretation, the cradle represents the Stuart monarchy.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><a name=\"item-7\"></a></span></p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">7</span></p>\n<div><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">Little Jack Horner</span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">\u00a0</span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">\u00a0</span></div>\n</div>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/listverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/picture-1-119.png\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><img alt=\"Picture 1-119\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/listverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/picture-1-119-tm.jpg?resize=288%2C350\" width=\"288\" height=\"350\" border=\"1\" hspace=\"4\" vspace=\"4\" /></span></a></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">The first recorded version of Little Jack Horner comes from the eighteenth-century but it is most likely to have be known since the seventeenth. In the nineteenth century the story began to gain currency that the rhyme is actually about Thomas Horner, who steward to Richard Whiting, the last abbot of Glastonbury Abbey before the dissolution of the monasteries under Henry VIII of England. The story is reported that, prior to the abbey\u2019s destruction, the abbot sent Horner to London with a huge Christmas pie which had the deeds to a dozen manors hidden within it and that during the journey Horner opened the pie and extracted the deeds of the manor of Mells in Somerset. It is further suggested that, since the manor properties included lead mines in the Mendip Hills, the plum is a pun on the Latin plumbum, for lead. The current owners of Mells Manor have stated that they doubt this interpretation.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">6</span></p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><em></em></span></span></p>\n<div>Little Bo Peep</div>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><em></em></span></span></p>\n<div></div>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><em></em></span></span></p>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/listverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/little_bo_peep_2_-_ww_denslow_-_project_gutenberg_etext_18546.jpg\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><img alt=\"Little Bo Peep 2 - Ww Denslow - Project Gutenberg Etext 18546\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/listverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/little_bo_peep_2_-_ww_denslow_-_project_gutenberg_etext_18546-tm.jpg?resize=268%2C350\" width=\"268\" height=\"350\" border=\"1\" hspace=\"4\" vspace=\"4\" /></span></a></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">The earliest record of this rhyme is in a manuscript of around 1805, which contains only the first verse.

The most common interpretation identifies \u201cMary\u201d with Mary I of England. The \u201cHow does your garden grow?\u201d may make mocking reference to her womb and the fact that she gave birth to no heirs, or to the common idea that England had become a Catholic vassal or \u201cbranch\u201d of Spain and the Habsburgs, or may even be a punning reference to her chief minister, Stephen Gardiner (\u201cgardener\u201d). \u201cQuite contrary\u201d could be a reference to her attempt to reverse ecclesiastical changes made by her father Henry VIII and her brother Edward VI. The \u201cpretty maids all in a row\u201d could be a reference to miscarriages or her execution of Lady Jane Grey.

It is possible that this rhyme is a description of the medieval \u2018Great\u2019 or \u2018Old Custom\u2019 wool tax of 1275, which survived until the fifteenth century. Contrary to some commentaries, this tax did not involve the collection of one third to the king, and one third to the church, but a less punitive sum of 6s 8d to the Crown per sack, about 5 per cent of the value. In the 1980s the theory was advanced that it made reference to slavery, but most scholars disagree.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><a name=\"item-3\"></a></span></p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">3</span></p>\n<div><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">Mary Had a Little Lamb</span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">\u00a0</span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">\u00a0</span></div>\n</div>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/listverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/picture-2-78.png\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><img alt=\"Picture 2-78\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/listverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/picture-2-78-tm.jpg?resize=234%2C350\" width=\"234\" height=\"350\" border=\"1\" hspace=\"4\" vspace=\"4\" /></span></a></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">The nursery rhyme was first published as an original poem by Sarah Josepha Hale on May 24, 1830, and was inspired by an actual incident. As a girl, Mary Sawyer (later Mrs. Mary Tyler) kept a pet lamb, which she took to school one day at the suggestion of her brother. A commotion naturally ensued. Mary recalled:</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">\u201cVisiting school that morning was a young man by the name of John Roulstone, a nephew of the Reverend Lemuel Capen, who was then settled in Sterling. It was the custom then for students to prepare for college with ministers, and for this purpose Mr. Roulstone was studying with his uncle. The young man was very much pleased with the incident of the lamb; and the next day he rode across the fields on horseback to the little old schoolhouse and handed me a slip of paper which had written upon it the three original stanzas of the poem\u2026\u201d</span></p></blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><a name=\"item-2\"></a></span></p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">2</span></p>\n<div><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">London Bridge is Falling Down</span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">\u00a0</span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">\u00a0</span></div>\n</div>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/listverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/london-bridge-is-falling-down.jpg\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><img alt=\"London Bridge Is Falling Down\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/listverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/london-bridge-is-falling-down-tm.jpg?resize=400%2C302\" width=\"400\" height=\"302\" border=\"1\" hspace=\"4\" vspace=\"4\" /></span></a></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><em>\u201cLondon Bridge Is Falling Down</em>\u00a0is a well-known traditional nursery rhyme and singing game, which is found in different versions all over the world. One theory of origin is that the rhyme relates to supposed destruction of London Bridge by Olaf II of Norway in 1014 (or 1009). Another postulates that the rhyme refers to the practice of burying children alive in the foundations of the bridge \u2013 though there is no evidence to support this. The\u00a0<em>fair lady</em>\u00a0referred to could be Matilda of Scotland who was responsible for the building of a series of London bridges, or Eleanor of Provence who had custody of the bridge income from 1269 to 1281.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><a name=\"item-1\"></a></span></p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">1</span></p>\n<div><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">Ring a Ring o\u2019 Roses</span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">\u00a0</span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">\u00a0</span></div>\n</div>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/listverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/ring-ring.jpg\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><img alt=\"Ring-Ring\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/listverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/ring-ring-tm.jpg?resize=400%2C296\" width=\"400\" height=\"296\" border=\"1\" hspace=\"4\" vspace=\"4\" /></span></a></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">Ring a Ring o\u2019 Roses first appeared in print in 1881 but it was being sung from at least the 1790s. Most people consider the nursery rhyme to be making reference to the Great Plague of London in 1665 but this view did not appear until after World War II. Furthermore, the symptoms don\u2019t describe the plague particularly well, and the words upon which the plague interpretation is based don\u2019t even exist in the earliest forms of the rhyme.

And although that may be true in some instances, there are ways that you can show your newborn that you love them and you&#8217;re glad to have them here. Whether you fell in love at first sight, or are still &#8216;feeling out&#8217; life with a new baby, here are 12 simple ways you can bond with your newborn today.</strong></span><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>1. <span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Become a close talker</span></strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>We laughed when we saw it on Seinfeld, but in real life, this is a great way to bond with your newborn. It&#8217;s said that newborns don&#8217;t have very good eyesight, so getting up close to your baby&#8217;s face and speaking gently to them can help the bonding experience.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>2.<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"> Cheek to cheek&#8230;</span></strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Or skin to skin, is more like it. A newborn&#8217;s most sensitive part just after birth is it&#8217;s skin, so having skin to skin contact with your baby is also a great way to bond. In fact, many hospitals are now encouraging new moms to hold their babies to their bare chest in the moments just after birth in order to help the baby warm up and feel secure, while allowing you to bond with him. You can also do this at home by making sure neither of you has a shirt on, and cuddle him onto your chest and drape a blanket on you both (so as to keep your baby&#8217;s back warm as well).</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>3. <span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Feeding</span></strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Considering that newborns will eat often at first (usually anywhere from every hour to every three hours), it can seem like a lot of time is spent giving a bottle or breastfeeding. Take advantage of these quiet moments and look down into your baby&#8217;s face while they&#8217;re eating. You can also stroke their face gently at this time. They say that feeding time is a time when newborns are most aware, especially of who is giving them that need. Keep in mind that if you&#8217;re breastfeeding, pumping bottles for later not only helps Dad get in on the bonding, but also allows him to get up in the middle of the night and lets you get some extra sleep!</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>4. <span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Dancing</span></strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>The right music can relax anyone, so why not put on some tunes and sway around with your baby in your arms? A personal favorite in the first months of my daughter&#8217;s life was some Jason Mraz, and &#8220;dancing&#8221; with her really helped not only with bonding, but also with stress reduction.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>5. <span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Tickling</span></strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Using a playful and quiet tone, tease your baby while tickling them in the usual &#8220;easy&#8221; spots, like the bottoms of their feet, under the arms, the neck, etc. The playful touch can help you bond with baby, and also might induce an early smile! Just watch for cues as to when baby&#8217;s had enough.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>6. <span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Singing and talking</span></strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Maybe you&#8217;d feel silly singing and talking out loud to your baby when they don&#8217;t understand you or can&#8217;t even answer in any way. But by singing or talking to your baby, you&#8217;re bonding with them and showing attention. It can be as simple as singing along to the radio, or telling them about what you&#8217;re doing. You can say things like, &#8220;Look! Mommy&#8217;s changing your diaper right now&#8221; or &#8220;Wow, Daddy just loves your cute little tummy&#8221;. But constant conversation with baby, as one-sided as it seems at first, will make baby feel closer to you and also teach them the mechanics of conversation early on.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>7.<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"> Bath time</span></strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Although some babies may not like bath time, most babies enjoy it. This can be a great time for you to bond with your baby. A newborn may be too young yet to splash around and play with toys, but you can certainly add an element of fun by making fun noises as you run water from a cup over your baby&#8217;s hands, feet, etc. Or just tell your baby about your day while bathing them, so you&#8217;re having a conversation while doing something relaxing.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>8. <span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Smile</span></strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>It sounds simple, but just smiling at your newborn can do quite a bit. Their eyesight gets stronger every day, and your smiles at baby may very well help induce them right back at you! Also, just the act of smiling can help you feel happier, and that leads me to number 9&#8230;.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>9. <span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Relax your mood</span></strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Babies are a lot like animals at first&#8230;.it&#8217;s very easy for them to\u00a0<i>feel</i>\u00a0what you&#8217;re feeling. So keeping this in mind, it makes sense that when you&#8217;re upset, stressed, or frustrating, newborns seem to cry or fuss more. But if you smile, talk in a sing-song voice, and just relax overall, your baby can feel that, too.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>10. <span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Make diaper time special</span></strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>I don&#8217;t think anyone actually\u00a0<i>enjoys</i>\u00a0changing dirty diapers, but since we&#8217;re resigned to having to do so, why not seize the moment and take the time to bond with your newborn? Personally, my daughter has\u00a0<i>always</i>\u00a0loved the diaper changing table, and I honestly believe it was a combination of good vantage point (she sits higher, which enables her to see more of Mom and Dad), and my singing and talking to her. You could also hand your baby some toys or play peek-a-boo with their diaper to make the time fun.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>11.<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"> Blankets</span></strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>When I had my baby shower, I couldn&#8217;t believe the amount of blankets I received and wondered what I&#8217;d ever do with all them. But as it turns out, using a blanket is really an excellent way to bond with your newborn, so I keep a few in each room of the house. The act of swaddling your baby can improve their mood greatly and reduce a lot of stress and fussing. As your baby gets older, just the act of wrapping them in a blanket and holding them close for cuddle time can also help release those lovey-dovey feelings.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>12. <span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Massage</span></strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><strong>Quite possibly the most important way to bond with your newborn, massage is an easy skill to master. Keep it simple and just use some baby lotion and massage them during diaper changes, bath time, after a nap, etc. It&#8217;s something you should be doing anyway, as a newborn&#8217;s skin tends to dry out very easily and quickly in their first few months of life. Use gentle touch and massage in circles on legs, arms, back and tummy. You can also point out each part as you do so to your baby. And taking the time to marvel at this little person&#8217;s parts and knowing that you helped to create that will help you feel closer to baby, too.</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n", "post_id": 583, "location": false, "date": "03-24-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<div class=\"wpcom-reblog-snapshot\"><div class=\"reblogger-note\"><p class=\"reblogger-headline\"><img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/100aa1c08f8ec8a2d3740400f8d5af5a?s=32&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-32' height='32' width='32' /><a href=\"http://allaboutmanners.wordpress.com/author/allaboutmanners/\">allaboutmanners</a>:</p><div class='reblogger-note-content'><blockquote><p>good story </p>\n</blockquote></div></div><div class=\"reblog-post\"><p class=\"reblog-from\"><img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/1c3ead1a5cb93943a1d5ea6d9a65c4f6?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />Originally posted on <a href=\"http://ruyiii.wordpress.com/2013/03/24/sun-moon-and-stars/\">Ruyi&#039;s Stuff</a>:</p><div class=\"reblogged-content\">\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"></p>\n\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-702 size-full\" src=\"http://ruyiii.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/sun-moon-and-stars_small1.jpg?w=630&#038;h=445\" height=\"445\" width=\"630\" alt=\"sun, moon and stars_small\"></p>\n\n<p>This story is about the sun, the moon and the three little stars.

Matilda is the superbright daughter of horrible parents who helps free her schoolmates and her lovely teacher Miss Honey from the tyranny of Miss Trunchbull, the headmistress.

Anak saya terus memaksa, <em>mendusel-dusel</em>, dan menjengkelkan anak-anak lainnya. Akhirnya ada satu anak perempuan umur 8 tahun yang mengambil pisau tertutup yang ada di meja dekat situ, dan bersama anak lainnya yang berumur 11 tahun, mereka mengancam, membuka pisaunya, membuka tutup pisau dan menempelkan pisau terbuka\u2026</p>\n</div><p class=\"reblog-source\"><a href=\"http://feetre.wordpress.com/2013/04/22/how-can-protect-our-kids/\">View original</a> <span class=\"more-words\">968 more words</span></p></div></div>", "post_id": 706, "location": false, "date": "04-22-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<div class=\"wpcom-reblog-snapshot\"><div class=\"reblogger-note\"><p class=\"reblogger-headline\"><img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/100aa1c08f8ec8a2d3740400f8d5af5a?s=32&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-32' height='32' width='32' /><a href=\"http://allaboutmanners.wordpress.com/author/allaboutmanners/\">allaboutmanners</a>:</p><div class='reblogger-note-content'><blockquote><p>great poem</p>\n</blockquote></div></div><div class=\"reblog-post\"><p class=\"reblog-from\"><img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8c50f2826c027f4a01fd6a6fca6cee1a?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />Originally posted on <a href=\"http://blackandwrite.net/2013/04/21/the-joy-of-children-a-tanka/\">Black and Write</a>:</p><div class=\"reblogged-content\">\n<div id=\"attachment_1660\" style=\"width: 261px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://blackandwrite.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/centerforjoyfulliving.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1660\" src=\"http://blackandwrite.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/centerforjoyfulliving.jpg?w=251&#038;h=201\" height=\"201\" width=\"251\" alt=\"Image Credit: centerforjoyfulliving.net\"></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image Credit: centerforjoyfulliving.net</p></div>\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">The joy of children</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">There\u2019s no greater innocence</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">In this savage world</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Our responsibility</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">To protect their purity</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">~</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em>~~ Dominic R.

Though her mother lived in an asylum until 1934, Bishop never saw her again. She was brought up by a succession of relatives, firstly by her maternal grandparents in Nova Scotia, under whose care she was largely happy, then by her paternal grandparents back in Worcester and finally by her paternal aunt in whose home Bishop remained for the rest of her education.

Indian view of what appropriate etiquette is, might seem a little quirky to foreigners but this is how we do it!</p>\n\n<p>1. When you meet an Indian for the first time, they will either shake hands with you or join their hands together to say \u2018Hello\u2019 in their respective languages, depending on how westernised they are. Since a typical (even the uneducated) person in India can speak a few words of English, you can safely expect to hear \u00a0\u2018Hello!

You probably saw this cat beckoning with an upright paw in shops, restaurants and sushi-cafes, often at the entrance. Sometimes it is also called the <b>welcoming cat</b>, <b>lucky cat</b>, <b>money cat</b>, <b>happy cat,</b> or <b>fortune cat</b> in English.I like how it smiles me and makes me smile in response. Even in a rainy day it gives me merry mood.

Especially if the mother was married to a dentist and one of us kids cracked a tooth biting down on the Queen\u2019s crown or the Beaver\u2019s tail. But that didn\u2019t happen very often.

It may be that you have simply grown apart, fallen out of love, or more seriously there may have been infidelity or abuse. At the point of separation emotions are usually running high, whatever the reason was for the break-up. This is not a good time for anyone to be making plans about the children and more often than not one party leaves the family home without making these plans.</p>\n\n<p>So what now? When you were together, both of you, as parents, took the role on together. Feeding, clothing, bathing, putting to bed, school runs, weekend activities\u2026etc. You both had the responsibility of being a parent everyday and now you are not together you must in some way share that responsibility to make it normal for your children.

When I was small I thought I just don\u2019t understand them yet. Maybe they had to do it. I thought that\u2019s necessary. Then years passed and now I\u2019m 23 years old and still every time I think of those years she hit me and hurt me not just physically but emotionally and psychologically as well, I seemed to be more confused.

Unfortunately, many people are unaware of the potential dangers lurking in the garden environment. From drowning in ponds and harmful plants or insects to accidents and misuse of tools, garden dangers are real and should be a cause for concern. Teach children how to prevent these hazards by educating them on garden safety.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong>Steps To Follow</strong></span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong>Never, for any reason, leave children unattended outdoors or in the garden, especially near water. Although it\u2019s not considered a substitute for adult supervision, fences are a good way to keep children from wandering into dangerous territory. Consider fencing in areas near ponds and pools. Also, be careful not to leave buckets of water accessible to young children, as they can fall in and drown.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong>Make sure your kids know good plants from bad ones. Teach them never to eat any plants without the explicit consent of an adult. Point out any unsafe plants that may sting or prick them in the garden and elsewhere, such as rose bushes, holly and cactus plants. In fact, it may be a good idea to avoid these plants altogether if you have young children.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong>Teach children about bees and other stinging insects, including caterpillars, and how to avoid them. They should be made aware of their habitats and favourite hangouts as well. Explain to children not to touch or swat at these creatures. Also, make sure children always wear shoes outdoors and in the garden. Do not let them wear bright clothing or fragrances, which can attract stinging or biting insects.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong>Do not use power tools or lawnmowers when children are nearby. Likewise, don\u2019t leave garden tools unattended. While it\u2019s ok to provide them with tools of their own, be sure they are specifically designed for children and only used with adult supervision. Teach children the proper way to use them and when, and put them up after each use, teaching your children to do the same. Always help children if sharp tools are to be used, such as pruning shears.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong>Although it\u2019s better for everyone, especially the environment, not to use chemicals pesticides or fertilisers, if you must do so keep them away from children. In fact, lock them up.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong>Be cautious when it comes to staking up plants and using structures like trellises. Use tall stakes rather than small ones to prevent accidents or injuries. Children love to climb. Make it clear that only suitable play structures, such as monkey bars, may be used for climbing. Do not allow climbing on structures such as fences, or trellises, which can lead to falls and other accidents.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong>Finally, always encourage children to wash their hands after being outdoors and in the garden. Germs are the number one cause for many illnesses.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong>One of the easiest ways to instil garden safety in children is to start teaching them the basics at a young age and throughout their growing years. Try to be creative and keep the learning process fun. For instance, create a chart using pictures of safe and unsafe garden practices. Take them on frequent nature trips to help them become familiar with local plants and insects. Anything that you can think of that might strike up interest in your kids will help. After all, no one knows your children better than you do.</strong></span></p>\n", "post_id": 936, "location": false, "date": "05-09-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<div class=\"wpcom-reblog-snapshot\"><div class=\"reblogger-note\"><p class=\"reblogger-headline\"><img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/100aa1c08f8ec8a2d3740400f8d5af5a?s=32&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-32' height='32' width='32' /><a href=\"http://allaboutmanners.wordpress.com/author/allaboutmanners/\">allaboutmanners</a>:</p><div class='reblogger-note-content'><blockquote><p>GREAT ADVICE</p>\n</blockquote></div></div><div class=\"reblog-post\"><p class=\"reblog-from\"><img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/2870f00a8ed100c0c4abd3f34cb96d98?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />Originally posted on <a href=\"http://lovesellyoak.com/2013/05/07/whilst-the-sun-is-out-dont-let-burglars-spring-clean-your-house/\"></a>:</p><div class=\"reblogged-content\">\n<p><a href=\"http://lovesellyoak.com/2013/05/07/whilst-the-sun-is-out-dont-let-burglars-spring-clean-your-house/spring-clean_bdh/\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-712\" src=\"http://lovesellyoak.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/spring-clean_bdh.jpg?w=710&#038;h=1004\" height=\"1004\" width=\"710\" alt=\"Spring Clean_BDH\"></a></p>\n</div><p class=\"reblog-source\"><a href=\"http://lovesellyoak.com/2013/05/07/whilst-the-sun-is-out-dont-let-burglars-spring-clean-your-house/\">View original</a></p></div></div>", "post_id": 939, "location": false, "date": "05-09-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<div class=\"wpcom-reblog-snapshot\"> <div class=\"reblog-post\"><p class=\"reblog-from\"><img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8cb067878c38fb12857b0ab7857a1fc4?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />Originally posted on <a href=\"http://elenasbennett.com/2013/05/09/a-reminder-from-dr-dan-siegel/\">a blog about therapy</a>:</p><div class=\"reblogged-content\">\n<p><a href=\"http://elenasbennett.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/siegel-quote.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-623\" src=\"http://elenasbennett.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/siegel-quote.jpg?w=300&#038;h=300\" height=\"300\" width=\"300\" alt=\"siegel quote\"></a></p>\n</div><p class=\"reblog-source\"><a href=\"http://elenasbennett.com/2013/05/09/a-reminder-from-dr-dan-siegel/\">View original</a></p></div></div>", "post_id": 941, "location": false, "date": "05-09-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["going to the dentist", "families", "dental appointments", "common fears", "postaday", "dentist", "visit to the dentist", "parents", "dental hygiene", "children", "fear of the dentist"], "text": "<div>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/dentis.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-944\" alt=\"dentis\" src=\"https://allaboutmanners.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/dentis.jpg?w=226&#038;h=223\" width=\"226\" height=\"223\" /></a></p>\n</div>\n<div id=\"main\">\n<article id=\"article-section\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Both adults and children can develop anxiety about going to the dentist.

Pride of place goes to four glasshouses showcasing plants and atmospheres from tropical rainforests, subtropics, Mediterranean plants and an arid desert-like house.</p>\n\n<p>The tropical house is hot and humid and home to a variety of trees, climbers, ferns, shade plants and water features. The subtropical house is similar but slightly cooler, accommodating tree ferns, palms and pines. The Mediterranean house is a riot of colour in Spring and has lots of beautiful flowers in all shapes and sizes, complimented by the citrus centrepieces reminiscent of the type of the world they are found natively. The arid house is aptly named and dry, hosting all types of cacti and other desert-loving plants.</p>\n\n<p>Outside the glasshouses, sloping lawns give way to the pretty gardens and aviaries.

Or maybe even Nickelodeon\u2019s Slime?</p>\n\n<p>Here\u2019s the recipe to make it!! Have fun with this one. Sometimes making a sticky mess can be good.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Mixture 1 (in one bowl):</span></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align:center;\">1 \u00bd cups warm water</li>\n<li style=\"text-align:center;\">2 cups Elmer\u2019s Glue</li>\n<li style=\"text-align:center;\">Food coloring</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Mixture 2 (in a second bowl):</span></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align:center;\">3 tsp. Borax</li>\n<li style=\"text-align:center;\">1 cup Warm Water</li>\n<li style=\"text-align:center;\">Stir mixture 1 together in 1 bowl.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Make sure both are mixed well.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Pour mixture 1 into mixture 2.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">There is no need to stir the mixture, just knead as you would dough.<br>\n(Fact: It is the chemical reaction that actually makes the flubber.)<br>\nWhen it is in a \u201cglob\u201d state, work it for 2-3 minutes<br>\nInitially it feels wet but it eventually dries up to the final product.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n</div><p class=\"reblog-source\"><a href=\"http://lantasea.wordpress.com/2013/05/13/flubber/\">View original</a></p></div></div>", "post_id": 996,

First, Ashley wanted to make sure I took a picture of the ramyeon (or ramen) aisle of a Korean grocery store so that you all understand how big ramyeon is in Korea.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1037\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/img_4483.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1037\" title=\"IMG_4483\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/img_4483.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Here&#8217;s the top shelf, where you can get the cup variety.

American ramen comes in flavors like beef, pork, chicken, mushroom, oriental, or creamy chicken. They cost about 20-50 cents a pack, including a small brick of noodles and a single packet of flavoring powder. Korean ramyeon usually comes in flavors based on different dishes, such as guksu (a kind of noodles one might eat in Korea), bibim noodles, yukgaejang (a kind of soup), and so on. Others might be known just for their primary taste, like &#8220;spicy&#8221; or &#8220;mild&#8221; or &#8220;seafood.&#8221; Some of them are very spicy. The cost of ramyeon in Korea is more than ramen in America, but the bricks of noodles are larger and most of them come with two packets, one containing the flavoring powder and one containing dehydrated vegetables or miniature pork meat balls (so we don&#8217;t eat that one).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">___ \u00a0 ___ \u00a0 ___ \u00a0 ___ \u00a0 ___ \u00a0 ___ \u00a0 ___ \u00a0 ___ \u00a0 ___ \u00a0 ___ \u00a0 ___</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/img_4465.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1034\" title=\"IMG_4465\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/img_4465.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a></p>\n<p>A few weeks ago our school had Sports Day. We went to work on Sunday and took Monday off, because the students&#8217; parents had requested Sports Day be on Sunday (Sports Day is an event parents come to watch).

To make things fair, every grade was split into two, so there wasn&#8217;t an issue of older students against younger students. Two teams, each made up of all six grade levels, broke into smaller groups, with each pair of opposing groups going to a different station.

Also no picture because we foreign teachers stood at the finish line and stamped the hands of the students to mark which place they came in. Four students ran at a time, and I had stamp #4. One girl was so upset about getting last in her group that she refused to be stamped. Her mom asked me to stamp her instead so that she could collect the prize for her daughter (4th place got a pencil, while 1st place got four pencils).</p>\n<p>Eventually the day was over and we could go home. We were quite tired by then because it was a bright, hot, sunny day. We had also come in around 6:30 to help set up everything (two foreign teachers didn&#8217;t, though, having chosen instead to come in at the start of the competition and stay after to help dismantle everything). The results were close. I think the final scores of the two teams were about 10 points apart within the higher end of the 900 range. But even though half the students lost, it seemed that they all had fun.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">___ \u00a0 ___ \u00a0 ___ \u00a0 ___ \u00a0 ___ \u00a0 ___ \u00a0 ___ \u00a0 ___ \u00a0 ___ \u00a0 ___ \u00a0 ___</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/img_4582.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1058\" title=\"IMG_4582\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/img_4582.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a></p>\n<p>We went to Seoul the other weekend because Buddha&#8217;s Birthday, a national holiday, was on Monday. Thus we had a three-day weekend. Whenever there&#8217;s a three-day weekend, we don&#8217;t teach Sabbath school, so we went to Seoul to visit Dr. Closser and Dr. Greig, who are in the country for a month, and to meet Kristina, who came back to Korea.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s nothing really new. Last year we also went to Seoul to meet our former professors, and we&#8217;ve also seen Kristina in Korea. We didn&#8217;t meet with the professors until Sunday evening, as they had work on Sunday. So we spent the weekend alone. We took a Sabbath walk in Seoul&#8217;s Children&#8217;s Grand Park (which is much bigger than <a title=\"Baekyangsan &amp; Children's Grand Park\" href=\"http://129degreeseast.wordpress.com/2011/04/24/350/\" target=\"_blank\">Busan&#8217;s Children&#8217;s Grand Park</a>). We had purchased some foods (Korean pears, cherry tomatoes, grapes, bread) when we arrived in Seoul on Friday afternoon, so we enjoyed a little picnic on a bench in one corner of the park.</p>\n<p>There was a zoo in the park, but it closed at a certain time and I forgot all about that while we took our break to eat (and to relax and talk thereafter).

VIPS is a popular Korean restaurant, and we almost went when we were in Busan, but we never got around to it except for one time when there was a long wait. It&#8217;s kind of pricey, but we decided to go this time because did I mention that it weekend was our anniversary in two days? Well, it was, so we went.</p>\n<p>And I would definitely go again. It&#8217;s probably the best buffet I&#8217;ve been to in Korea. It&#8217;s also a steakhouse, so Ashley and I ordered a steak to share. At first, when the steak came out, I was concerned. It looked hardly cooked at all. But then we realized that it was on a stone. It continued to cook, and we could take it off the stone once it reached our desired doneness. At VIPS, there was a section for making pho, or Vietnamese rice noodles. Somehow, I&#8217;ve lived my entire life without eating that. I went back for seconds. You know what else I went back for seconds to get? Salad. If I hadn&#8217;t wanted to eat the pho and some smoked salmon (okay, and some ice cream), I could have eaten nothing but that salad that evening. It was good.</p>\n<p>Finally on Sunday we met our professors. We didn&#8217;t want to show up until we felt safe that they were back from work, so we went to Itaewon, which is probably the most popular place in Korea for foreigners. So popular, in fact, that I felt culture shock when I saw Koreans. I exaggerate, of course, but even the Koreans I saw spoke English. (It often consisted of &#8220;Sir, would you like a custom made suit? Very cheap. No? Take my card.&#8221;) We also ate lunch in Itaewon, where I had a massive cheeseburger. Look at this thing:</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1052\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/img_4549.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1052\" title=\"IMG_4549\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/img_4549.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">It was HEAVY.</p></div>\n<p>Ashley&#8217;s meal was a Mexican omelette, which was also very good, except instead of pinto beans, they used \ud325 (paht) beans. It&#8217;s a Korean red bean that tastes sweet. Not so good for the omelette.</p>\n<p>And we went to a famous English bookstore called What the Book? because Ashley wanted to find a book for the book club she&#8217;s in, and also to find some books to use for her classes.</p>\n<p>Eventually we met with the professors. We talked with them and caught up with what&#8217;s going on with us and with them and the school. And the next day we went with Dr. Closser to meet our friend Kristina (Dr. Greig stayed to do some work before heading downtown later in the day). Oh, did I mention we also met Kristina&#8217;s boyfriend? That was something different about this meet-up.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1057\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/img_4574.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1057\" title=\"IMG_4574\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/img_4574.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Here we are, taking a walk.

I promise.</p>\n<p>This past Wednesday was Korean Memorial Day, so we didn&#8217;t have to go to work. We went to a nearby city called Cheonan. We ate at a Western restaurant, Ashley did some shopping for clothes, and we went to Independence Hall of Korea, which is a very massive museum complex. In the picture above, Ashley is walking toward it from the parking lot where the taxi dropped us off. This broad sidewalk leads to those two pointy columns in the distance.</p>\n<p>&#8230;Then it continues a considerable distance to that building which is also in the background.</p>\n<p>&#8230;And once you pass that building, which is more or less a very stylized gate, you come upon a large courtyard with a semi-circle of buildings before you.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/panorama.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1073\" title=\"panorama\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/panorama.jpg?w=500&#038;h=145\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"145\" /></a></p>\n<p>You go from one building to the next to see the history of Korea (starting in building 1), with an emphasis on the fight for independence during Korea&#8217;s subjugation under various invading forces, especially the most famous and recent invasion, the Japanese occupation of 1910-1945.</p>\n<p>We only had a couple of hours, in order to catch our train back home, so we didn&#8217;t see even half of the buildings. But that&#8217;s okay, because we&#8217;ve already learned so much about the Japanese occupation. Although I must say I was quite impressed with the museums, inside and out.</p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t feel like taking too many pictures at this time, though, so I&#8217;m sorry about that. It was dimly lit in many places, and I wasn&#8217;t sure about flash photography, for one. For another, I wanted just to enjoy the museum. But here are some of the outside:</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1061\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/img_4623.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1061\" title=\"IMG_4623\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/img_4623.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Here is that building which I call a stylized gate.</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_1064\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/img_4634.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1064\" title=\"IMG_4634\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/img_4634.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A ton of Korean flags.

Here&#8217;s one from the inside. It&#8217;s a model of Dokdo, which is a very famous island. Actually it appears to be two islands. Anyway, people outside of Korea or Japan, I think, call them the Liancourt Rocks. In Korea, they are called Dokdo. In Japan, they are called Takeshima. Korea and Japan constantly argue which country these rocks belong to. You can&#8217;t really live on them, but I heard from one Korean that it&#8217;s not only a matter of nationalistic pride, but also because, well, if you own those rocks, you have that much more fishing space.</p></div>\n<p>Well, that&#8217;s all for today. It was quite a bit. I hope that I&#8217;ll post again much sooner next time.</p>\n", "post_id": 1019, "location": false, "date": "06-10-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>(by Brian)</p>\n<p>Dr. Pittman stressed in her seminar about the epic tradition that the genre always strived for telos (or end, to be brief), despite not being able to achieve it even when the poems came to a close. If I have misremembered that information, Dr. Pittman, please forgive me and believe that I forgot nothing else.</p>\n<p>Our orientation with EPIK is over, and in fact, we were told when we signed our contracts that EPIK is finished with us. We are not employed by EPIK. We are employed by our school districts, and EPIK simply got us to that point.</p>\n<p>But getting us to that point was sure a lot of fun and insanity. You\u2019ve probably already read what it took to get us to Korea. That was only half of the intensity. Our first week in Korea was filled with enough study and sleep deprivation to earn ourselves a college degree. They even gave us diplomas:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/img_1658.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-104\" title=\"IMG_1658\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/img_1658.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ashley and I arrived in Korea on the night of Wednesday, February 16. Most people showed up on the standard arrival date of February 17, which was technically the first day of orientation, but the only scheduled events that took place that day were breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I feel bad for the people who got to Pukyong National University at night on Thursday, because Friday morning we had our medical check-up (the Korean government wants to make sure immigrants aren\u2019t users or carriers). And we were told to fast starting 9 PM Thursday night.</p>\n<p>Some people had to show up at the auditorium at 7 AM. Ashley and I were in Class 6, so we arrived at 10:20 in the morning. I guess the people in Class 1 got to break their fast sooner, though. At the auditorium, a medical staff had set up several booths. We had to fill out a medical check list and then go to the various booths to have the medical team fill in the appropriate information. We had a hearing test, two vision tests (one for color and one for distance), a \u201cconsultation\u201d (which consisted of a woman asking us if we had had any diseases or questions), a height-and-weight check, a blood test, a urine test, and a chest X-ray, which was taken in a bus outside the auditorium. Yep. They had a bus outfitted with a chest X-ray machine.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s something you should know about certain buildings in Korea. Many of them are not heated, especially the large parts. Classrooms, yeah. Hallways, no. And it makes sense. No one is supposed to stay in a hallway for very long. So most of us were rather cold while waiting for each station in the auditorium.</p>\n<p>And between classes. We had four days of lectures in our orientation. We had to look at our orientation manual to determine, according to our class number, which room we should be in at any given time of the week. From 9 AM to 10:30 we would have a class. From 10:50 to 12:20 we would have another, and then we would have lunch. Back to class at 2 PM until 3:30, and finally our last ESL training lecture of the day at 3:50 to 5:20. Then it was time for supper, followed at 7:00 by mandatory Korean lessons. The official end time of the lessons was 8:10, but they also lasted an hour and a half. When you consider that the first few days of the orientation were spent also adjusting to the time difference, 8:30 at night was pretty much pass-out time.</p>\n<p>Most of the lecturers did their best to make sure they didn\u2019t add directly to our exhaustion. I found probably 85 to 90% of the information very helpful, despite much of it being geared toward elementary or middle school, while I had indicated a preference for high school. Probably four out of five lectures or lecturers were also highly entertaining. But having six hours of classes a day, not including Korean lessons, was draining.</p>\n<p>We had a break after two days. Half of the people at the orientation got on buses and headed to POSCO, a steel factory in a city about 100 minutes from Busan, to have a tour of the facility and to learn about the industry that helped South Korea\u2019s economy grow. Then they returned to Busan to have lunch at a resort and to watch JUMP, a comedic martial arts show. The other half, my half, took this field trip in reverse. Let me say now that JUMP is one of the best things I\u2019ve seen on stage besides Blue Man Group. But we weren\u2019t allowed to take pictures (for safety purposes with the martial arts choreography), so stop expecting right now.</p>\n<p>The lunch was great (except the caterers assumed we all wanted Western silverware and I\u2019ve grown quite accustomed to the flat metal chopsticks and long spoons of Korea), and the tour at POSCO was painful. Most of the tour was by bus. Each bus was fitted with a representative, who spoke to us, through our bus leaders, about the company as we drove by different parts of the property. Whether something was lost in translation or the representatives just didn\u2019t know the technical terms, I don\u2019t know. What I know is that \u201cstuff\u201d was a very common word. We did get to go inside one building and see (from a very far distance) massive bars of cherry-red steel passing by on rollers and being doused with water to cool them down. Even from a hundred or so feet above the ground, we could feel blasts of heat as the bars rolled by. So seeing (and feeling) that process kind of made up for the bus part of the tour.</p>\n<p>So we were glad for the break from classes, but going to POSCO meant that several hours of our day was spent on buses, so we were still rather tired upon our return to the dormitory.</p>\n<p>Back to classes the next day. And the next. Except on this fourth day of classes, we didn\u2019t have Korean lessons. Because, instead, we had time to work on our lesson plans. There\u2019s something I didn\u2019t tell you yet. All throughout the orientation week, we also had a project to make a lesson plan, with a group of three people, to demonstrate on the final day of orientation. We had to make the lessons for a full class but our demonstrations had to be 15 minutes, so we had to teach the lesson through representative samples of the activities.</p>\n<p>And finally we did the demonstrations and sat through the other demonstrations in our class. Then lunch, followed by going back to the lecture hall (which was a good 10-15 minute walk in the chilly Busan winter air, I should add) to hear the reactions to our lesson plans. Then, meeting the supervisors of our POEs and MOEs (Provincial or Metropolitan Office of Education). Ours, from the Busan Metropolitan City Office of Education, was a funny guy but he simply presented a PowerPoint outlining the major points of our contract.</p>\n<p>The next day, today (as I write this, but not as I post it, as I don\u2019t currently have Internet), we all went to the lecture hall to sign contracts and then meet our co-teachers, who helped us gather our belongings into their cars so they could take us to meet our schools and apartments.</p>\n<p>But that is another adventure.</p>\n", "post_id": 103, "location": false, "date": "02-26-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>It&#8217;s probably not fair, because sudden obligations and changes of plan happen in all lines of work, but Korea is famous among foreign teachers for being a country where such detours are expected. Our colleagues in the public school system are very familiar with scenarios where you expect to teach a class and, five minutes before the class begins, you find out that the class is canceled for whatever reason. I think it even happens on occasion that you wait for your students and after they don&#8217;t arrive for five or ten minutes, someone tells you that the class is canceled.</p>\n<p>Well, that sort of stuff has happened to me both in Busan and in Gwangcheon. It&#8217;s not so obvious here because we\u00a0<em>generally</em> know at least a day in advance, or we&#8217;re told at the beginning of the day that, for example, periods 1, 2, and 3 for grades 2 and 3 are canceled, and periods 1, 2, 3, and 4 for grades 4 through 6 are canceled. So it&#8217;s not quite last minute. A few things, such as the English competitions, have had two- or three-week warnings.</p>\n<p>But in a way, generous advance warnings are worse. If I find out that there will be a harassment lecture for all students during fourth period, and third period just ended, well, that&#8217;s no big deal. I just have to push everyone for that class back a day. And in fact, now I have a free period. Maybe I badly needed the time for class preparations. Or just to take a breath.</p>\n<p>But if we&#8217;re given seven days&#8217; warning, we just know that means there&#8217;s time for the notice to change. On Wednesdays, by the end of the day, we have to put our &#8220;lesson plans&#8221; (usually just page numbers) on the school network for the following week (Monday through Friday, meaning we have to take into account what we expect to do on Thursday and Friday). So of course the sudden changes alter those plans, but so do the longer term notices. We think we know what will happen next week, so that&#8217;s reflected on our plans. Then they make a change.</p>\n<p>We take it in stride, though. I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ve had a normal week since we&#8217;ve been here (we miss classes both because of these sudden changes and because of national holidays or field trips and whatnot). We just say, &#8220;Okay,&#8221; and then push our plans back another day or two.</p>\n<p>But today began a hint of a sinister change. First, the necessary details:</p>\n<p>The final exams are coming up soon. The last day of the semester is July 20, but exams are far before that, so that we can grade the exams and make report cards, and also just because final exams happen about two weeks before the end of the semester in Korea. So two weeks ago it seemed that we were going to have our exams during the first week of July (between July 2 and 6). With that in mind, we were told to have our final exams written by this Friday. Next week, the week before final exams, we planned to review for the exams.</p>\n<p>We have to include our page numbers when we save the exams to the school network. There&#8217;s a separate file that has a table, so each class has its own cell, and we have to input the page numbers relevant to the questions on the test. Well, today we found out that the school now wants our page numbers by tomorrow, Wednesday, two days before the exams are due. This means we might not be done with the exams, but we have to know which page numbers we will use.</p>\n<p>Well, okay, we&#8217;ll just hurry our exams along. Most of our classes were canceled today, after all, due to Korean final exams (that is super early, and yes, we learned of the cancellations this morning). But then the head English teacher and his wife (the Korean intermediary) were talking about what was going to be on the agenda for our weekly Tuesday afternoon meeting. I and another teacher were in the office at that time, and here&#8217;s what we learned: maybe the school was going to push the exams ahead to start next Wednesday rather than the following Monday. The other teacher present, Stephanie, and I were a little upset about this possibility. We had worked out how far we had planned to get in our shared science class (I teach the low level for science grade 6, she the high) and thus how much material to put on the exam. And due to holidays and field trips for the 6th graders and a few other things, we went more than two weeks without seeing that class, only to meet with them once on the third week, rather than three times. That was last Thursday. There was no school on Friday because the students stayed at school all day on Thursday (until 10 pm) for a science day involving star-watching (too bad it was cloudy that night).</p>\n<p>We looked at each other and said, &#8220;Well I guess we have to remove questions from the section on magnets from the exam&#8221; (which we had just made). Because if they move the exams forward, there&#8217;s no way we&#8217;ll get to that section before it&#8217;s time to review for the final. But of course this wasn&#8217;t made official (and in fact our weekly meeting was postponed because the school hadn&#8217;t fully decided yet). And we still have to have our page numbers turned in by tomorrow, so we just have to count on having no time for magnets.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also problematic because we have to feature four quiz scores on the students&#8217; report cards, in addition to the final exam. It works out to be about one quiz per month. Most of us planned on having our last quiz at the end of this month, followed by review for the final, followed by the final. If the exams get pushed forward, it squeezes all of that together. There&#8217;s a possibility that we could give a quiz after the final, but it depends on how soon the school (or the parents) will want the report cards after the exams.</p>\n<p>So it&#8217;s quite crazy at times. I don&#8217;t really mean to complain or to make Korea sound like the Land of Horrible Schedules, because I&#8217;m sure teachers across the world deal with these issues. I just want to let you know just a bit more about what&#8217;s going on in our lives. This post just happens to be about one of the less glamorous aspects of our job. In a way, though, it&#8217;s kind of exciting. I did feel rather productive today.</p>\n", "post_id": 1079, "location": false, "date": "06-19-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>This will be just a quick update to keep the blog alive.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s raining here. Quite a bit. One of my coworkers, the one married to a Korean, said Korea was having its most severe drought in over a hundred years. That was less than two weeks ago. Within days we had a good rain. And we&#8217;ve had a few even better rains since. And this morning I woke up to probably the best rain ever. Any better and it probably would have been bad. I liked hearing the sound of it.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re working on grades now. Today the final exam grades are due. We have to have them entered on the network, but they already are there. We graded the tests quickly and even showed the results to the students. But now we have to make their report cards, which are due by 4:30 on Wednesday. It&#8217;s quite a bit of work, and I think it&#8217;s not much fun. For each class, we have thirteen total boxes of input. One box is for the exam. Another is for the combined scores of 4 quizzes throughout the semester. Ten more are for individual assessment criteria, things like &#8220;Can distinguish phonic sounds&#8221; for conversation class, and &#8220;Can explain weather and the seasons&#8221; for science. Finally we have one more box. We have to write three sentences for each student. Things like &#8220;She is a kind, friendly student,&#8221; &#8220;He has greatly improved his English speaking skills,&#8221; or &#8220;Demonstrates a need for improved social skills.&#8221; Nothing too negative, of course.</p>\n<p>Anyway, so far I have input the 12 letter boxes for four of my six classes (the exam and quiz grades and the 10 individual assessment points are given letters, ranging from NI for Needs Improvement to E for Excellent). I haven&#8217;t yet made any of the full sentence comments in the last box. I&#8217;m not looking forward to it.</p>\n<p>But who knows? Maybe, for some of the students (which does not necessarily mean either good or bad students), it will be fun. And after all, when they&#8217;re finished on Wednesday, we have seven more days of work. For three of those days, the 4th, 5th, and 6th graders will be on a field trip (Monday through Wednesday of the week after next). We have full classes on Thursday and then on Friday, from what I hear, we might not have any classes to teach.</p>\n<p>Then it&#8217;ll be time to go home for a couple weeks.</p>\n", "post_id": 1083, "location": false, "date": "07-06-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p><span style=\"color:#008000;\"><a title=\"Korean\"><span style=\"color:#008000;\">\ub05d</span></a>. <a title=\"Spanish\"><span style=\"color:#008000;\">Fin</span></a>. <a title=\"English\"><span style=\"color:#008000;\">End</span></a>.</span></p>\n<p>Not yet. No, we have seven work days remaining. But effectively, it&#8217;s the end. It&#8217;s as if I had been dropped into the middle of Lake Michigan, and I had to make it back to the shoreline. And I&#8217;m not there yet, but I&#8217;ve finally reached to where I can stand. I don&#8217;t have to swim any longer. The beach is but a few steps away.</p>\n<p>And after all of that paddling, walking feels a bit weird. I mentioned earlier that we had to <a title=\"Rain &amp; Grades\" href=\"http://129degreeseast.wordpress.com/2012/07/06/rain-grades/\" target=\"_blank\">make report cards</a>. Before that we had to make report card templates, including writing ten performance comments for each of a few classes, to which we assigned letter grades, such as E for Excellent and VG for Very Good. Before that, we had to grade final exams. Before that, we had to make the final exams. And of course, some of these tasks involved various steps and approvals.</p>\n<p>I haven&#8217;t gone too much into my schedule, like <a title=\"Ashley's Weekly Schedule\" href=\"http://129degreeseast.wordpress.com/2012/04/27/ashleys-weekly-schedule/\" target=\"_blank\">Ashley has</a>, but I&#8217;ll tell you a few details: The first half of the week is heavily weighted. I have four classes Monday, five Tuesday, and six Wednesday. On Monday we receive the students&#8217; English diaries, and we&#8217;re expected to return them by Wednesday morning. So we usually spend an hour or two extra on Monday and/or Tuesday working on those. On Wednesday, before we leave work, we&#8217;re supposed to fill in our weekly plans for the following work week (it&#8217;s usually only a matter of filling in the appropriate page numbers, but sometimes it&#8217;s more complicated than that).</p>\n<p>As I mentioned, our report cards are due today. That means we had extra work for the past week, and inevitably much of it in the last three days. I stayed an hour after quitting time yesterday to ensure that I&#8217;d be done with enough of my report cards so as not to worry about completing them by 4:30 today, considering that today, Wednesday, is my heaviest day, and that I&#8217;d only have a few hours of office time.</p>\n<p>Well, I finished those report cards maybe between 2:00 and 2:20. My &#8220;after school program&#8221; (ASP) class is at 2:40. I set to work on filling out next week&#8217;s weekly plans. Our head teacher had also told us today that we should fill out not only next week&#8217;s plans, but the weekly plans for when the second semester starts, the week of August 20-24. So after my ASP finished, I came back to tackle that week&#8217;s plans as well.</p>\n<p>It was when that was done that I stood up and stopped kicking my legs, thrashing my arms about the waves. After all that effort, and then I didn&#8217;t know what to do. Thursday is already an easy day (four classes in the morning, lunch, then three hours of break before a 3:30 ASP). But the fourth graders are going on a field trip tomorrow. That knocks out 1st and 4th period.</p>\n<p>We get off work at 2:30 on Friday (no ASP). Next week, the 4th-6th graders will be on a field trip Monday-Wednesday. It&#8217;s likely that Friday will involve canceled classes for school cleaning or a ceremony or whatnot.</p>\n<p>Those last few steps to the beach should be pleasant. The waves are calm. The water is clear. There are no sharp rocks to cut my feet. I can take it easy. And when I get there, that beach will lead me to America.</p>\n", "post_id": 1086, "location": false, "date": "07-11-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>Last week we went for a walk after church with one of the new teachers at our school, who came in late August to replace a teacher who moved back to America at the end of the semester. We ended up walking to Oseosan (\uc624\uc11c\uc0b0), the nearest mountain. It took an hour to walk there, and it was a hot day. We decided to walk up it, but only to a familiar resting spot about 30 minutes uphill. It felt good to get out for a change and get some exercise, so we decided that we should make a weekly habit of going for a long Sabbath walk.</p>\n<p>Today, it was a very, very long walk.</p>\n<p>We hiked to the top of the mountain.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_4650.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image aligncenter\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_4650.jpg?w=649&#038;h=486\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"649\" height=\"486\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Today was not so hot. There were clouds, and the breeze was pleasant. I carried a 2-liter bottle of water with me. Our friend Linda made some \uae40\ubc25 (kimbap), which is rice and vegetables (or meat sometimes) rolled in a layer of roasted seaweed. We planned to eat that \uae40\ubc25 at the top of the mountain, or as high as we dared go. Linda had never been to the top of a mountain before, and we haven&#8217;t reached a summit since leaving Busan, so we kept saying to each other, &#8220;Well, let&#8217;s see how far we get today.&#8221; Wherever we would stop,\u00a0<em>that</em> would be the top. That would be where we&#8217;d eat the kimbap that Linda made and the \uc57d\uacfc (yakgua, a kind of traditional Korean cookie) that I brought.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">We decided to climb slowly and steadily, like the victorious tortoise. We didn&#8217;t want to hurt ourselves early on and end up quitting.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_4661.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_4661.jpg?w=649&#038;h=486\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"649\" height=\"486\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\u00a0At one point, we reached some stairs. You&#8217;d think, &#8220;Oh yay, stairs!&#8221; but you&#8217;d be wrong. Unless the terrain is slippery, stairs seem to make us tired quicker. I think it&#8217;s because the rise and run of your pacing is set for you, rather than something you can choose yourself. Anyway, there were a ton of these. I liked how the trees popped straight up through the steps, though.</p>\n<p><div style=\"width: 588px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_4656.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image \" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_4656.jpg?w=578&#038;h=435\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"578\" height=\"435\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Here&#8217;s part of our view about halfway up the mountain.

We knew from the map near the bottom that there would be 13 markers until we got to what would be relatively close to the peak. We thought we&#8217;d at least go to the marker, if not the peak.\u00a0</p>\n<p><div style=\"width: 740px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_4670.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image  \" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_4670.jpg?w=730&#038;h=547\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"730\" height=\"547\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Almost to 13!</p></div>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">When we passed these bushes, we saw the top. It didn&#8217;t look far, so I convinced Ashley and Linda that we should try to make it. We passed 13 on the way (we had wondered where that marker was at, as it was spaced a bit farther than the normal interval). So it turned out I was right.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Or was I?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">We made it to the top.\u00a0</p>\n<p><div style=\"width: 740px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_4674.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image  \" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_4674.jpg?w=730&#038;h=547\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"730\" height=\"547\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">791 meters above sea level, according to that rock.</p></div>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_4677.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image aligncenter\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_4677.jpg?w=714&#038;h=535\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"714\" height=\"535\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">It was amazing. Linda, of course, had every reason to be stinkin&#8217; proud. For one, that was her first time all the way to the top of a mountain. For two, we climbed all the way to the top of a mountain, so we might have been a bit stinky. We went over to a large wooden platform and looked out on the view in the above picture. We were going to eat that well deserved kimbap.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Suddenly we heard a Korean man exclaim, &#8220;Kimbap!&#8221; so Linda offered him a piece. His friend just ran right over to us so he could have a piece, too. He had a big grin. I think he really likes kimbap, because he ate about three or four pieces. When they came, I said to them, \uadf8\ub140\uac00 \uadf8\uac70 \ub9cc\ub4e4\uc5c8\uc5b4\uc694. &#8220;She made that.&#8221; So they were very impressed that a foreigner made kimbap that tasted so good. They kept saying, &#8220;Made in USA!&#8221; Because Linda shared her kimbap with them, they brought their camping stove over (by the way, some people had set up tents on top of the mountain on this large wooden platform, which seems like a rather fun idea) and shared some ramyeon and an apple with us. It was nice to have an impromptu, friendly picnic with strangers, even though we could barely speak one another&#8217;s languages. Maybe that made it even more fun.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">When the picnic was finished, we walked back down the mountain. It was already close to six o&#8217;clock, and I thought it would take about an hour to go down, perhaps a bit more. It would be a little dark once we reached the bottom. We made a mistake, however. On the way up, we had seen a sign that pointed another way down the mountain to the temple that is somewhat near the bottom. It said the distance was shorter, and we contemplated taking that route on the way back. The stairs were much easier to go down than up, though, so we almost didn&#8217;t take that different route. We saw some Koreans taking that route though, so it increased our confidence that this would be a good path to try.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Well, it wasn&#8217;t. We really should have taken the stairs. The path was a bit steeper, had no stairs, and was full of sticks and leaves and rocks. We had to go down much slower. We found some sturdy sticks and used them to guide us and to help us keep our footing. For inexperienced Linda, though, it was of little help. She slipped a few times and at one point even hurt her wrist from landing on it. Thankfully, it wasn&#8217;t broken.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The path was also a bad choice because, unlike the stairs which were on the edge of the forest cover, this new path was right in the middle, which meant that the approaching sunset was approaching all the faster. So we had to take it easy so we wouldn&#8217;t fall, but we also had to go fast enough not to be caught in the middle of a mountain forest in pitch black. Eventually we had to use our cell phones for light. Relatively soon after that, we made it to where we were no longer under so many trees. The moon was our friend. So were the streetlights and homes we were approaching.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">So we learned some valuable lessons today. One is to bring a flashlight on all future hikes. Even if we only plan to go on a three-hour trek starting at 8:00 am. The second is to choose the stairs for the descent. The third is to bring extra kimbap.</p>\n", "post_id": 1089, "location": false, "date": "09-29-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>(by Ashley)</p>\n<p>I have to \u00a0say, our apartment building is not in an ideal location. Tonight Brian and I wanted to go to Seomyeon and look around. Seomyeon metro station is right below an underground mall and Lotte department store/hotel. So we went to Seomyeon ate some street food, which was delicious, but probably overpriced, and I even did a little shopping in the underground mall. It was a nice outing, but the commute was not so nice. \u00a0Since our apartment is in the boonies and we don&#8217;t yet understand the bus system, it took us 30 minutes to walk down the gently sloping street to the metro station to take the train to Seomyeon, and it took 10 minutes from Dong-Eui University station to Seomyeon. Forty minutes one way. Since our apartment happens to be up the side of a mountain, on the way back we were quite unhappy to be \u00a0walking uphill for half an \u00a0hour.</p>\n<p>Apart from our location in the boondocks, our apartment does seem to need some TLC. The previous tenant did not clean, so there are things to be done. The apartment is also not very shiny and new&#8211;some newer apartments have automatic locks and cool gadgets, but not ours&#8211;and the outside looks a bit run-down, but from the first moment I stepped inside, I saw the potential. The apartment is small, but much bigger than I expected, and it will be cozy once everything gets all put in place. Right now all of our luggage and clothes are still all over and there are things from the previous person that need to be thrown away. Yikes.</p>\n<p>Anyway, we actually have a &#8220;two&#8221; bedroom place with a small room I assume could fit a tiny bed. Right now it just has our wardrobe and a few left-over things. \u00a0Next to the kitchen there is also what I tend to refer to as the yucky room. It&#8217;s an unheated room with tiled walls and floors that smells weird and seems made to get wet. Many Korean apartments I&#8217;ve seen on Youtube have rooms like this, but I don&#8217;t know what they are for. I guess the previous tenants used it as a storage space for the Christmas tree. \u00a0And so will we.</p>\n<p class=\"jetpack-slideshow-noscript robots-nocontent\">This slideshow requires JavaScript.</p><div id=\"gallery-109-2-slideshow\" class=\"slideshow-window jetpack-slideshow slideshow-black\" data-width=\"984\" data-height=\"410\" data-trans=\"fade\" data-gallery=\"[{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com\\/2011\\/02\\/door-in-the-kitchen-to-yucky-room.jpg&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;111&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;Door in the kitchen to yucky room.&quot;},{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com\\/2011\\/02\\/doors-to-the-room.jpg&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;112&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;Doors into our room.

Also, this post mostly deals with everything that <em>led up to</em> being in Korea.]</p>\n<p>I\u2019m listening to cars driving on the highway. If I had grown up in a city, I would say that I feel like I\u2019m home. From where I sit, on a dormitory bed, I can see apartment buildings, trees, and cars driving on the right side of the highway. There\u2019s a bridge near the sea that fades into the morning fog.</p>\n<p>But I\u2019m not at home. I\u2019m in the dormitory of the Daeyeon Campus of Pukyong National University in Busan, South Korea, and a dorm room is hardly home to a full-time student, much less to someone who will only stay there for a week. But in eight or nine days, Ashley and I will move into an apartment, and I will call it home.</p>\n<p>We got to the university around eleven last night. For those of you in America, that\u2019s somewhere between six and nine in the morning, depending on your time zone. The journey was long. We started traveling before five in the morning and arrived at the dorm 28 hours and 14 time zones later. But the journey started two years ago. Ashley and I found out about EPIK (the English Program in Korea) when Isaac Lee handed us a flyer advertising the program at the Andrews University International Food Fair. We had been engaged for a month or two. We didn\u2019t have any plans. And we both liked the idea.</p>\n<p>We didn\u2019t decide on Korea right away. We thought about jobs we could get in the States and places to live. Ashley briefly considered becoming a registered dietician, and I thought about getting a PhD or getting a job in some company\u2019s shipping and receiving department to make ends meet for a few years before resigning myself to the glamorous life of an adjunct composition instructor. Ashley could never stay away from her true calling in English, though, and she has enjoyed tutoring Korean students via webcam over the last few years. Me, I just really want to eat Korean food.</p>\n<p>I have some right now. Well, it\u2019s a beverage, but it\u2019s Korean. It\u2019s the first thing other than water that I\u2019ve consumed since my arrival in Korea, and I think it\u2019s called \uc794\uce58\uc9d1 \uc2dd\ud61c (janchijip sikhye). It\u2019s a rice beverage I got from a vending machine for 600 won (54 cents), and it tastes pretty good. I even get a grain of rice to chew on sometimes, which is good, because it\u2019s serving as my breakfast. Ashley and I were too tired and lazy to make it to the cafeteria on time.</p>\n<p>So what kind of journey has it been? For the sake of brevity (if that\u2019s possible) and because of my body\u2019s demand for rest, I\u2019ll give you a list of what we have had to do to make it here.

As long as our flight was (the longest was 13 hours), it wasn\u2019t that bad. We had two meals, a mid-flight snack, and there were four movies on. I also had my iPod and some books to read. And I slept some.</p>\n<p>Meeting people in Tokyo was strange. Ashley and I were headed toward our gate and passed a coffee shop when I heard someone say, \u201cBrian?\u201d I knew that not many of the Japanese people walking in our same general direction would be named Brian, and I also knew that Kyle was going to be looking for us.</p>\n<p>So I turned. Kyle wears a hoodie on Facebook, but I could still tell it was him. \u201cKyle?\u201d Yep. A fellow EPIKer, Zach, was getting coffee and we all decided to stick together. After we moved to our gate, a couple more people showed up. Jason and Zach went for a smoke and a girl named Rachel came up to Kyle and asked if we were all teaching for EPIK, prefacing her question by saying that she wouldn\u2019t normally walk up to a stranger and ask them why they\u2019re on a certain flight. A later revelation told us why she had seemed a bit apologetic in approaching us: she didn\u2019t know about the Facebook group. She just saw a few non-Japanese people sitting at her gate and wondered if we were like her, if we were EPIK teachers.</p>\n<p>And we were. We are.</p>\n", "post_id": 11, "location": false, "date": "02-17-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>One of Korea&#8217;s two most important holidays happened this weekend. Chuseok (\ucd94\uc11d) is considered Korea&#8217;s version of Thanksgiving. Unlike American Thanksgiving, it is determined according to the lunar calendar, not the solar calendar. This year, Chuseok fell on September 30, a Sunday. The day before and the day after Chuseok are national holidays, so we had Monday off from work. Today, Wednesday, is another public holiday, Foundation Day. So most schools gave their students and teachers Tuesday off as well.</p>\n<p>We took advantage of the five-day weekend to visit our first hometown outside of America: Busan. We left on Sunday morning around 7:30, taking a train to Cheonan, where we arrived an hour later and waited about 50 minutes for our four-hour train to Busan. (You can see why we don&#8217;t often go to Busan.)</p>\n<p><div style=\"width: 451px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/2012-09-30-14-43-481.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image \" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/2012-09-30-14-43-481.jpg?w=441&#038;h=330\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"441\" height=\"330\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Outside of Busan Station</p></div>\n<p>We arrived after 1:30 in the afternoon. To pass the time until we could check in at our hotel (3 pm), we put our carry-on suitcase in a locker and ate lunch at Lotteria. It sounds like a place to buy a lottery ticket, but it&#8217;s the Korean equivalent of McDonald&#8217;s, and its name comes from Lotte, which is one of the big companies in Korea. We tried their food a few times in the past, but we always hated it. Their beef hamburgers were tasteless. However, someone once told me that their chicken burgers were pretty good, and I&#8217;ve discovered that that is true. So I ordered the <a title=\"Hot Crispy Burger\" href=\"http://www.lotteria.com/eng/menu/Menu_View.asp?Idx=99&amp;C1=3&amp;C2=8&amp;C3=\" target=\"_blank\">Hot Crispy Burger</a> set, while Ashley hoped that a <a title=\"Hanwoo Bulgogi Burger\" href=\"http://www.lotteria.com/eng/menu/Menu_View.asp?Idx=81&amp;C1=3&amp;C2=8&amp;C3=\" target=\"_blank\">Hanwoo Bulgogi Burger</a>, made with traditional Korean beef, would be better than the normal beef patties featured at Lotteria. It was probably made with the cheapest grade of hanu (also spelled hanwoo, even though there&#8217;s no &#8216;W&#8217; sound in that word whatsoever; same goes with Daewoo), because Ashley said it wasn&#8217;t all that impressive.</p>\n<p>Our hotel, E Fashion Hotel in Choryang, was one small block away from Choryang Station, which is one stop from Busan Station, so after we ate, it wasn&#8217;t long until we arrived at our hotel. We checked in and then promptly did nothing for a few hours. After six hours of travel, and probably not the most nutritiously energizing of lunches, we just wanted to lie down and watch TV (it seems we watch significantly more television on vacation than we do in our everyday lives, since we have turned on the television in our apartment probably two times since we moved in).<em><br /></em></p>\n<p>We managed to find a good show, despite not understanding Korean. In my students&#8217; weekly English diaries, I read that many of them like a show called Running Man. That&#8217;s the show we watched. In this episode, a group of about a dozen people were in a room inside what appeared to be a factory for making subway trains. One by one, each person left the room to go hide somewhere in the facility. They wore T-shirts with their team&#8217;s color, and on their backs were tags with their names on them. The goal seemed to be the last person (or team) standing, meaning that no one from another team has removed your name tag.</p>\n<p>Eventually we got hungry again, and headed downtown. We went to Emilia, a buffet. We went there once before, but it was a bit different this time. The weekend price was covered up to match the weekday dinner price, so I&#8217;m guessing that the restaurant is trying to encourage more customers to come. After we ate, we took a brief walk through Jagalchi, the famous fish market of Busan. I expected many of the fish stands to be closed (and they were, either because it was Chuseok or because it was after 9 pm), but I didn&#8217;t expect the fish eateries to be opened. Many of them were, and we saw dozens and dozens of Koreans eating at these holes in the wall.</p>\n<p>After this, we went to find a cab to take us back to our hotel. Sure, we could have taken the subway, but the distance was not far, so the price was barely more than the cost of two people on the metro. In addition, Ashley&#8217;s legs were still extremely sore from Saturday&#8217;s adventure on Oseosan, especially when walking up or down stairs. It took some time, though. We stood in one spot where we saw a couple successfully hail a cab. We saw an old man with a can stand along the road before us, waiting for a taxi to pick him up. One cab almost stopped for him but kept going once the driver got close to see that it was an old man with a cane. So we didn&#8217;t want that cab to stop for us, not if the driver wouldn&#8217;t pick up a poor old man. But eventually we got back to our hotel.</p>\n<p>The next day our friends Brian and Kathleen contacted us to meet for lunch at a Thai restaurant in Nampo-dong. So we met them and went to Arun Thai, which is a very good restaurant. Check out our food:</p>\n<p><div style=\"width: 451px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/2012-10-01-14-00-26.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image \" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/2012-10-01-14-00-26.jpg?w=441&#038;h=330\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"441\" height=\"330\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The chicken pad thai I ordered.

We each ate a cupcake (much thanks to Brian and Kathleen, who paid). Ashley got the dark chocolate cupcake, while I ordered the namesake cupcake. Ashley liked mine better.</p>\n<p><div style=\"width: 451px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/2012-10-01-16-07-39.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image \" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/2012-10-01-16-07-39.jpg?w=441&#038;h=330\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"441\" height=\"330\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">I meant to take a picture of the shop once we left, but I forgot. All I got is this picture of the design along the upper wall from where I was sitting.</p></div>\n<p>For dinner, we met Mr. Jung, one of the English teachers from Jurye Girls&#8217; High School, where I worked last year when we lived in Busan. We went with Mr. Jung to T.G.I.Friday&#8217;s, and he said that as guests in his hometown, he would treat us. Of course, he also said that Busan is like our hometown too. I affirmed that indeed, it is our first hometown outside of our home country.</p>\n<p>Mr. Jung said that the students at Jurye miss me. I asked how the new native teacher was doing, but he said that the students don&#8217;t like her as much because she&#8217;s too strict. I thought out loud, Well at least I hope she is a better teacher and that the students are learning more from her, but Mr. Jung said he wasn&#8217;t sure. He doesn&#8217;t teach with her. I guess the new teacher teaches mostly with Mr. Lee (the head English teacher) and Ms. Park, unlike my situation from last year, when I had five co-teachers.</p>\n<p>We discussed various other things, including his family situation. He became a father a few months before we left Busan, and I guess he and his wife are now on their way to being parents doubly. He also said that they plan to visit America after a few years, so they will stop by and meet us. I caused him a moment of confusion by saying, &#8220;Well, then, you are welcome,&#8221; because he at first wondered what he had thanked me for.</p>\n<p>The next day, Tuesday, we met Mr. Lee at his apartment for lunch. He was very happy to see us. He said that I looked skinnier and that Ashley looked prettier. Mr. Jung had only met Ashley briefly once at our co-worker&#8217;s wedding, so he couldn&#8217;t comment on whether she was prettier now, but he had also made the remark that I looked skinnier. I don&#8217;t feel skinnier but I appreciated the compliment. Normally, if we visit Mr. Lee, his wife and mother-in-law are home. This time, however, only he and his own mother were there. His mother prepared us a wonderful lunch, although she kept telling her son to apologize to us that it was not so delicious since Mr. Lee&#8217;s wife wasn&#8217;t the one who made the food. I don&#8217;t know, though, because it certainly was delicious.</p>\n<p><div style=\"width: 451px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/2012-10-02-12-47-36.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image \" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/2012-10-02-12-47-36.jpg?w=441&#038;h=330\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"441\" height=\"330\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">\ub9e4\uc6b0 \ub9db\uc788\uc5c8\uc5b4\uc694! (It was very delicious!)</p></div>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">While we were eating the food, I asked Mr. Lee if the new native teacher eats Korean food well, but he said never. She doesn&#8217;t like Korean food at all. She started out by eating a bit of rice and soup for lunch at school, but now she brings her own lunch. Some people just don&#8217;t like Korean food much, and I guess I&#8217;ve finally now heard of someone who doesn&#8217;t.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Mr. Lee showed me the school newspaper that he and some of the English teachers and students put together. It looked very nice, and he gave a copy for me to keep. Ashley and I looked through the newspaper, which looks a bit more like a magazine actually, and we were very impressed. I told Mr. Lee to tell the students I am proud of them. After lunch, we had a dessert of apple and Korean pear slices and traditional Korean snacks. Ashley told Mr. Lee how much she likes Korean pears, so when we left his house, he gave Ashley a bag of four large Korean pears, plus an apple! (To buy a single Korean pear at the store costs around 3500 to 4000\uc6d0, or $3.15 to $3.60.) Mr. Lee walked with us to the bus stop, where we took a couple of pictures and said goodbye.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/2012-10-02-14-39-171.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image aligncenter\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/2012-10-02-14-39-171.jpg?w=441&#038;h=330\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"441\" height=\"330\" /></a><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/2012-10-02-14-39-391.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image aligncenter\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/2012-10-02-14-39-391.jpg?w=441&#038;h=330\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"441\" height=\"330\" /></a>Finally, we met Brian and Kathleen once more in Nampo-dong. This time we went to try a new Indian restaurant. The name of the restaurant is &#8220;New Little Indian Restaurant,&#8221; or something like that. The menu looked fantastic and it was hard for me to choose what to get, but eventually I settled for Tandoori Lamb. It turned out that all of us chose some sort of lamb dish. Unfortunately, the waitress misremembered our order (she was Indian and spoke perfect English, so it wasn&#8217;t a language thing) and came out with chicken vindaloo for Brian instead of lamb vindaloo, and chicken dopiazza for Kathleen or Ashley (they both ordered the same thing) instead of lamb dopiazza. When she took it back to the kitchen, we saw the chefs yelling at her, so we felt kind of bad. Brian and Kathleen said they&#8217;d give the place another shot before writing it off. But as for me, the tandoori lamb was wicked delicious. During our dinner, we had an interesting conversation about Brian, because the waitress said that he looked like a movie star. He wondered which one. I guess lots of people tell him Morris Chestnut, although he doesn&#8217;t seem to agree. Finally she said Forrest Whitaker, although he looks almost nothing like Brian. I think Brian disagreed more with that than with Morris Chestnut.</p>\n<p><div style=\"width: 375px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/534374_3656724142620_1210217386_n.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image \" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/534374_3656724142620_1210217386_n.jpg?w=365&#038;h=365\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"365\" height=\"365\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">This is Brian.</p></div>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Our last outing in Busan was to Baskin Robbins. We had chosen Red Velvet between the two on Monday, so we went here after supper on Tuesday. I planned on buying this round as Brian paid for the cupcakes, but he snuck in and paid while I wasn&#8217;t looking. That jerk.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">After ice cream, we went to the subway station and parted ways. We had an early trip ahead of us. Train tickets for Chuseok weekend sold fast, so that the latest train out of Busan we could get was at six in the morning. We woke up, got ready, and went to Busan Station to board our train. Luckily, this time we rode the KTX to Cheonan-Asan station, so that leg of the journey was only two hours rather than four. We slept most of the way back to Gwangcheon. And also once we got back to our apartment around 10 am. We were quite tired. And now I am tired once more. In fact, it&#8217;s time to sleep. Good night.</p>\n", "post_id": 1119, "location": false, "date": "10-03-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>A few (okay, maybe several) weeks ago our school went on a field trip. Where did we go? We went to EVERLAND! Everland is a famous amusement park in Korea. We knew about it for about two weeks in advance, which is quite a generous notice in Korea. Therefore we feared every day that someone would come and tell us, Oh, nevermind, we&#8217;re not going to go to Everland after all.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Ashley was not feeling well on the particular day we decided to go. She told me to go and have fun anyway, and when I arrived outside of the school and told my co-workers that Ashley was sitting this one out, they said all the more reason to scope out the good parts this time and to go again. I also found out that Brad, the head English teacher, was skipping out because his back was bothering him.</p>\n<p>So we went. There were to be two foreign teachers on each bus, Ashley and I on a bus with the second graders, but now I was the only one. I saw down toward the back near some students. I don&#8217;t teach many of the second graders, but I was near some of those I do teach. Two girls, whose English names are Sarah and Alyssa, talked with me the whole way. They are so cute and funny. On the way back to school, Sarah sat with someone else and Alyssa insisted that I sit next to her. She taught me how to play \ubb35 \ucc0c \ube60, which is like \uac00\uc704\ubc14\uc704\ubcf4 (scissors rock paper), but with some added rules. And some other students, ones I teach and ones I don&#8217;t, kept giving me chocolate and snacks. Korean students sure know how to share.</p>\n<p>About two hours later we arrived at Everland. One foreign teacher got lassoed into helping watch the lower level students who didn&#8217;t want to ride on any rides, so we didn&#8217;t hang out with her (but she, having plans to be in the area the next day, stayed to have some fun after we left, which was merely four hours after arriving\u2014it was a Friday, though I imagine any other day of the week also would have resulted in an &#8220;early&#8221; departure, this being an elementary school field trip and all). That left Linda, Alex, and me. We wandered a bit to decide what to do. We quickly thought, T-Express (the world&#8217;s steepest wooden roller coaster). We made our way to the T-Express and immediately decided No. Once we saw the woman with the sign that read &#8220;180\ubd84,&#8221; we turned around. Three hours is quite a long wait.</p>\n<p>But that&#8217;s how it was there. We rode one roller coaster, the Rolling X-Train, and we waited about 90 minutes. The ride lasted perhaps 45-60 seconds. It was fun, but as Alex theorized, there just aren&#8217;t enough roller coasters at Everland to accommodate all the people that were there that day. (We don&#8217;t know if the crowd was a normal size or not, since Korea is crowded, but on the other hand we saw more school uniforms than casual clothing, suggesting that every school in Korea had the same idea for a field trip on the same day.) One large attraction was even shut down that day for whatever reason.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/2012-10-19-12-06-08.jpg\"><img id=\"i-1154\" class=\"size-full wp-image aligncenter\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/2012-10-19-12-06-08.jpg?w=580&#038;h=435\" height=\"435\" width=\"580\" /></a></p>\n<p>Every time we saw some of our students, we asked them, &#8220;How many rides did you ride?&#8221; &#8220;One,&#8221; they would say, or even, &#8220;Not yet.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I edit and comment on the weekly English diaries for the fourth grade students. When we came back to school the next week, I read Herald&#8217;s diary, wherein he said that he rode the T-Express, bumper cars, and three or four rides I can&#8217;t remember. I thought, &#8220;How did he have the time?&#8221; It turns out he bought an express pass for those rides which have them (T-Express being one of them). We should have thought of that.</p>\n<p>But Everland is quite nice. We didn&#8217;t see everything, but we might go back (and buy express passes, if we do end up taking the effort to go there again). When we only had a short time left before the departure, we discovered the Four Seasons Garden area. Quite beautiful.</p>\n<p><div style=\"width: 590px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/2012-10-19-14-01-56.jpg\"><img id=\"i-1155\" class=\" wp-image \" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/2012-10-19-14-01-56.jpg?w=580&#038;h=435\" height=\"435\" width=\"580\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">And playful.</p></div>\n<p>Anyway, I can&#8217;t complain.

It&#8217;s midnight right now as I begin to type this. This (I hope) will be a quick post, because I need to get to sleep.</p>\n<p>About ten days ago we finally learned when the final exams will be for English classes at our school. The 26th through 28th of November. About a full week or two earlier than our head teacher had expected based on his three years here. We were given until the 16th to turn in the first draft of our exams for review, which is today (it&#8217;s 12:04 AM at the moment of this sentence). We were all rather shocked. I think you can guess that we&#8217;ve been busy.</p>\n<p>We also have to have four quizzes for each class, which have to be finished in time to put the grades on the students&#8217; report cards (which I imagine will be due at least a week before the last day of the semester). Most people have two or three quizzes given for each class so far. So some of us have also worked to squeeze in quiz number three or four before the time for exams. Some classes will need to have a quiz after final exams (which is not an entirely new thing &#8211; due to odd schedule changes last semester, Stephanie and I had to give quiz number four to the sixth grade science classes after summer finals). I already had three quizzes in most classes, so I didn&#8217;t need to rush as much as a few other people, but I wanted to get through quiz number four anyway, just in case of sudden and probable class cancellations or if I end up deciding to give a fifth quiz (which is an opportunity for the students to have the lowest quiz score dropped). So I guess I should say I kind of brought this (some of it) on myself.</p>\n<p>So with all of the exam-writing, quiz-writing, quiz-grading, and various other things going on at school, we&#8217;ve all been putting in some really packed days. Which is good. I feel very productive and not at all like I&#8217;m deadweight at work. Though if I had a day or two like that next week, I wouldn&#8217;t mind! (I know that we English teachers in Korea don&#8217;t have quite the work load that Korean teachers have, so I wonder what kind of mess they have to deal with around this time!)</p>\n<p>Ashley and I stayed late at work three days this week. Almost two hours on Tuesday and Wednesday, and a full two hours today. When we left the English teachers&#8217; office, the hallway was nearly pitch black, and only a few Korean teachers remained on the other side of the building. On Tuesday and Thursday we came home, made supper, and did more work, which we had brought home. (I just finished Thursday&#8217;s work before beginning this post.) The only reason we didn&#8217;t bring work home Wednesday was because we had a plan to go to our co-worker&#8217;s apartment for FAJITAS. With REAL PINTO BEANS. It was amazing and a much-needed break. Thank you, Linda.</p>\n<p>Well, I realize that that was a rather abrupt change in tone and topic, but as I said, it&#8217;s late and I should go to bed. I just thought I&#8217;d share what we&#8217;ve been up to lately (and to receive a cathartic effect from writing this recent activity).</p>\n", "post_id": 1158, "location": false, "date": "11-15-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>The first snow came. It came on Wednesday. It came with lightning. It came with thunder.</p>\n<p>Before, there was no snow. In fact, even last winter there was no snow, because we lived in Busan. Busan has milder weather. I guess there is a bit of snow there now, but last year there was but a scattering of flakes that I observed on the way to the grocery store one day. Not one flake stuck. Ashley thinks I made it up. We saw snow on Jeju Island in January, because the bus from one side of the island to the other crossed the mountain. Once we had finished crossing, there was little snow.</p>\n<p>So the last time I really spent considerable time in a snowy land was when I lived in Michigan at the beginning of 2011. I have not lived in snow since moving to Korea. Yet now I wake up, walk outside to go to work, and my feet are in snow. The trees are covered with snow. The students are playing with the snow. And I think it&#8217;s here to stay. So I imagine I&#8217;ll see it every day until spring. But I&#8217;m not sure. I don&#8217;t know if the snow in Gwangcheon remains or if it comes in doses. I guess I&#8217;ll find out.</p>\n<p>That first snow on Wednesday was something called thundersnow. On Wednesday evening, we (foreign teachers) received text messages from Teacher Heather. She is the Korean who is married to the head English teacher, who is Canadian. She teaches English classes and is also the intermediary between the Korean side of the school and us. She told us to come to school one hour later than usual. So when we walked to work the following morning, the sun being a little higher in the sky, we saw students playing in the snow and sliding on the ice. It was a happy sight.</p>\n<p>Yesterday the students had an official exam, I think some kind of province-wide standardized testing. All of my classes were canceled, so I worked on writing comments for student report cards. I didn&#8217;t see very much of the students until lunch time. When we came back from the cafeteria (which is in a different building), the students were playing in the snow. They were throwing the snow at each other. And they threw the snow at me. It was fun.</p>\n", "post_id": 1159, "location": false, "date": "12-08-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>Hello. \uc624\ub79c\ub9cc\uc774\uc5d0\uc694! (Long time no see.) It&#8217;s been a while. Let me tell you what we&#8217;ve been up to.</p>\n<p>To start with, we went home for a couple weeks (most of you knew this already). It was great, and it was relaxing. We didn&#8217;t have much time, though, so if we didn&#8217;t get the chance to see you, please understand. I spent much time playing with my three wonderful nieces. I was very excited because the youngest one played with me, too. Before I moved to Korea, she was very fussy (she still is) and wouldn&#8217;t let anyone near her other than her mother and grandmother. When I was home in July, she still didn&#8217;t know me very well. Therefore, I was still on the NO list. But this time&#8230;this time she knew me. She had seen our photos around the house and so now she knew who her Uncle Brian was (even if she called me &#8220;Uncle Tian&#8221;). And as fun as it was, three little girls (and a large family beyond that) is not exactly relaxing, even if it&#8217;s refreshing to be home with family after months in a foreign country.</p>\n<p>So we went to Maryland and saw Ashley&#8217;s family. Now there&#8230;<em>there</em> we relaxed. For a couple of days Ashley and I stayed in her Aunt Sharon&#8217;s house and just did nothing. If people wanted to see us, they came to see us. And they did, and after we had rested a couple of days we also went out of the house. I can say nothing other than that it was fun.</p>\n<p>Now, fast forward to Korea. Why? Because you&#8217;re mostly familiar with what happened in America, and this is a Korea blog, that&#8217;s why.</p>\n<p>On January 14, we resumed work. It was not ordinary work. The normal semester will not resume until this coming Monday, and it will last for only one week. That will be the end of the 2012 school year, and the 2013 school year will start on March 4 (the first weekday of March that isn&#8217;t the national holiday falling on March 1). Instead, at work we taught winter camp.</p>\n<p>In Korea, even during vacation, students often study. At our school, we had English winter camp for two weeks of the vacation. About a third of the school&#8217;s students signed up to take winter camp, which is an intensive program only in English. Normally, the students take only two English classes a day, and the rest of their schooling is in Korean. However, we taught them for every class in the morning, and then for one class in the afternoon, and then we had activities for two class periods to end the day.</p>\n<p>We started a little later than usual, and we taught the same students each day. I had a group of nine second-graders and one third-grader. Ashley taught a group of nine first-graders and two second-graders. We started the day with morning devotion, a ten-minute slot scheduled before our first class. In my class, we sang an English Bible song and did a very short memory verse. Then we had our first class, &#8220;Conversation.&#8221; I put that in quotation marks because even though the next class was &#8220;Reading Comprehension,&#8221; and the one following was &#8220;Grammar,&#8221; we didn&#8217;t follow that pattern at all. We simply went, page by page, through the books we had.</p>\n<p>We all had short books to use with our groups. Each student had the textbook, the accompanying workbook, and a winter camp booklet. The winter camp booklet had a page for each day of winter camp. There was a space to put that day&#8217;s earned stickers, an English diary entry for the day, and one or two sentences about an English book the students would read after lunch.</p>\n<p>So when we first started work on Monday, we didn&#8217;t know which group we would have or what we would be doing. We simply took the books to the classrooms, distributed them, and opened to page one. Fortunately, the books were decent. It wasn&#8217;t difficult to teach with them, and it wasn&#8217;t too difficult to throw in some activities to make the book more interesting.</p>\n<p>After three class periods (with a twenty-minute break between the first two), we had lunch. The elementary school doesn&#8217;t have a cafeteria. It has only a dining room. Normally, workers load a van with food and bring it to the school from the middle/high school next door. However, with the small student population, we simply walked over to the middle/high school cafeteria. (We foreign teachers usually go to the cafeteria anyway, and the whole school also does this whenever construction or weather prevents the van from getting to the elementary school.) The students normally eat with their Korean homeroom teacher in the elementary school dining room, but this time we walked the students over to the cafeteria and ate with them. It was kind of fun, actually. Later I would remark that leading a single-file line of students to and from the ping pong building felt good. I felt more like a teacher, since it&#8217;s a task I don&#8217;t normally do. As I was walking with a group of first graders and two kindergarteners on a foggy day, I saw Oseo Mountain in the distance and thought, &#8220;This is like an adventure. We&#8217;re heading for that mountain, escaping from orcs. I must protect these children from the orcs.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Anyway, back to reality, and the winter camp schedule. After lunch students worked on their diary entries and/or read a small English book. (Some students wrote their diaries at home.) I would check their diaries and make a few marks, and give them their earned stickers for the day (up to three for their morning vocabulary quiz, up to three for their diary entry, and up to three for reading). After this last forty-minute period, it was activity time.</p>\n<p>Each of us had an activity. I had ping pong. Ashley had English board games. The head English teacher had hockey. (Guess his nationality. You&#8217;re right.) Other activities included basketball, assorted playground games (tag, red rover, etc.), and pi\u00f1ata-making. On the first day of winter camp, I played ping pong with my group. The next day, all the groups rotated, so that each group did every activity at least once (and two activities twice). We made some adjustments to ensure that all groups had pi\u00f1ata-making twice (once to make the pi\u00f1atas, and again after the paste had dried to decorate and break the pi\u00f1atas).</p>\n<p>We had ten days (two weeks) of winter camp. The first Monday through Friday and the second Monday through Wednesday were normal days. It was Wednesday when my group, and Ashley&#8217;s, decorated and broke their pi\u00f1atas. The next day, Thursday, we all went to \uc548\uba74\ub3c4 (Anmyeondo, a nearby island). We stayed the night there at a sort of campmeeting resort place. In the afternoon, we had &#8220;Olympic Games&#8221; for the students. Instead of keeping our normals groups, though, students were quite reasonably re-grouped so that the physical attributes of the groups were more evenly distributed. We had tug-o-war, a sack race, pop-the-balloon-by-sitting-on-it, everyone-hold-hands-and-pass-the-hoola-hoop-without-letting-go, and musical chairs. My team came in second place. After a break, we had a collect-the-signatures game. We had nine stations, with a teacher at each station (a couple of Korean teachers helped us out on this one). Students had to go to each station and perform the activity. Once complete, the teacher would sign their sheet. We had a game of memory, a game of Twister, a code-breaking worksheet, a task of spinning a hoola hoop 100 times total among all team members, lining up in alphabetical order and introducing yourselves (having to restart if the alphabet was out of order), a game where students had to sequentially put on and take off a funky outfit, and so on. My team came in third in this one.</p>\n<p>And here&#8217;s where I say that the students got spoiled. The day before, they got candy from their pi\u00f1atas. Before the Olympic games started, we told the students an object lesson about the ingredients of cake, which on their own aren&#8217;t very tasty (especially flour or a raw egg), but together are delicious (leading to <a title=\"Romans 8:28 at BibleGateway\" href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+8%3A28&amp;version=KJV\" target=\"_blank\">Romans 8:28</a> and a small piece of cake for each student). After the Olympic games the teams got snack prizes, and also after the station race. The next morning, some students told us proudly that they had stayed up the whole night having a snack party. \uc544\uc774\uace0! (\uc544\uc774\uace0 is an interjection mildly expressing dismay, shock, or frustration.)</p>\n<p>Then we had dinner. The school appreciated our hard work so much that they forked over quite a bit of money to order \ud68c for us. \ud68c is raw fish. Ashley had been busy when the vice-principal came to ask us if we were interested in having \ud68c for dinner. When she came back I said to her, &#8220;\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc800\ub141\uc5d0 \ud68c\ub97c \uba39\uc744 \uac70\uc608\uc694&#8221; (&#8220;We&#8217;ll eat raw fish for dinner&#8221;), and she said, &#8220;REALLY?&#8221; with the biggest eyes I&#8217;ve ever seen on her. She was so very happy to hear that.</p>\n<p>After dinner, we went to the backyard, near the beach, and had a bonfire and some small fireworks. This was one of the worst parts of winter camp. This was when the air was icy and windy. Quite windy. I think we went back in earlier than the school had planned.</p>\n<p>Afterward, we retired to our rooms. The next morning, we had a walk along the beach scheduled for 7:00 am. The students were not pleased about this. Neither were the teachers. The conditions were icy, windy, and &#8220;7:00 am.&#8221; We pretty much walked out to the water and turned back, had breakfast, and went back to the school. There, we had a small lunch and a closing ceremony, where we gave each student a certificate. Among the certificates were Excellence Award, High Achiever Award, Most Helpful Student, Good Reader Award, Good Writer Award, and Perfect Attendance, for those students to whom we couldn&#8217;t honestly give any of the other awards. Finally, we had one last round of spoiling the students in order. We had counted how many stickers they had earned. Each sticker translated into one talent (like the Biblical measure of wealth). We had the &#8220;talent market,&#8221; where students used their talents to buy snacks and gifts.</p>\n<p>In the end, winter camp was a lot of fun. It was stressful at first, because we taught effectively without break for the whole day. Normally we have prep periods and whatnot, but in winter camp, it was a whole-day sprint. However, I think we adjusted (even if we did feel relieved and exhausted when it was all over). By the second week, I felt like I was in the groove. After all, I had only ten students, and I worked with them all day every day, so I got to know them quite well.</p>\n<p>This last week we worked without teaching at all. Instead, we have been getting things ready for next week, our final week of school, and for the next school year. We have been making yearly plans, attendance sheets, grade sheets, and report card objectives. We&#8217;ll teach next week, and then we&#8217;ll have a week off. That week off is not a normal thing, but instead it was the school&#8217;s kind offer. I guess they think we&#8217;ve been working really hard and wanted to treat us. After that, we&#8217;ll come back for another week and a half to finish preparations for the 2013 school year. Then it will begin.</p>\n", "post_id": 1209, "location": false, "date": "02-01-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>(by Brian)</p>\n<p>Last Friday, the 25th of February, I met my primary co-teacher. Her name is \ubc15\ub204\ub9ac (Pak Nuri, or Nuri Park) and she is quite nice. That&#8217;s her next to Ashley in the picture below:<a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/haeundae-6.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-124\" title=\"Haeundae.6\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/haeundae-6.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a></p>\n<p>That picture was taken outside the Ambassador Hotel in Haeundae Beach by \uc774\uc6d0\uad6c (Lee Won Gu, or Daniel Lee). You can see him here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/haeundae-7.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-126\" title=\"Haeundae.7\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/haeundae-7.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a></p>\n<p>Mr. Lee is the head teacher over the English teachers at \uc8fc\ub840\uc5ec\uc790\uace0\ub4f1\ud559\uad50 (Jurye Yeoja Godeung Hakkyo, or Jurye Girls&#8217; High School). He took Ms. Park, Ashley, and me out to breakfast on Sunday (he is a very nice old man &#8211; would you believe that he is 60? I was quite surprised when he said so).</p>\n<p>Not only did he treat us to breakfast at a beachside hotel, but he also bought us a pizza to eat on Friday when we met him. Here&#8217;s something you should know about the price of pizza in Korea: As with most Western food, it&#8217;s pretty expensive. Your average pizza in Korea runs the equivalent of around $35. Of course, in Korea, pizza is LOADED with toppings. (I&#8217;d show you a picture, but I didn&#8217;t take one that day. Sorry.) [Update: This is wrong. Mr. Lee said this, and it's true that some pizzas can get to that price, but it's also possible to find pizza between 6 and 15 dollars.]</p>\n<p>So Ms. Park had taken me to our school to meet the principal, Mrs. Jung, and Mr. Lee also greeted us and sat down with me to talk. Ashley&#8217;s co-teacher brought her to my school because (I assume) Mr. Lee wanted to meet her too. At one point, Mr. Lee asked me if I was a Christian. I couldn&#8217;t figure out why he had asked me (the previous topic had nothing to do with religion), but I said yes, and he replied, &#8220;I am Presbyterian.&#8221; I think his excitement over our shared beliefs is a major contributor to all the nice things he has done for us. I will list a few more of them here. In addition to giving us a much-needed lunch on Friday and treating us to a fancy breakfast on Sunday, he has:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>provided me with a (temporary?) pay-as-you-go cell phone to use (I think until I get paperwork to get my own&#8230;or maybe for the whole year?)</li>\n<li>arranged for Ashley to get one soon, too</li>\n<li>took me to work on the first day of school (Wednesday, March 2) since my route to work involves two buses</li>\n<li>took Ashley and me to Costco on Tuesday so we could get groceries and cleaning supplies for the apartment</li>\n<li>brought another pizza over on Monday because he wanted to take us to Costco then, but couldn&#8217;t, so he brought a pizza instead and ate it with us</li>\n<li>asked his co-workers if someone lived close enough to my apartment to give me a ride to work (I don&#8217;t think anyone does live nearby, but it was a nice thing for him to ask)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Anyway, Mr. Lee asked us where we went to church, and I told him it was called Pioneer Memorial. He asked if it was Baptist, Methodist, etc., so I told him that it was a Seventh-day Adventist church. Apparently he has heard of it. He even went to the SDA English Language Institute when he was in college. I think it&#8217;s good that he knows our denominational background, so whenever I have to turn down extra hours on Saturdays (as I had to do already, because Ms. Park asked if I was interested in earning extra money by teaching two Saturday classes), he will know why (it&#8217;s in our contracts anyway that we&#8217;re only supposed to work Monday through Friday, but we have heard of some people getting pressured to work on weekends by principals who don&#8217;t know the contracts so well).</p>\n<p>Speaking of principals, I think I have a pretty good one. Ms. Park took me to the principal&#8217;s office on that first Friday, and at first it was kind of awkward. But I can tell that Mrs. Jung wants our professional relationship to be a good one. She also wants me to be well-adjusted to Korean life and her school. She told me that first day something along the lines of, &#8220;You should be comfortable in my school so that you won&#8217;t go home exhausted.&#8221; She also said, &#8220;You can get to know the male teachers of my school, and you can play table tennis or badminton.&#8221; Apparently it&#8217;s true. Ms. Park has told me that some of the male teachers want to recruit me to play ping pong and badminton with them after school. I&#8217;m okay with that!</p>\n<p>Mrs. Jung also said on the school&#8217;s intercom (on the first day of school on Wednesday when she and various staff members were making start-of-school announcements), &#8220;He is a foreigner and is not accustomed to our school, so please treat him like my favorite.&#8221;</p>\n<p>So that&#8217;s what happened at the beginning of the first day of school. Lots of things were said over the school&#8217;s PA system in Korean (unless they regarded me, and then Mrs. Jung spoke in English). Then we went to the auditorium, where Mrs. Jung introduced all the new teachers, including me, to great applause and cheering by the student body. Someone gave me a sheet that had a chart on it, and I asked Ms. Park what it was. I knew what it was, actually, but I could tell (even though it was in Korean) that someone had scheduled me for two Saturday classes. She looked at it and said, &#8220;This is your timetable. [pointing at each day] Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday &#8212; oh, someone put Saturday in your schedule.&#8221; So she gave it back to someone to have it fixed, and thus I didn&#8217;t know my schedule until Thursday. Good thing, then, that I didn&#8217;t start teaching until Thursday.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s another reason it was good that I didn&#8217;t start teaching until Thursday: I already told you that Mr. Lee picked me up on Wednesday. He told me he would be at my apartment at 7:30. At 6:50, while I was finishing the last 10 or 15 minutes of my lesson plan, he called and said he would be here in 10 minutes. I still had to get dressed, and I figured I needed most of those 10 minutes to do so. I managed to finish my work in the car, but I was still rather out of order for a few hours afterward!</p>\n<p>So if I didn&#8217;t have to teach on Wednesday, what did I do after the assembly? I sat around and met people, of course, and tweaked my lesson plan. One teacher, a mathematics instructor named Mr. &#8220;John&#8221; Park, was one of the more notable co-workers of that first day. He introduced himself and chatted with me for a few moments. Later, around 11:30, he asked me if I liked kimchi and if I wanted to get lunch. So I went with him to the cafeteria, but then we discovered that, because it was the first day, the cooks were still getting things in order. Okay. So we went back down to the teachers&#8217; office and waited. He also showed me a room upstairs that had some workout equipment and some ping pong tables. He said it was important to exercise to relieve the stress of being a teacher in Korea.</p>\n<p>On Thursday, I had my first class. Ms. Park was my co-teacher. It went horribly. We couldn&#8217;t get the laptop connected to the big screen for my PowerPoint, so I had to adjust my speech because of it. We had a game/activity that didn&#8217;t seem to go so well, and overall it felt very awkward and even more like failure. I had two more classes, 3rd and 4th period, before lunch, with Mr. Jung (not related to the principal &#8211; remember that most Koreans have one of a handful of family names), and these classes also didn&#8217;t go so well, but maybe a bit better than the first. At least my PowerPoint worked, and I liked Mr. Jung&#8217;s co-teaching style.</p>\n<p>After lunch, I expected the students to have the full-stomach effect. But 5th period completely made up for 1st, 3rd, and 4th, and thus I went home feeling much better. My classes on Friday continued the trend, and I think the answer is this: The students in the first few classes could sense my unease and nervousness, and that translated into resistance.</p>\n<p>My major failure on Friday was attempting to use the Korean alphabet to explain the pronunciation of pizza. In Korea, pizza is called \ud53c\uc790. It&#8217;s pronounced &#8220;pee-jah,&#8221; and I don&#8217;t understand it. Many words in Korea that are borrowed from English sound the same, but with the Korean writing system (Hangeul). Or they don&#8217;t sound the same because Hangeul doesn&#8217;t have a character for certain sounds. But neither is the case with pizza. If Koreans spelled it \ud555\uc0ac, it would be pronounced peet-sah, which is not quite peet-zah, but much closer than pee-jah. So, because quite a few students used the word &#8220;pee-jah&#8221; in class, I decided to try to show them a &#8220;better&#8221; way to spell it so they could understand the proper pronunciation (after all, we&#8217;re supposed to help with that anyway). But at the crucial moment, I misremembered how Koreans spelled pizza. You see, \u3142 and \u314d both make a P sound. But \u3142 is also a slightly B sound, while \u314d is purely P (aspirated). I wrote \u3142 on the board instead of \u314d, so the students kept saying no. Then, because \u3145 (S) becomes a T if it is at the bottom of a syllable, I used it like this: \ud54f\uc0ac. But apparently, if it is ALSO at the top of the NEXT syllable, it remains an S. So I was still wrong. Thus I looked like a fool, and I don&#8217;t even want to know what Mr. Lee was thinking. It was my last class of the day so I couldn&#8217;t even make up for it with a better performance in the next class, but I think I got over it. I&#8217;m just going to be very careful from now on with Hangeul.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_125\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/6group.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-125\" title=\"(6)Group\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/6group.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The English teachers of Jurye Girls' High</p></div>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n", "post_id": 123, "location": false, "date": "03-05-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>(by Brian) (written the night before posting)</p>\n<p>I won\u2019t lie.

The job opportunity was appealing, yes, but what I was excited about was the food.</p>\n<p>Yet when it became official that we were actually going to Korea, I became slightly nervous. Was I right about the food? I had only tried a few things at the Korean restaurant in Mishawaka. Would I like the rest of it? As it turns out, yes, I would.

It was some kind of leaf coated in some kind of sauce, and pretty much everyone at orientation hated it. I would rather eat a liquefied Big Mac.</p></div>\n<p>I love how Korea has so many options for how to get or eat your food. There are sit-down restaurants and low-table restaurants of all different sizes and styles. There are street vendor carts and cozy street vendor tents. There are food courts and convenience store food stations. There are take-out places and there are magnets.</p>\n<p>Wait. Magnets?</p>\n<p>Yes. Magnets. A few days after we arrived at our apartment, we came home to find a magnet on our door. Every door had one. The magnet was fixed to a booklet advertising the local delivery options. We learned from the Internet that these magnets are pretty common, and after a while I think we might be able to coat our fridge with them.</p>\n<p>Each page has a phone number and a menu, or part of a menu, if a business has multiple pages. We can\u2019t understand much of the booklet, but we understand enough. Some of the menus have pictures for every item. Some do not. We can read and understand some of the food names. Some we cannot.</p>\n<p>One day, we collected some courage and called one of the numbers from the booklet. I had seen a video from eatyourkimchi.com about ordering delivery food, so I had an idea of what I had to do. It was easy to guess anyway. The phone rang and someone answered in Korean. I said \uc548\ub155\ud558\uc138\uc694 (annyeonghaseyo, or hello), and then I read the food item I wanted to order, a sushi platter big enough to feed two or three people. The man on the other end of the line said something that I pretended was, \u201cWhere would you like this delivered to?\u201d So I told him my address, carefully enunciating the apartment number. A mistake could mean the wrong apartment or even the wrong building within the complex.</p>\n<p>If he had asked me something else, he must not have minded because then he proceeded to ask me for my telephone number.</p>\n<p>No, really. He said it in English. I tried to provide my phone number, but even though I can count to ten in one of the Korean number systems, I realized that I wasn\u2019t sure how to say \u201czero.\u201d I think he started to get frustrated and then I realized that he recognized the zeroes. He must know English digits, then. And he did. He said something else and then hung up the phone.</p>\n<p>And then we waited. \u201cWell,\u201d I told Ashley, \u201cif no one knocks on our door in about an hour we\u2019ll know that someone else got an unexpected visit.\u201d</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_135\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_1664.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-135\" title=\"IMG_1664\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_1664.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">But, as you can see, the food came.

I called a different place this time and ordered three items: \uae40\uce58\uc6b0\ub3d9, \uc0dd\uc120\ucd08\ubc25, and \uce74\ub808\uc815\uc2dd (kimchi udong, saengseon chobap, and kare jeongshik).</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_136\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_1669.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-136\" title=\"IMG_1669\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_1669.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Pictured: Translation.</p></div>\n<p>One of the soups was kimchi udong (or kimchi udon). It is <em>good stuff </em>that I will definitely <em>eat again.</em> The other soup was a plain udon soup that came with the curry. And there was some nigiri sushi, too.</p>\n<p>The curry was kind of mild for our tastes and we didn\u2019t like that three of the pieces of nigiri were shrimp, but other than that our meal was excellent.</p>\n<p>In America, nigiri sushi will cost you between one and five dollars, depending on what kind of fish you get and whether you get sushi at a place like SoHo Japanese Bistro or a hole-in-the-wall like Lawrence Fish Market. One piece of nigiri probably uses as much sashimi-grade fish as an entire maki roll, which is why one bite of food is so expensive.</p>\n<p>In Korea, though, we can afford to eat nigiri sometimes. It cost us \u20a916,500, or about $14.81.</p>\n<p>Oh, wait. That was our entire meal. The sushi alone (without the side dishes it came with) might have cost us $20 or $30 in America, twice the amount we spent on our entire dinner. And it was a lot of food. We both got full, and <em>then</em> we finished the food. We could have ordered two items instead of three.</p>\n<p>Also, there is no tipping in Korea. That price included the delivery. And if you take another look at the most recent image, you can see that this particular place is one of the many that provides \u201creal\u201d dishware to use rather than disposable (the first gave us disposable, though). We ate our food out of washable bowls and trays, and then we put the dishes outside our door for the restaurant to pick up at a later time.</p>\n<p>How awesomely convenient!</p>\n", "post_id": 133, "location": false, "date": "03-09-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>I would like to thank my Father in Heaven for some of the best days I&#8217;ve had in Korea this year. I am still elated by the joy I felt the first half of this week in Seoul.</p>\n<p>Last week was the final week of the 2012 school year at our school. Next week and the week after we&#8217;ll go in to work in order to prepare for the 2013 school year, which will start the following week (March 4). But this week that is about to end we were given off as an unexpected and additional bonus to the three-week vacation we had at the end of December.</p>\n<p>Ashley and I spent the first part of the week in Seoul. We met our friend Kristina on Sunday morning at COEX, which is a large underground shopping mall in the Gangnam district of Seoul (that famous district from PSY&#8217;s song &#8220;Gangnam Style&#8221;). We would have liked to hang out with both Kristina and Rodrigo, but Rodrigo is Korean, and Sunday was \uc124\ub0a0 (Seollal, or Lunar New Year). Seollal and the harvest festival, Chuseok (\ucd94\uc11d), are the two most important holidays in Korea. They are observed for three days (the day of and the two days surrounding it), and everyone goes to spend these days with their families (or their husbands&#8217; families). Therefore, Rodrigo was not available.</p>\n<p>So we spent the day with Kristina at COEX. We&#8217;d been there once before, just to walk around and to eat dinner at the food court. We were there late in the evening on Christmas Day (the night before boarding a plane to Chicago), so the place was rather crowded and some places were closed (the aquarium, for example). This Sunday, though, the place was rather empty when we first arrived. We arrived in the later part of the morning, for one, and most people were still with their families. That would change later in the afternoon, though, because Korean holiday traditions and rituals are morning activities. In the afternoon and especially in the evenings, people will go out.</p>\n<p>All three of us had eaten just before coming to Seoul, so we weren&#8217;t hungry, but we made a plan. We asked each other what we had wanted to eat, and Kristina suddenly said that she felt a craving for Mexican food. It was perfect. We hadn&#8217;t thought of it ourselves, but one of the places that had been crowded the last time we visited COEX was a Mexican restaurant called On the Border. Last time, we were told the wait would be around two hours.</p>\n<p>So knowing that COEX had a Mexican restaurant and suspecting, by all appearances of the partial menu posted outside and the number of people (including foreigners) eating at this restaurant, that the food was worthy, we jumped at the idea. We told Kristina that we knew just the place. But as I said already, we weren&#8217;t ready to eat. Not yet.</p>\n<p>So we walked around COEX awhile and then decided to check out the aquarium, which had been closed last time. There were quite a few families here, of course, because of the holiday, and also because aquariums are good places to take your children. If I end up back in Korea for some reason or other when I have children a few to several years old, I would like to take them to <a title=\"COEX Aquarium\" href=\"http://www.coexaqua.co.kr/eng/index_eng.asp\" target=\"_blank\">COEX Aquarium</a>.</p>\n<p>The aquarium looks small. There is an entrance and next to it you can see the exit. It&#8217;s among dozens of other establishments in the mall, so you don&#8217;t really expect it to have much. So we went up and saw that an adult ticket cost \u20a919,500 (or, according to current currency conversion calculations, close to $18), which almost made me hesitant, considering the apparent size of the attraction. But we went and were delighted to find that foreigners get a discount. After looking it up, I found that international visitors received a 30% discount for the first 11 days of February in celebration of Seollal. So yay Seollal!</p>\n<p>Then we were further delighted to find that the aquarium wove in and out and round and about and betwixt and between and in places unseen from outside. We spent a couple of hours looking at the various sea creatures in the aquarium. The animals were truly beautiful, and I just loved one section of the aquarium that turned various non-aquarium items into aquarium items. There was a telephone booth filled with water and goldfish. There was a post office box with fish. There were lamp posts and washing machines filled with water and sea creatures. There were fish tanks in the walls framed by picture frames, with paintings at the backs of the tanks, so that the fish inside were swimming in paintings. There was a harp-shaped fish tank with strings made of light, which made sounds whenever the fish swam through and broke the paths of light (an awesome concept, even if the resultant &#8220;music&#8221; is not so inspiring).</p>\n<div style=\"width: 578px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/2013-02-10-13-18-35.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image \" id=\"i-1486\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/2013-02-10-13-18-35.jpg?w=568&#038;h=758\" width=\"568\" height=\"758\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ashley looking at a manatee. Those things are so cool.</p></div>\n<p>By the time we got out of the aquarium, it was well time for lunch. We went straight for On the Border. We only had to wait fifteen minutes. We sat down and were overwhelmed by the menu. What to do? There were so many delicious things. There were enchiladas, empanadas, tacos, fajitas, salads, and oh so many more. For me, I had but one solution, the final page of the menu which informed me that I could create my own combo of two, three, or four items.</p>\n<p>So Ashley ordered a steak fajita salad. Kristina ordered a plate of enchiladas. I ordered a combo: a chicken empanada, a cheese and onion enchilada, a beef enchilada, and a chicken taco. It came with rice and <em>refried beans</em> (you can&#8217;t get them in Korea). We also ordered guacamole and some stuffed peppers as an appetizer. Those stuffed peppers&#8230;that empanada&#8230;those beans and the cheese enchilada&#8230;I nearly cried with joy. I&#8217;m serious. Ashley asked me if I was about to cry. The only disappointments were the guacamole (not so well seasoned, but other expats assure us to next time try the &#8220;Guacamole Live&#8221;) and the beef enchilada (a bit dry, but I&#8217;ve had dry enchiladas in the States, too).</p>\n<p>Thus began a very food-centered mini-vacation. Our lunch was late and very filling, so we didn&#8217;t eat much for supper (other than a few &#8220;mooncakes&#8221; and some drinks at a coffee/tea shop in the evening). But for the following days, we indulged. On Monday we ate at Richard Copycat&#8217;s All-American Diner, a place we had visited once before in foreigner-heavy Itaewon. Ashley got a garlic butter steak. I ordered a Philly cheesesteak sandwich. It was nothing short of delicious. For supper we tried Kervan, a traditional Turkish food restaurant, also in Itaewon. Ashley ordered lamb kebabs and I ate Turkish lamb chops. We had a lavash (balloon-like bread) with some hummus, which was amazing, and I braved to try ayran, a Turkish yogurt drink. Nothing disappointed.</p>\n<p>Am I making you hungry yet? Me, too, but I&#8217;m not finished. Various people had told us to try <a title=\"Butterfinger Pancakes (not official site)\" href=\"http://hsong.egloos.com/2415662\" target=\"_blank\">Butterfinger Pancakes</a>, so we went there for a late breakfast (essentially lunch) on Tuesday. You should know that Korea doesn&#8217;t really have breakfast food. They eat rice, soup, and kimchi for breakfast, just as at most other meals. Anything you can eat for lunch or dinner can be eaten for breakfast, it seems. But Butterfinger Panckes, in almost IHOP fashion, serves breakfast from 7 am to 3 am. The menu is massive: about two feet long, one foot wide, and double-sided. There were too many options, and it was a risk that I would take too long to decide even though we asked to look at a menu while we waited for a table. No problem, though. I have a breakfast weakness. One of the first items I noticed on the menu was a corned beef hash that came with pancakes. I browsed the rest of the menu, but my mind was essentially made up. For a moment I was tempted to try something called the French Spongebath, because I like to try new things, but it didn&#8217;t come with pancakes.</p>\n<p>When we sat down at a table and the server came to take our order, Ashley asked for an omelette, which came with pancakes. She chose honey instead of syrup, and when the server brought our food, she brought a jar of honey with one of those old-fashioned honey sticks with the beehive at the end. I was impressed. However, when I ordered the corned beef hash, the server told me that they were sold out. &#8220;That&#8217;s fair,&#8221; I thought, &#8220;and shows that the customers before me know what&#8217;s good.&#8221; This might have been a cause for panic. But I thanked God that I had a back-up dish in mind. I ordered the French Spongebath.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 578px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/2013-02-12-12-53-13.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image \" id=\"i-1492\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/2013-02-12-12-53-13.jpg?w=568&#038;h=426\" width=\"568\" height=\"426\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The French Spongebath (after a few bites, I admit).

It&#8217;s a vanilla shake with crushed Oreos and also a mixture of ground sweets (Oreos, Skittles, butterscotch, and Choco Crunch, according to the menu, and some nuts, according to my eyes). No Butterfinger candy bar (I think the name of the restaurant is not based on the candy), but it was&#8230;I want another one.</p></div>\n<div style=\"width: 578px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/2013-02-12-12-53-02.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image \" id=\"i-1506\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/2013-02-12-12-53-02.jpg?w=568&#038;h=426\" width=\"568\" height=\"426\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ashley&#8217;s omelette. She exercised more pre-photo restraint than I did (she but cut the omelette in half). Fortunately for me, she wasn&#8217;t hungry enough to eat it all. I got to taste everything, including those delicious pancakes.</p></div>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">For supper that night, we ate at a place that serves <a title=\"a picture of \ucc1c\ub2ed\" href=\"http://www.netq.co.kr/xe/bo3_04/files/attach/images/673/143/006/1_P1040700.JPG\" target=\"_blank\">\ucc1c\ub2ed</a>,\u00a0 or &#8220;steamed chicken.&#8221; The English translation is wholly insufficient. I encourage you to click the link to see a picture of the food to better understand what it is that we ate. This restaurant serves only \ucc1c\ub2ed, but they make it very well. Your menu options, other than for drinks, are to choose which kind of noodles you want (thick, thin, or a mixture of both), what size plate you want (small, medium, or large, with half a chicken, a whole chicken, or a half and whole chicken), and whether you want some seasoned overcooked rice to add to the remaining sauce once the chicken is gone. We ordered a whole chicken with thick noodles and hot pepper burnt rice. It was yum yum YUM. We remarked how it was the first time we&#8217;d eaten \ucc1c\ub2ed since leaving Busan (when we used to even order it by phone and have it delivered to our apartment).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">So our vacation was very satisfying in terms of food. When I went to Korean class Thursday evening and one of my co-workers asked how my vacation was, I said, &#8220;I ate <em>all</em> the delicious food.&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">But food wasn&#8217;t all. As I said, we spent some time with Kristina, a friend we haven&#8217;t seen in several months. After On the Border, we walked around some more in COEX. We browsed the large bookstore in the mall and, after we tired of that, we took the subway to \ubabd\ucd0c\ud1a0\uc131\uc5ed (Mongchontoseong Station), which was the station nearest our hotel, so that Ashley and I could check in. After that, we walked to a nearby coffee shop and spent a few hours there simply chatting. Eventually the time came when Kristina needed to go to Gangnam Station to catch a bus back home, and so we said our farewells and Ashley and I went back to the hotel.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The next day, after eating our steak and Philly cheesesteak sandwich, we went to What the Book?, which is an English bookstore in Itaewon. Usually we browse the whole store but this time, for whatever reason, we walked in, looked straight at the used section of science fiction books, and did not leave that spot until we were finished. There was a 3+1 deal on used books, so Ashley bought three and even I chose one (I say &#8220;even&#8221; because I&#8217;m usually hesitant to buy books, having already and shamefully a few unread books in my possession).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Since we were in Itaewon, where the big size clothes stores are, I decided to try going to one to see what they were like. I also wanted to get another sweater or two. I didn&#8217;t used to be a sweater kind of person. I would wear T-shirts year round and wear a jacket or coat outside. But my parents gave me some sweaters for Christmas and I really liked them. Plus, you can&#8217;t really get away with T-shirts indoors in Korea, not when they don&#8217;t insulate their buildings the same way Americans do, or when the hallways in the schools aren&#8217;t heated.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">So I went to a store that looked approachable. (In Itaewon, many men will accost you and try to sell you a custom-made suit, or sports jerseys, or whatever, because Itaewon is the place for buying custom-made suits or sports jerseys or whatever. It is the more annoying aspect of this area.) It was a nice little shop. I found some nice sweaters and bought them, and the woman who worked there was very nice. On the way out the door, I said to her, because it was the third day of the Seollal holiday, \uc0c8\ud574 \ubcf5 \ub9ce\uc774 \ubc1b\uc73c\uc138\uc694 (&#8220;Happy new year,&#8221; or, more literally, &#8220;Please receive much happiness in the new year&#8221;). She was very touched and quite shocked at my Korean. I think that even though Koreans are often shocked if a foreigner can speak a few words of Korean, this woman was especially shocked because we were in Itaewon. The first time I visited Itaewon I had culture shock from seeing so many non-Koreans.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">After this, we went to a coffee shop, where Ashley ordered a black tea drink and I ordered a mint chocolate drink. And where we also sat for a few hours reading the books we had bought at What the Book? until it was time for supper (when we ate at Kervan). After supper we went back to the hotel and continued to read. I picked a good book. I finished it at home, after we came back to \uad11\ucc9c (Gwangcheon), and I think it was written very well. The book easily stands on its own, but I was delighted to find out from the Internet that it&#8217;s the first book in a trilogy. Normally I avoid series (remember, I have enough books on my waiting list already), but I&#8217;m glad that later, when I feel like devoting a day to reading again, I can resume reading about these characters and find out more about the world they live in. I won&#8217;t even have to wait, because all three books are already published. Sadly, when Ashley approached the final pages of her book, which she had thought was a single-volume story, she realized that the story was not anywhere near finished. The Internet told her that book two of her trilogy will be published next month (and who knows when book three will be out).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Finally, day three of our trip. Tuesday. (Okay, we left Wednesday, but that consisted of checking out of the hotel, going to Yongsan Station to catch our train back home, and eating lunch at the station before actually boarding the train.) This was museum day. After our Butterfinger Pancakes breakfast of awesome and joy, we went to \uc11c\uc6b8\uc2dc\ub9bd\ubbf8\uc220\uad00 (the Seoul Museum of Art), where we saw a special exhibit based on the works of Tim Burton, including not only props and clips and designs from his movies, but also sketches and sculptures and artwork from his personal life. In fact, 85% of the exhibit was from his personal collection of unseen artwork (according to the pamphlet). There was even a page from his high school composition class and an encouraging rejection letter from Disney after he submitted a children&#8217;s book early in his life. No pictures allowed, of course, but here&#8217;s one of Ashley outside the building:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/2013-02-12-16-18-23.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image aligncenter\" id=\"i-1595\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/2013-02-12-16-18-23.jpg?w=568&#038;h=426\" width=\"568\" height=\"426\" /></a>The exhibit was kind of creepy. You know what Tim Burton&#8217;s movies are like. His artwork is not much different. Some of it was, though. (And I have to say that I was surprised to learn that Burton directed <em>Mars Attacks!</em>, <em>Batman</em>, and a few other movies that seem completely different in style compared to movies like <em>Edward Scissorhands</em>, <em>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</em>, <em>Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street</em>, or <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>.)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">After the Seoul Museum of Art we journeyed to another area of Seoul popular with foreigners, Hongdae, to find the Trick Eye Museum. After that we ate the \ucc1c\ub2ed. Here is now, to end this post, a series of pictures we took at the Trick Eye Museum.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a

mention that after we went to the Trick Eye Museum, before we ate \ucc1c\ub2ed for dinner, Ashley and I went to \ub178\ub798\ubc29\u00a0 (singing room). It&#8217;s like karaoke, but you get a room for yourselves, so the only people watching you sing are your friends or co-workers, and not the entire establishment. We took turns singing, and since there were only two of us, we each sang more songs than usual (we&#8217;ve never gone by just ourselves). I started by singing <a title=\"\ubc14\ub78c\uae30\uc5b5 on YouTube\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5ShDNOqq1E\" target=\"_blank\">&#8220;\ubc14\ub78c\uae30\uc5b5&#8221; by \ub098\uc5bc</a>, which is one of my favorite Korean songs at the moment. It&#8217;s slow enough that I can actually sing along, and my score at the end was 98! I tried a few other Korean songs, with varying levels of success, until I gave up and crossed over to my native tongue. I&#8217;ll have to practice a few Korean songs before I go again. Ashley stuck to English-language songs, but she sang them, of course, with a much more beautiful voice than with the voice I used. Her only disappointment was that her selection was limited, since most songs she knows and likes to sing are hymns and gospel songs.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\ub178\ub798\ubc29 is a lot of fun, but usually one of us isn&#8217;t in the mood for it. On Tuesday night, we both happened to be in the mood for it, so we went. After we left, we said to each other that it was fun, that we should go more often.</p>\n", "post_id": 1382, "location": false, "date": "02-15-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>(by Brian)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_1682.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-142 aligncenter\" title=\"IMG_1682\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_1682.jpg?w=312&#038;h=234\" alt=\"\" width=\"312\" height=\"234\" /></a>Ashley and I went on our first hike in Korea on Saturday. We went to a mountain called \uae08\uc815\uc0b0 (Geumjeongsan). Some fellow foreigners from our Facebook group for Busan Guest English Teachers were going to meet at a subway station and take a bus to the trailhead for the mountain.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">It didn\u2019t quite work out that way, but it still worked. A married couple of GETs who live near us (but whom we haven\u2019t met yet with our busy schedules) figured out a better set of directions for the mountain than the ones posted on Facebook, so we were going to follow their lead (which they also posted on Facebook). But somehow, to make a long story short, we never met up with anyone at either of the two proposed subway stations (probably because our bus ride took longer than we expected).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">So we went alone. We found bus 90, which took us from near \ubc94\uc5b4\uc0ac (Beomeosa) Station to the Beomeosa Temple. We didn\u2019t see much of the temple complex until after our hike, but we walked around a garden path before beginning our primary journey. Then we took photos of some stone flag pole bases and began our climb.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_143\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_1690.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-143\" title=\"IMG_1690\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_1690.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The stone pillars had turtles on the bottom. Their faces looked kind of angry.</p></div>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Most of the trail was made of rocks and boulders. Sometimes we would see a family eating lunch on a large flat boulder off to the side. We walked for probably thirty minutes before we saw some familiar faces.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">They came from behind us, two people from our class in orientation, Luke and Daniela. Not a minute later, another half-dozen or so GETs (from the group we were supposed to meet with, but not the entire group) came down. They had started on another trail and were going down the one we went up.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_144\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_1698.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-144\" title=\"IMG_1698\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_1698.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Great Wall of Geumjeongsan</p></div>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">We continued, and it was a long journey. We stayed with our two companions, so now there were four of us. They were the first two people I had seen since orientation ended, except one girl we saw briefly at the subway the day after it ended. I don\u2019t know how long it took, but eventually we got to the North Gate, which reminded me of the Great Wall of China. There was a water fountain that had some very awesome water (and no, it wasn\u2019t only because I was thirsty; we brought water, and I tried both kinds back-to-back with a clear winner, pun intended). From the North Gate the trail split into three sections. I think there was some talk of taking the longest (about 3.7 kilometers), but we ended up taking the shortest (about 1.1 km).</p>\n<p>Amen.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_145\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_1701.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-145 \" title=\"IMG_1701\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_1701.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">This is the Fountain of Life. Daniela is filling one of the plastic drinking bowls, and those are Ashley&#039;s hands taking her picture. And yes, there were about 10 bowls there, and everyone drinks from them.</p></div>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Ashley had read about how there were two main paths up the mountain, with one being significantly easier than the other. After about 15 minutes of hiking, we realized we had started on the difficult side of the mountain. So we were tired already. The fork in the road was on a flat surface, which was nice for a while, until it resumed its steep, rocky existence.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">But hey, we finally made it to the top, which was well worth the work of walking so far and climbing so much. We could see very far, farther than my camera\u2019s f/8 aperture could capture. (So if you want to see how awesome it looks, you can come to Korea&#8230;or give me $500 for a low-end professional camera to take some more detailed photos&#8230;or I guess you can go with a Google Image search, but where&#8217;s the fun in that?) The four of us sat down and shared the food we had all brought. Luke gave us some \uae40\ubc25 (gimbap, which is rice and veggies &#8211; and sometimes meat &#8211; in a roll of sheeted seaweed), and we shared some chocolate-covered cherries that we had brought with us across the ocean. After we had all rested up, we made our way back down the mountain. It took much less time, and it was a bit easier, but I still could not wait to get back to the bus.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">And now, for a photo break:</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_146\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_1702.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-146 \" title=\"IMG_1702\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_1702.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">People in Korea love to make the peace sign for photos.</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_148\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_1704.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-148\" title=\"IMG_1704\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_1704.jpg?w=500&#038;h=666\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"666\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The sun was almost behind us, which makes this photo kind of dark, but there we are at the very top.</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_149\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_1706.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-149\" title=\"IMG_1706\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_1706.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">We are on top of the world.</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_150\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_1709.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-150\" title=\"IMG_1709\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_1709.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">We had plenty of space on the top rocks to sit and walk around.</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_151\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_1713.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-151\" title=\"IMG_1713\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_1713.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">And even climb some more!

Daniela took it. Quite nice, though, eh?</p></div>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">At orientation some people, who had been in Korea for a few months or years already, had told us that everyone is very friendly while hiking, contrasted with the impersonal characteristics of people in the city. A large number of people passed by us, heading in the opposite direction, and many of them would say \uc548\ub155\ud558\uc138\uc694 (annyeonghaseyo, or hi) or even \u201cHello.\u201d One older man, whom we saw shortly after we got off the bus, asked us, \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d I thought his English was pretty good for an older man (since the strong push to learn English in school did not start until the early-middle 90s), and I replied, \u201c\ubbf8\uad6d\u201d (miguk/mee-gook, which means beautiful country and also America). Because of that one word, he asked me, \u201cWhere did you learn Korean?\u201d (Many Koreans will be very excited or surprised when foreigners say just a word or two of Korean.) Then he asked if we were living in Korea, so we replied yes. He told us to enjoy our hike, and then we went our separate ways.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">At the fountain of life, a Korean woman ran up to Ashley and had a friend take her picture with her. She also pushed Luke into the photo, and maybe me too. I was already close to Ashley, so I might have already been in the frame. Daniela, although a Mexican-American, apparently looks sort of Asian, so she wasn\u2019t pushed into the photo. It was the most enthusiasm I have seen during my three and a half weeks in this country. I&#8217;m not saying that Koreans don&#8217;t get excited. I&#8217;m saying that this woman was <em>very</em> excited. We all had a good laugh later.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">But for some reason, on Saturday, the friendliness and foreigner fascination wasn\u2019t contained to the open air of nature, where people are generally less reserved. When we got to the subway station, a man noticed that Ashley and I were trying to figure out which line we needed to board, so he asked us where we were going (in perfect English) and told us the answer.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">A minute later, an old woman came up to us, not quite as excited as the photo woman from the mountain, but still with joy plastered on her face, and handed us some bookmarks. She traced the cross symbol that was on them, so we knew right away what she was doing. She talked to us in Korean and was about to turn away when I gave her back her bookmark.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">No, I wasn\u2019t being mean. She had mistakenly given me two, so I returned one, using both hands per Korean custom. She smiled and said \uac10\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4 (gamsahamnida), which means thank you. And then, of course, she continued to talk to us in pure Korean. I think I recognized the Korean name for Jesus, so I responded by saying, Yes, Jesus, in Korean (I have forgotten the name exactly and am not sure on the spelling). Ashley and I were both pretty sure that she had said something like, \u201cJesus bless you.\u201d</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">A man on the subway train itself was passing out cards that advertised some church service on one side (in Korean), but the backside was the Ten Commandments. In English. He gave one to everyone and said something in Korean. To us, he spoke in broken English, reciting Genesis 1:1 and telling us to believe Jesus. I checked both the bookmark and the card for any references to the Korean words for Sunday or Saturday, while wondering if the high amount of witnessing going on had anything to do with it being Sabbath. Probably not, but I would have been amused if I had seen \ud1a0\uc694\uc77c (toyoil/toh-yoh-eel, or Saturday) anywhere on the bookmark or card.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Anyway, Ashley and I arrived at our apartment probably seven hours after we left it. We took a bit of a rest before heading back downtown for some well-deserved food!</p>\n", "post_id": 141, "location": false, "date": "03-14-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>(by Ashley)</p>\n<p>Being <em>waygookin </em>(a foreigner) in Korea means being different from almost everybody else here, and it&#8217;s quite an interesting experience.</p>\n<p>In the United States, I&#8217;m not different. Now, there were cases growing up where I felt <em>very</em> different, like during black history month and I was the only black person in a class full of Caucasian and Mexican Americans who turned to look at me whenever the teacher mentioned the term \u201cAfrican American.\u201d However, in America, most of the time, I was not <em>that</em> different. When I walked down the street in a big city or in Berrien Springs, people didn&#8217;t stare\u2014well, not usually unless they were male.</p>\n<p>In Busan, South Korea, I&#8217;m very different because in Korea, most everyone is Korean. And, unlike in America, you can tell whether a person is Korean by looking at them. Americans all look different and come from various backgrounds. They can be Black, White, Mexican, Asian, painted or tattooed or whatever, they&#8217;re American. In America we do our best not to notice differences; we generally don&#8217;t stare at people of other ethnicities, hair colors or hairstyles. We don&#8217;t stare at people who have tattoos, unless it&#8217;s some strange design across their face. In Korea, however, they do stare at foreigners and the tattoos of anyone who dares show them.</p>\n<p>And I may not have a tattoo, but I am decidedly not Korean. So when I walk down the street, I get various responses. Some people ignore me, or at least pretend to, which I do appreciate. Some people stop what they&#8217;re doing and stare openly\u2014in some cases mouth agape. And some people talk to me, ask questions, or make small sounds of surprise.</p>\n<p>Being ignored is fine. It&#8217;s a lot like being back home.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s usually the older generation who stares mutely. But this stare is generally not uncomfortable for me, just <em>interesting</em>. When I notice them looking, I just smile and keep on with whatever I was doing. It doesn&#8217;t bother me because they don&#8217;t look angry or upset, they just <em>look&#8211;</em>sometimes rather intently. And I kind of understand where they&#8217;re coming from, too. After a few weeks in Korea, I find myself doing double-takes at other foreigners myself; it&#8217;s just a little surprising to see one, after so many Korean faces.</p>\n<p>Anticipating this scrutiny, however, does have some side effects that I&#8217;m sure Brian does not appreciate. I find myself taking a lot of extra time in the mirror before going out. As a cultural ambassador of sorts, I feel it is my duty to look good. \u00a0I don&#8217;t want to misrepresent America to the Ajummas (visor-wearing older women&#8211;who may push you** out of their way with no remorse) and Ajushi (older men&#8211;very likely to be your local taxi driver or apartment security guard) of South Korea. Not all older people stare, though. Some try to help me if I look lost, others try to witness to me about &#8220;Jesu,&#8221; while others greet me and say nice to meet you in Korean.</p>\n<p>Younger people greet me most often, usually in English, and they might even change course to follow me. Sometimes they just run up stand in front of me to stare wide-eyed and smiling. Sometimes they ask me where I&#8217;m from. The other day a small girl I passed while walking down a busy part of the city said, \u201cHello, nice to meet you.\u201d I said, \u201cNice to meet you, too,\u201d And her mom made an approving sound. Most of the time, they say \u201chello\u201d or \u201chi.\u201d Last week, as I was walking home from school some tween boys even shouted, \u201cYou are beautiful.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yesterday, when Brian and I attended the Busan I&#8217;Park soccer game at the Asiad Stadium, the ticket guy looked extremely surprised to see me. He exclaimed, \u201cWow!\u201d and then proceeded to sell me two tickets (one for me, and one for Brian). I get the impression that many Koreans in Busan have never seen a black person, except on movies and TV. Some of them, like the enthusiastic woman Brian wrote about in his  hiking post, seem to equate being foreign with celebrity. I heard that woman coming from a few yards away and thought &#8220;Oh no.&#8221; She spoke loudly and excitedly (pardon my adverbs) in Korean, rushing over to take a picture with the foreigners, and shoved me front and center\u2014That picture probably makes me look terrible, as I had just popped in a big mouthful of kimbap and was frantically trying to cheese my way through it (although in Korea they say kimchi instead of cheese).</p>\n<p>The strangest thing so far about being different in Korea, has to do with my hair. <em>All</em> of the girls at my school seem fascinated by my locs. They sometimes stand near me and stare, not at my face, but at my hair. They say lots of things in Korean and I hear the word \u201chair\u201d or \u201chairstyle\u201d often. On the way home from school one day, a sixth grade girl asked me \u201cTeacher, hair why?\u201d several times. I didn&#8217;t have a good answer for her, of course, because the language barrier prevents me from explaining to her about genetics, dominant traits, hair texture, and the problems (psychological and technical) I&#8217;ve had with using heat or chemicals to straighten my hair.</p>\n<p>Today in class it was no different, several girls asked if they could touch my hair, and I let them since they had asked so politely. After getting a closer look, or touching a loc, students generally make the thumbs up sign and say something like \u201chairstyle good.\u201d&#8211;Though I&#8217;m sure at least one student must have said my hair was weird or strange in Korean, since one of my co-teachers translated it to me as \u201cunique.\u201d I chuckled inwardly, because there&#8217;s no way for me to know, nor do I care.</p>\n<p>Now that I&#8217;ve talked a little about some things that I&#8217;ve noticed about being different in Korea,  let me tell you about some things that are different about Korea that I really enjoy.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It&#8217;s different to go to work, and \tchange into slippers. My slippers feel especially comfortable after \twalking to work in the mornings. I generally hate to put my \u201cregular\u201d \tshoes back on at the end of the day.</li>\n<li>It&#8217;s different that the students \thave to bow to teachers and say &#8216;annyeonghaseyo.&#8217; Although most of \tthe students just say \u201chello\u201d or \u201chi\u201d when they see me, some \tof them bow and say \u201cannyeonghaseyo.\u201d I really love when the \tstudents don&#8217;t want to speak English in the halls so they bow and \tsay \u201cannyeonghaseyo\u201d to me instead. It seems so respectful, even \tthough I know they do it because they have to.Today, I was really \tsurprised when one boy had to go to the restroom shortly before my \tclass. The boy came up to me, stood in front of me, bowed deeply, then \u00a0asked if he could go before he turned to go out toward the restroom. It&#8217;s also very cute when I see tiny kindergarten students bowing to their teachers. \tI also like to bow to the other teachers and say \u201cannyeonghaseyo,\u201d so I like when they greet me in Korean instead of just saying &#8220;hello.&#8221;</li>\n<li>Brian mentioned this before, but they \toften deliver your food with real dishes and silverware, which they \tcome back later to pick up. That&#8217;s different, and I like it.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Anyway, I&#8217;m glad to be here.</p>\n<h5>**Although a lot of foreigners in Korea say they&#8217;ve been pushed out of the way by ajummas, I have not yet had the privilege. Usually, on the subway I feel a slight nudge, and then I move out of the way as quickly as I can. I&#8217;ve heard people say that Koreans are rude and bump into you etc., I haven&#8217;t been treated &#8220;rudely&#8221; yet.</h5>\n", "post_id": 160, "location": false, "date": "03-14-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>(by Brian)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Very early in our Korean experience, Ashley posted a list of things she <a href=\"http://129degreeseast.wordpress.com/2011/02/26/5-reasons-i-like-korea/\">liked about Korea</a>. Now that we have been here for a little more than a month, I would like to add to that list. Here are more things that makes Korea cool, in no particular order.</p>\n<p><strong>1: Design</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Maybe this item is on my list out of ignorance of other cities, but I enjoy the design of cities in Korea. Or at least the design of Busan. Because Korea is so small with such a large population, and with a majority of the land area mountainous, Koreans have mastered the concept of space efficiency. An observation I made early on about &#8220;downtown&#8221; areas of Busan was that most establishments were stacked on each other in sections of a city block. Within one side of a city block, therefore, you can easily find an assortment of restaurants, shops, and service-based establishments (such as pharmacies and doctors&#8217; offices).</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_174\" style=\"width: 235px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_1790.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-174\" title=\"IMG_1790\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_1790.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300\" alt=\"\"   /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">There&#039;s a sign against the wall that you can see if you are too close to the building to see the sign above the entrance.</p></div>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">My favorite part is the staircase. Most blocks will have several staircases leading directly into the building from the sidewalk. These staircases will usually have signs to tell you what is available in that section of the block. Some signs are flat against the building above the staircase, while others run up the side of the building, and some are on sandwich board signs on the sidewalk. Some are even on the steps of the staircase. Many times you can find the signs in at least two locations. You might not find this general layout pattern to be very interesting, but for some reason I really like it. It appeals to my appreciation for efficiency and user-friendliness.</p>\n<p><strong>2: Dental Health</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">In Korea, most people brush their teeth after every meal. I even saw a man brushing his teeth in the restroom of a restaurant we visited as part of our orientation activities. He had his toothbrush with him and a cup he used to collect water for rinsing.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">It&#8217;s no different at school. After lunch on my first day of work, Mr. &#8220;John&#8221; Park, a math teacher I <a href=\"http://129degreeseast.wordpress.com/2011/03/06/first-week-after-orientation/\">mentioned before</a>, showed me a cabinet in the men&#8217;s staff bathroom and told me I could keep my toothbrush in it. He said this with no suggestion. His tone implied that I already brushed my teeth after every meal and that now I knew what to do to continue that practice. After lunch the following day, Mr. Lee showed me that cabinet, telling me the same information with pretty much the same tone. So good teeth-brushing habits are one of the customs of Korea that Koreans aren&#8217;t aware aren&#8217;t practiced so thoroughly in other countries.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_172\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_1770.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-172 \" title=\"IMG_1770\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_1770.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" alt=\"\"   /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A cabinet in the men&#039;s staff bathroom at my school. My mug is not in the photo because it&#039;s in a rather empty area of the cabinet. This photo shows more dental hygiene glory.</p></div>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">A few days later I finally brought in one of the mugs from our apartment plus a toothbrush. It actually seemed providential that Ashley had packed a value 4-pack of toothbrushes, so that I could have one at home and leave the other at work. The previous tenant of our apartment also left lots of unused tubes of toothpaste, so hooray! Now I brush my teeth an extra five times a week, which is probably an improvement of 100% or more beyond what I used to do in America. (Please don&#8217;t do the math. It will embarrass me.)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>3: Self-Awareness</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">I mentioned above that two of my teachers seemed to not recognize the cultural difference between dental hygiene habits in their country and in others. (I did, though, have another teacher recently ask me if I found that habit surprising. I told her I appreciated it for what it has done to my own dental care.) This observation can be applied to much of my experience in Korea. I will admit that any culture other than the one I grew up in can provide this third item, but it&#8217;s happening in Korea, so Korea gets the credit.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Anyway, something I learn often in Korea is that we take a lot more for granted than we think, including what seems to us like obvious right answers or standard ways of doing something. In Korea, I&#8217;ve learned that, hey, other people think differently. We all know that, but seeing just how different their thoughts are, in an entirely different context, is one of the biggest learning experiences I have had, and I will be encountering more during my stay here. Yeah, almost everyone knows or guesses that people bow to each other here, but did you know about&#8230;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>4: Service?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Most likely not. &#8220;Service&#8221; in Korea is a Konglish word (meaning it is a word that Koreans use to express something in English that either is pronounced or spelled differently or has a different meaning) meaning &#8220;free&#8221; (and &#8220;free&#8221; in Korea often refers to &#8220;one size fits all&#8221;). So in a way, it&#8217;s proper that I have a question mark in the subtitle of this item. (I actually think it is service to provide for something free, so it&#8217;s not entirely Konglish, but some people think it is).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Now that I have made a tangent with three too many parenthetical phrases, I&#8217;ll get to my point. In Korea, there&#8217;s a thing called service, and it means getting stuff for free. I&#8217;ve heard about it a lot on foreigner forums, but didn&#8217;t really experience it until just a few days ago. Ashley and I went to the local grocery store. We bought the equivalent of about 45 dollars of groceries, and halfway through ringing up our purchase, the cashier reached beneath the cash drawer and pulled out a 1.5-liter bottle of Chilsung Cider (&#8220;cider&#8221; being another Konglish word meaning &#8220;soda pop&#8221;). She set it with the groceries she had already scanned and said, &#8220;Service,&#8221; with a smile. Apparently, this is not an entirely rare occurrence, nor is it limited to grocery stores or even large purchases.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>5: Sharing</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">I&#8217;ll tell you upfront. You probably won&#8217;t like this one. You might think to yourself, &#8220;Why, that&#8217;s a reason to <em>not</em> like Korea or want to go there!&#8221; But I appreciate it nonetheless (maybe only because it&#8217;s different, but I think there&#8217;s more to it than that).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Here is what I mean by sharing: Koreans share their food. During orientation, one lecturer, a young Korean man who was responsible for telling us a bit about Korean history and culture, told us about the time he was in Starbucks with an American friend. They both ordered a coffee and the friend also asked for a brownie. Our lecturer told us, &#8220;I was thinking, &#8216;Oh, we&#8217;re going to share the brownie. I <em>am</em> kind of hungry.'&#8221; Because in Korea, people share food. He thought they would each have their coffee and they would split the brownie. Then the American friend ate the brownie alone, and the Korean was a bit surprised and sad. (See? More cultural differences.)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">About a week ago, during a meeting for English teachers, one of my co-workers gave me half of his \ub5a1 (ddeok, which sounds almost like the word &#8220;duck&#8221; and which is a generic term for several kinds of rice cakes). Normally, I politely refuse when people offer me things because I believe they&#8217;re politely offering. But in Korea, it&#8217;s not a polite offer. You almost have to take it, because it&#8217;s important to share.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">And onto the part you won&#8217;t like. The part where things get messy. Here it is: Koreans not only share their food, but they share bowls. If you go to a restaurant in Korea, you will usually receive an assortment of side dishes with your meal. Everyone eats from these side dishes together. You take your chopsticks, you grab a piece of food from the dish, and you eat it. You might go back to your own plate of food for a while, but then you&#8217;ll take your chopsticks and grab another bite of a side dish item. And if there is a big bowl of soup for everyone to share (which is often the case if you&#8217;re eating \ube44\ube54\ubc25, or bibimbap, a bowl of mixed rice and vegetables), you share one spoonful at a time. You take a spoonful, you eat it, and you get another spoonful or return to your dish. There&#8217;s no worry about sharing germs or anything (unless someone is actually sick, and that person will probably portion out their own separate serving). For some reason, Ashley and I like this. We&#8217;ve embraced it. It&#8217;s easier, for one, and it makes the bond between meal companions even stronger. So what if the spoons of five different people have been in that bowl? Stomach acid kills most bacteria anyway.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Hey, while we&#8217;re on the subject of restaurants, let me tell you about item number&#8230;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>6: Restaurants</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">I wanted to have an item for the button alone, but I think it makes more sense to tell you about it with two other things: prices and menus. So at Korean restaurants, you&#8217;ll probably get a menu you don&#8217;t understand at all. You could be brave and pick something at random. Ashley and I did this once and we were thankful that what we ordered wasn&#8217;t still-squirming octopus, but a dish of grilled fish. Some menus will have English, too. But some menus&#8230;ah. Some menus are just plain awesome. They take up a lot of space, but they tell you everything you need to know. Take a look at it, right here:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_1792.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-175\" title=\"IMG_1792\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_1792.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>Some restaurants have menus that are made of replicas of the menu items. These are all made of plastic but look pretty close to what you&#8217;re actually ordering. So you can know if a certain dish has tentacles or not, or if this particular establishment puts onions in their bibimbap. I think that&#8217;s pretty helpful.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Restaurants are also (usually) very affordable. Sometimes you might be slightly overcharged because you&#8217;re a foreigner. (So I can&#8217;t wait to know enough Korean to dissuade street vendors from taking advantage of my ignorance. Until then, we pretty much stick to places that list their prices, which is already most of them anyway, including most street vendors.) But for the most part, eating out is fairly cheap. If you eat at a Western restaurant, you might pay a bit of a premium, but most places are reasonable. Look at these pictures, for example:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_1761.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-169\" title=\"IMG_1761\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_1761.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" %\" /></a><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_1762.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-170\" style=\"text-align:justify;\" title=\"IMG_1762\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_1762.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" % /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_1764.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-171\" title=\"IMG_1764\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_1764.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" %\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Looks pretty fancy, right? I didn&#8217;t get a picture of it, but this place had a ballroom-type feel to it. Very elegant. And each booth had fancy drapery partitions. The atmosphere alone made me feel like I should be spending $30 a plate. But it was actually closer to $16. Total. And remember, there is no tipping in Korea. (By the way, that is indeed a couch Ashley is sitting on. A big one. And a comfy one.)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Okay, now you can finally learn about that mysterious &#8220;button&#8221; I mentioned earlier. What was that about, right? The button is a device that is on your table at many restaurants. Instead of having waiters come by your table every 5 minutes, interrupting your conversation, or not showing up when you want them to, you get a button. You press the button, a waiter comes to your table. It&#8217;s that easy. (Okay, so sometimes we don&#8217;t press the button and a waiter still comes, but we figure it&#8217;s because they think we don&#8217;t know about the button, being foreigners, and we have been taking a rather long time to decide what we want to eat, which reinforces the idea that we don&#8217;t know how to get their attention.)</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_168\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_1757.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-168\" title=\"IMG_1757\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_1757.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The button, in all its helpful glory.</p></div>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Before I leave you, I&#8217;d like to tell you about one more cool thing Korea has to offer:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>7: Puppies</strong></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_176\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_1793.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-176\" title=\"IMG_1793\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_1793.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">&quot;AWWWWWWWWWWW!&quot; - At least two or three readers of this blog.</p></div>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">What?

It&#8217;s been a real adventure. I&#8217;ll\u00a0 tell you about some of these experiences.</p>\n<p>One of our co-workers, Linda, has family visiting her in Korea. Her mother and her younger sister. Linda took them to a meat buffet restaurant Saturday and invited her friends. So Ashley and I went. So did Katelyn, the new teacher at our school. Linda&#8217;s family is quite nice and I&#8217;m glad we got the chance to not only meet them, but also to spend some time getting to know them. Anyway, we went to this restaurant, and Linda also invited a teacher who is new to the area. She came to Korea just weeks ago and wanted to meet people. She had been unable to attend the Friday night &#8220;Welcome to Hongseong&#8221; party that many of the foreigners in our area had gone to. So she was there, and Linda also has a few Korean friends. They were there, too, although they arrived later than everyone. This will be a factor for a later part of the story.</p>\n<p>And what do you know, that later part of the story is now. After we had finished eating, Linda planned to show her family what a \ub178\ub798\ubc29 (noraebang, or &#8220;singing room&#8221;) is like. The Koreans told us to go ahead to the noraebang. They&#8217;d come when they were finished eating. So we went. There were ten of us total, four staying behind to finish eating (three Koreans and the new teacher). That left me more or less in charge. I led us to the noraebang that our friends had suggested (after we declined their first recommendation because we&#8217;d been there, and it was not heated). There, I told the attendant, &#8220;\ub124 \uba85 \ub354 \uc62c \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.&#8221; <em>Four more people are coming.</em> Then his response made me think he didn&#8217;t have any big rooms. Eventually I realized that that&#8217;s precisely what they&#8217;re called in Korean: big rooms. &#8220;\ud070 \ubc29 \uc5c6\uc5b4\uc694?&#8221; <em>There are no big rooms?</em> He assured me that there were. So we paid him and he showed us to the room. The six of us started singing some songs for a while, and finally the other four showed up. We had a lot of fun. There are a few Korean songs I can sing at noraebang, although this particular noraebang didn&#8217;t have all of them. But I sang one of them and the Koreans were impressed. I sang an American rock song called &#8220;I Walk Beside You,&#8221; and one of the Korean women brought Ashley to the singing/dancing area (she always did this whenever one of us was singing, to bring the other to the singer). So I turned to Ashley as I sang the chorus (&#8220;I walk beside you / Wherever you are / Whatever it takes / No matter how far,&#8221; and so on).</p>\n<p>Eventually there were more Korean songs to be sang, and I was roped into joining. I did better than I expected. It was a lot of fun, and quite dangerous for the ego when the Koreans told me that I was \ucd5c\uace0 (&#8220;the best&#8221;). Eventually noraebang ended. We went home. The Koreans didn&#8217;t need help. That left seven of us. Six of us wanted to go back to Gwangcheon (Linda, her mom, her sister, Katelyn, Ashley, and I), while the new girl in Hongseong (Melissa) wanted to go to, well, her apartment in Hongseong. The area we were in wasn&#8217;t really a downtown kind of area. The buses had stopped running and taxis weren&#8217;t exactly lined up waiting for fares. We walked to a nearby bus stop. One taxi waited there. On the way to the bus stop, I had typed Melissa&#8217;s address on her phone from her registration card, because Melissa can&#8217;t read Korean yet to tell the taxi driver where to go, and the font for her address on the registration card was super super tiny.</p>\n<p>Back to the cab. It&#8217;s possible to call a cab, and I&#8217;ve done it successfully once in life, but it&#8217;s a very uncertain thing when you don&#8217;t really know what&#8217;s being said on the other end of the line. Here we didn&#8217;t really have a good marker for telling our location. So I did something else. I approached the taxi and opened the front door. I said to the driver, &#8220;\ub9ce\uc740 \uc0ac\ub78c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub798\uc11c \ud0dd\uc2dc 2 \ub300 \ub354 \uc804\ud654\ud558\uc138\uc694. \uad1c\ucc2e\uc544\uc694?&#8221;\u00a0 <em>We are many people, so please call two more cabs. Is this okay?</em> There were a few more exchanges between us to figure out exactly what we wanted (such as where we were going and a clarification on the number of additional cabs needed). Then he took Linda and her family back to Gwangcheon. A second cab arrived and Melissa took that one back to her apartment. Finally a third cab arrived and we took that to Gwangcheon. When I told the driver we wanted to go to Gwangcheon, he asked us where in Gwangcheon. I don&#8217;t really know how to say that, so I tried to say &#8220;\uad11\ucc9c\uc5d0 \uac08 \ub54c\ub294 \ub354 \ub9d0\ud560 \uac70\uc608\uc694.&#8221; <em>At the time we go to Gwangcheon, I&#8217;ll say more.</em> But toward the end of my sentence I kind of stumbled over the Korean syllables that were being formed by my mouth. He understood anyway (praise the LORD). So we arrived in Gwangcheon and I said, &#8220;\uad11\ucc9c\uc624\uac70\ub9ac\uc5d0 \uc67c\ucabd\uc73c\ub85c \uac00\uc8fc\uc138\uc694.&#8221; <em>At the Gwangcheon five-way intersection please go left.</em> (I realize now that I used the wrong particle, \uc5d0 instead of \uc5d0\uc11c.) He took us home and Linda&#8217;s cab was in the parking lot turning around. The driver realized that we were all together and he laughed. We had enough money to pay the fare seen on the meter, but I was trying to find a 1,000 won note so he wouldn&#8217;t have to break a 10,000 won note. He reduced the price for us and insisted on it, so as we got out of the cab, I said to him, &#8220;\ud589\ubcf5\ud558\uac8c \uc624\ub798\uc624\ub798 \uc0ac\uc138\uc694.&#8221; <em>Please live happily for a long, long time. </em>He seemed to appreciate that.</p>\n<p>The next day the six of us went to Seoul. It was Katelyn&#8217;s first time, and we also went to show the Seoul Grand Park Zoo to Linda&#8217;s family. This is where the story takes a turn. We were going from Yongsan Station to Seoul Grand Park Station. It was a journey of eight subway stops, including one line transfer. Halfway to our destiny, when the train came to Sadang Station, many people got off the train. Hey, plenty of seats, let&#8217;s all sit down, eh? So we sat down. Then we remarked how there were <em>lots</em> of seats. Then I stood up and looked up and down the train. There wasn&#8217;t a person on board. &#8220;Oh, I think we have to get off and get on another train,&#8221; said somebody. So we made our way toward the doors in an effort to get off the train. That effort was 83.3% successful. If you&#8217;re really good at math, you know that means five of us managed to get off the train before the doors closed insistently.</p>\n<p>As I pulled my bag from the doors &#8211; not at all like elevator doors &#8211; I looked for an emergency open button. None to be found in the few seconds I had before the train resumed its journey to just-where-does-the-train-go-when-it&#8217;s-being-swapped-out-for-a-different-one? I looked at my friends through the window. The looks on their faces. Like I was on a wrong plane taxiing down the runway to another country. Like I was being sent to the slaughterhouse. Like I was too late in reaching the airlock on a spaceship before the pod bays were to be automatically opened.</p>\n<p>So by God&#8217;s grace, I smiled and waved at them as the train began to move, in an effort to encourage them. I thought, &#8220;Well, I suppose this is going to the train garage or something. Might be a while before I see them. I&#8217;ll just text them telling them to head to the zoo and I&#8217;ll meet them there whenever I get there.&#8221; Before I could finish the text, though, Linda called. I don&#8217;t remember what we talked about. I think it had to do something with the sudden situation I was currently in. An old woman with a broom and dustpan went from car to car sweeping up trash and dust. After she passed me I started to follow her. I started to say &#8220;\uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c&#8221; (&#8220;How?&#8221; as in, &#8220;How do I leave?&#8221;), and she promptly told me to sit down and many other things which I couldn&#8217;t understand. So I sat. The train stopped. I couldn&#8217;t see a single speck of light beyond the windows of the train car. A man without a broom passed through the cars. The old woman came back through. She spoke to me again and this time she pointed at the map. I recognized \ub098\uac00\uba74 (&#8220;if you go out&#8221;) and wondered how that could fit into anything relevant to this situation. &#8220;IF I go out&#8221;? She also said something about Sadang. We had just left Sadang, though. She said a lot, and so I tried to ask her in my own words to see if I understood correctly (which was less of me really understanding and more of just making an educated guess). &#8220;\uc0ac\ub2f9\uc5d0 \ub3c4\ucc29\ud560 \ub54c\ub294&#8230;&#8221; I couldn&#8217;t finish the sentence before the woman affirmed that that was right. Which is good, because I hadn&#8217;t prepared the rest of that sentence in my head, or I might have stumbled over some more syllables. The sentence, by the way meant, &#8220;At the time of arriving in Sadang&#8230;&#8221; with the unspoken half being, &#8220;\ub098\uac08 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\uae4c?&#8221; (&#8220;I can go out?&#8221;)</p>\n<p>I called Ashley back, because she had called while I spoke with the woman. I told her what I knew, and by now the train had reversed directions. We were going back to Sadang. <em>So this is weird</em>, I thought. <em>The train went forward empty and now it&#8217;s returning to the station we were just at. Instead of people having to get off and wait for another train, why not stay on this one and wait there instead?</em></p>\n<p>Except that was the wrong thinking. When I arrived at Sadang Station, I walked out of the train and saw that the signs now read that this car was going away from Seoul Grand Park. I felt like I was in the Twilight Zone, which is what I said to Ashley on the phone (we were still on the phone). Somehow I went forward, stopped, went backward, and suddenly I&#8217;m on the other side of the platform. I think I know now what happened (writing it out makes it so obvious if I hadn&#8217;t figured it out by now), but at the time it was very strange. Of course, the entire experience was very strange.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I crossed to the other side of the platform and waited for a train. I was two stops behind Ashley and the rest of our group. Ashley said she&#8217;d wait for me at Seoul Grand Park Station. In fact, everyone decided to wait for me. There I met with my wife and friends again. I learned that Linda&#8217;s mom had had a bit of an anxiety attack for my sake, which, while I really didn&#8217;t want anyone worrying about me and certainly don&#8217;t like that I caused a mild panic attack, did make me feel touched.</p>\n<p>This blog is full of successful Korean usage, and that streak made me feel really good, and praise God for it all. Without Him I wouldn&#8217;t be able to learn, and my errors would prevent any fruitful communication whatsoever. But He got me through it. Perhaps I nonetheless still had too much pride. When we got to the zoo, I tried to buy tickets for us. Katelyn had already gone to the ticket counter for the tram car to take us to the zoo entrance. There was that counter and a counter for a package ticket (tram car, zoo, and sky lift). We didn&#8217;t want the sky lift, though (a combination of people that seemed not keen on heights and a previous experience of the sky lift having <em>very</em> long lines). We only wanted the tram car tickets and tickets for the zoo. When I tried to buy only zoo tickets at the package counter, the woman said it was for package tickets only. When I tried the tram car ticket counter, one of the two women working there said some things to me, but even though she spoke through the microphone, the other sounds in the building drowned her out completely. I only saw her making an X with her arms. Was the zoo not open today? The six of us tried to figure out what was going on. They were selling package tickets, so obviously the zoo was open. Where were the tickets? So I went back to the ticket counter and went in the other line this time. There were fewer people nearby so I could hear this time. But the woman spoke in rapid Korean, and I couldn&#8217;t catch a thing she said. I didn&#8217;t recognize any of it. I tried to rephrase my questions and do all sorts of things but&#8230;why did she have to speak so fast? I know she wasn&#8217;t yelling, but speaking through the microphone and speaking fast and speaking unintelligibly to a person in a vulnerable situation made it feel like yelling. It didn&#8217;t help when she looked at her co-worker to see if she could help address my concerns, or maybe to telepathically share, &#8220;What is up with this \uc678\uad6d\uc778?&#8221; I thought, &#8220;Maybe the ticket counter for the zoo is after the tram car ride, even though it&#8217;s strange that you can buy package tickets here, including a zoo ticket, but not just a zoo ticket.&#8221; So I tried to ask, in broken and intimidated Korean by now, if that were so, but all I received in response was more quick and unintelligible speaking. I have to admit that for about ten minutes afterward I just felt so defeated. I wasn&#8217;t really bothered by the whole ordeal on the train (other than being slightly embarrassed initially), but for some reason I felt&#8230;&#8221;traumatized&#8221; is too severe a word&#8230;by the experience at the ticket counter.</p>\n<p>But at least, in the end, we decided to just get on the tram car. And yes, at the zoo entrance was the ticket counter for &#8220;zoo only&#8221; tickets.</p>\n<p>Overall, I was quite happy this weekend to use my Korean. I&#8217;m thankful to my Father in Heaven for giving me the ability to learn the modest amount of Korean I have gained so far, and for giving me the opportunities to practice using it in real-life situations. I&#8217;m even thankful for the awful experience I had at the ticket counter. Perhaps I can learn a thing or two about how my students may feel at times. Or at least it can encourage me to fill in the gaps of my Korean skills (though the metaphor would be more accurate if I said the gaps were in my ignorance&#8211;I&#8217;ve got a lot to fill.)</p>\n", "post_id": 1762, "location": false, "date": "03-10-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>(by Brian)</p>\n<p>&#8220;Do you know what this means?&#8221; Kristina asked. &#8220;This is the first time I&#8217;ve seen you two as a married couple!&#8221;</p>\n<p>And it was true. More than a year ago, our friend Kristina graduated and left Michigan to go back home. A few days ago, she came all the way to Busan, South Korea, to see Ashley and me for the first time since she left Andrews University.</p>\n<p>Okay.\u00a0 So I&#8217;m making Kristina out to be an amazing friend who traveled halfway around the globe to see us. Only the first part of that assumption is true. Kristina is currently living in Gumi, South Korea, so she only had to take a train for two hours to get to Busan. I played the same trick, inadvertently, on a co-worker at work. She asked if I enjoyed my weekend, and I said I did because a friend of ours came to visit.</p>\n<p>&#8220;All the way from the US?&#8221; she asked with disbelief and a bit of awe.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; I replied. &#8220;She&#8217;s been living in Korea for nearly a year, up in Gumi.&#8221; My co-worker said she was in Gumi for a wedding on Saturday. So I guess Busan and Gumi traded residents for a couple of days.</p>\n<p>Kristina arrived a couple of hours after we got off of work. Although we do not live near a subway station, I can walk to one in about ten minutes from my school, and Ashley&#8217;s school is near a stop for the same bus I take to work. So Ashley and I met each other after work to meet Kristina at Busan Station. It made more sense than going back home and then turning right back around. We finally met her around ten to seven, even though her train came in a quarter-hour before that. We had waited at the wrong platform.</p>\n<p>But then we found each other near an in-station Burger King. Yay! We spent quite some time trying to find a place to eat. The whole ordeal was very awkward. Not because we hadn&#8217;t seen Kristina in so long and it was therefore weird (it wasn&#8217;t, except in the standard, everyday wow-we&#8217;re-meeting-each-other-in-Korea-after-all-this-time feeling, but you know how that is). It was because of two things. First, we spent quite some time choosing a place, which involved walking by what must be an area aimed at foreigners, including a woman, dressed like someone who isn&#8217;t very dressed, who emerged from a restaurant to ask if we wanted something to eat.</p>\n<p>Nope. We kept walking.</p>\n<p>We eventually found a place that serves \uc0e4\ube0c\uc0e4\ube0c (syabeu-syabeu, or shabu-shabu). Kristina told us about this food and wanted us to try it. So we did.</p>\n<p>The second thing that made our meal endeavors awkward was being fed by the restaurant. Let me tell you something else about Korea. At many places, you cook your own food. The table has a built-in grill, and the server brings you the food, turns on the grill, and comes back only to give you refills of side dishes or to give you more meat to cook, etc. It&#8217;s pretty neat, actually.</p>\n<p>With foreigners, though, many servers will come back, especially if they notice you just sitting at the table dumfounded, to cook the food for you. We weren&#8217;t quite dumbfounded, but we weren&#8217;t sure when to put the thinly-sliced squares of beef into the vegetable-filled broth. We waited for the broth to boil, but the server beat us to it. She came by and started placing the beef squares into the broth. She let it cook for a few moments, then took it out with some vegetables, and placed it on my plate. Then she placed a bite on Ashley&#8217;s plate, and finally one on Kristina&#8217;s.</p>\n<p>Okay. Thank you, kind Korean food server, for showing us how to enjoy our shabu-shabu. Now we know how to do it oursel\u2014Wait. What are you doing? Putting more on our plates but first insisting that we eat what you have already given us? Okay, I&#8217;ll eat this first bite, and then you&#8217;ll refill our plates once and, feeling confident that the \uc678\uad6d\uc778 (oegukin/waygookin/foreigners) know how to cook and eat shabu-shabu, leave us to our meal and company.</p>\n<p>I was wrong. This woman served us, bite-by-bite, for half of the meal, only relinquishing her awkward imposition after some other customers arrived.</p>\n<p>I made sure every time she came by to have the tongs in hand to put a piece of beef in the broth, to discourage a repeat performance. It was very considerate of her, but we ate half our meal in silence instead of conversing with each other.</p>\n<p>And that&#8217;s how we spent our first meal. Then we came back and showed Kristina the apartment. We had spent the day before cleaning it, including, for me, finally emptying my last suitcase of the clothes still in it and waiting to be put away. (In my defense, to do that I first had to wash a very dirty plastic clothing drawer set that had sat out in the laundry area.)</p>\n<p>Kristina gave us a gift when we got to the apartment. It was a pack of flower cards, which are used to play Go-Stop, a type of &#8220;Korean poker.&#8221; Apparently, you can get arrested for playing with them if there&#8217;s a bet involved (because gambling is illegal outside of casinos). Or even if the police <em>think</em> there&#8217;s money under the table. We played that game until we started being so engrossed in conversation that we couldn&#8217;t pay attention to the cards anymore. And it was a pretty fun game. And that&#8217;s how much of our weekend went. We wandered around, looking for food or a coffee-and-tea house or just something to see, and then we would talk with each other. She told us about her school, we told her about ours, and we talked about things back home and things in Korea and the past, the present, and the future.</p>\n<p>I will tell you about two things we sought out specifically before I finish. The first is the aquatic show at a certain Lotte Department Store. (Do you recognize Lotte from <a href=\"http://129degreeseast.wordpress.com/2011/02/18/the-vending-machine/\">my second post</a>? Lotte is huge. Lotte owns GE. Okay, that&#8217;s a lie, but Lotte is seriously huge.) The show is pretty cool. It&#8217;s the second time Ashley and I have seen it, and when we mentioned it to Kristina, she wanted to see it too. And when you read about it, you will want to see it, too.</p>\n<p>The aquatic show is the &#8220;world&#8217;s biggest indoor audiovisual fountain.&#8221; The fountain runs constantly as a basic fountain, with a few jets of water always bursting upward from the surface. But every hour on the hour, the department store plays a few songs on loudspeaker, and the fountain goes nuts. You&#8217;ll see color-changing lights. You&#8217;ll see jet-bursts of water blasting straight upward in varying heights. You&#8217;ll see arcs of water criss-crossing the fountain basin. And you&#8217;ll see letter-shaped water falling from the ceiling four stories up. Yes. There are two or three rings in the ceiling for water to pour down, and sometimes the water is timed just right to form letters. I&#8217;ve made out, so far, the letters for &#8220;Busan&#8221; and &#8220;Lotte,&#8221; in both English and Korean.</p>\n<p>The second thing I want to tell you about is \ud638\ub5a1 (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotteok\">ho-tteok</a>), an awesome fried pancake that is filled with a sweet sugar-cinnamon sauce and topped, often, with pumpkin seeds or nuts. Kristina heard that Busan had the pumpkin seeds (she was used to plain ho-tteok with only the pastry and the filling), so we found some ho-tteok to enjoy. And later we found some more. On Facebook, I posted &#8220;\ud638\ub5a1 \ub9db\uc788\uc5b4\uc694,&#8221; which means, &#8220;Ho-tteok is delicious.&#8221; I wish I could buy you one so you could try it. (If you come to Korea, I will buy you one. Or even two. Come on, you know you want to!)</p>\n<p>Eventually Kristina had to get back on a train. We had fun. It was good to see her again, and we told her we would try to visit Gumi before she goes back to North America at the end of next month. But today at work I realized that Kristina&#8217;s visit did something for me regarding how I think of Korea, and how I think of Busan. Kristina had never been to Busan. In a way, I felt somewhat responsible for being her guide (although not entirely, because she only expected to see us and not pack in an itinerary&#8230;and we&#8217;ve not been here long enough to be so responsible). Busan was our city, in my mind. Plus, we had our first visitor. Someone came to stay at <em>our apartment</em>. Our <em>home</em>. I&#8217;ve said it over and over, that I live now in Korea, and I&#8217;ve changed my location on Facebook to Busan, but Kristina&#8217;s visit seems to have really affected and settled that association.</p>\n<p>Or maybe it&#8217;s only because I finally unpacked the rest of that suitcase.</p>\n<p class=\"jetpack-slideshow-noscript robots-nocontent\">This slideshow requires JavaScript.</p><div id=\"gallery-185-1-slideshow\" class=\"slideshow-window jetpack-slideshow slideshow-black\" data-width=\"984\" data-height=\"410\" data-trans=\"fade\" data-gallery=\"[{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com\\/2011\\/03\\/img_1821.jpg&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;190&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;We cleaned the apartment and rearranged stuff before Kristina came.

At least it is at my school. Not only do you have free reign to craft creative punishments for unruly kids (the last couple of days my co-teacher has made the entire monkey-acting class do squats until they were sweating and silent), but every month we, the special teachers, get together for dinner. And by special teachers I don&#8217;t mean special ed (though we do have special ed students in some classes, but this is another issue). By special teachers I mean teachers of non core-curricular subjects. So our group is made up of the PE, music, English, Chinese, and a science teacher.</p>\n<p>Tonight was one of our monthly dinners. After school we went directly to a traditional Vietnamese restaurant. We took off our shoes, sat on the floor and were served very delicious somethings. The first course involved duck that we grilled ourselves at our table, and soup also cooked at our table. We rolled the grilled duck and assorted vegetables (shredded beets, lettuce, cabbage, cucumber, carrots, onions, bean sprouts etc.) in round sheets of rice-wrap. But first we dipped the rice-wrap in hot water to make it soft. After putting in the meat and veggies, we dipped the wrap into a sauce of our choice (there were three) and took a bite. Om nom nom. The next course involved putting noodles into the broth from the soup and eating the noodle soup. The final course involved putting bibimbap style rice (mixed with veggies) into the broth and eating this new rice soup. Needless to say, I was stuffed and wanted to go home and flop across the bed.</p>\n<p>But I couldn&#8217;t go home because I was about to learn another one of the perks of being a &#8220;special&#8221; teacher. Every month, we also get to go out on &#8220;cultural&#8221; outings. This may not sound too exciting (although to me it does) so let me explain. Our normal work hours are 8:40 to 4:40, but normal classes (actual school) end at around 2. Cultural outings are times when we can leave after normal classes and go out to do a cultural activity such as watching a movie, having a picnic, or attending a cherry blossom festival! So, the reason I couldn&#8217;t go home was because the teachers were checking their schedules to pick the best date for our trip to the cherry blossom festival, which I am absolutely excited about.</p>\n<p>I love cherry blossoms.</p>\n", "post_id": 210, "location": false, "date": "03-30-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>(by Brian)</p>\n<p>Learning another language is very hard. Today I told a few of my co-workers that I was jealous of them because they are bilingual. Somehow, sometime, they learned to speak English, and they speak it quite well. Sometimes they don&#8217;t understand certain idioms or phrases, but who can blame them? And sometimes they struggle for the right word, but so do I. (We just have different reasons: I&#8217;m trying to find the perfect synonym, to fit in some alliteration, or to make the sentence seem powerful; they are simply trying to communicate.) Overall, however, their English skills are very impressive. Some people I know have co-teachers who can barely speak English. I guess that&#8217;s one benefit of working at a high school. English teachers in high schools had to major in English.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a confession: I often think about other people&#8217;s brains. Specifically, I think about what is going on in their minds. Sometimes, I wake up from whatever it is that I am doing and realize that everyone else also has their own thoughts. At these points, I start to wonder what other people are thinking. I start by thinking of people I know who are closeby but not in visible range. Then I wonder about people in other countries. I wonder about people who are sleeping because they are on the other side of the world. I wonder about people who are eating, or playing, and I sadly think about people who are probably at that time dying or being raped or burying a loved one. And for all of these things, I wonder what people think about them.</p>\n<p>But even though I&#8217;d often thought about people having experiences that were different than the ones I&#8217;d been having, I didn&#8217;t often consider that they way they thought about these things was probably not in English. When I walk down the street in Korea and look at any given person, I sometimes think to myself, &#8220;Wow, that person is thinking in Korean.&#8221; It&#8217;s significant because, for one, it&#8217;s another language. They do not think, &#8220;Oh, I hope I catch the bus on time.&#8221; No, they think something else. For another, languages have different grammars and patterns, and with those different grammars and patterns come different ways of thinking.</p>\n<p>When I was younger I used to think speaking another language was impressive. I don&#8217;t mean speaking one language, and then speaking another language on top of it. I mean speaking another language. I used to think, &#8220;Wow, they have to translate that into/from English and then say it.&#8221; I know that is absurd now, but I still have to remind myself that to people who don&#8217;t speak English, what they say and hear makes sense. And of course we studied this stuff as English majors, but it&#8217;s different to experience it first hand.</p>\n<p>Part of learning a language is thinking in that language. There&#8217;s a difference between knowing words in a language and knowing the language. It&#8217;s very difficult. We get so used to asking, &#8220;How do you say, &#8216;I want some nachos&#8217; in Korean?&#8221; The answer is you don&#8217;t. If you say, &#8220;I want some nachos,&#8221; you are not speaking Korean. You might say, &#8220;Duh, Brian, you typed that in English.&#8221;</p>\n<p>No. What I am trying to say is this: \uc548\ub155\ud558\uc138\uc694 does not mean &#8220;Hello&#8221; in Korean. It means \uc548\ub155\ud558\uc138\uc694*. The same goes for pretty much anything else you can say in Korean. So it&#8217;s very difficult to learn a language if you constantly compare it to another one. Yet how can you learn it without doing that? Sometimes it&#8217;s necessary, but it cannot work by translating an entire vocabulary.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s hard. But I&#8217;m glad to say that, with a few words and phrases, at least, I know only what the Korean means. Okay, somewhat. For example, we learned how to tell time in Korean. You say the hour in the pure Korean number system, followed by \uc2dc, which means hour. Then you say the minute in the Sino-Korean number system, followed by \ubd84, which means minute. After only a few days at our apartment, I noticed lots of convenience stores and other places had &#8220;24 \uc2dc\uac04&#8221; on their signs. I eventually realized that it means they were open all day long. I don&#8217;t know the exact translation, and I&#8217;m glad. It has helped me adapt my understanding, so that when I saw \uc2dc\uac04 in another context, I could realize it didn&#8217;t only mean &#8220;hours a day.&#8221; And I see \ubd84 enough that I don&#8217;t even have to think about what it means.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve also learned dates without having to translate in my head. Of course, half of it is numbers, but one day I saw &#8220;3 \uc6d4 25 \uc77c&#8221; and knew instantly that it meant March 25.</p>\n<p>I think my greatest internalization of Korean is what they say to express gratitude. To say thanks, Koreans say \uac10\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. A few weeks ago, I sat at the cafeteria lunch table, inclined my head, closed my eyes, and the first word that came to my mind, instead of &#8220;Thank you, Father&#8230;&#8221; was \uac10\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. Took me by surprise. A student also handed me a sheet of paper one day and I automatically said \uac10\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4, which made her and her nearby classmates laugh and gasp. Of course, I apologized for speaking Korean in English class&#8230;.</p>\n<p>But all of this is very small. I still have a long way to go.</p>\n<p>*No, really. \uc548\ub155 &#8220;means&#8221; well-being, peace, etc. \ud558\uc138\uc694 &#8220;means&#8221; do you?, you do, please do, etc. Not one of those words is &#8220;hello.&#8221;</p>\n", "post_id": 217, "location": false, "date": "04-01-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>(by Brian)</p>\n<p>Some things are different in Korea. Most of them are neutral, although you or I may have opinions regarding the superiority of one way or another. Ashley and I have both written blogs about <a href=\"http://129degreeseast.wordpress.com/2011/02/26/5-reasons-i-like-korea/\">why we</a> like <a href=\"http://129degreeseast.wordpress.com/2011/03/20/166/\">Korea</a>, and now I&#8217;d like to tell you some things that are different, but that aren&#8217;t necessarily advertisements for Korean tourism. I like some of the differences, but I wouldn&#8217;t say they&#8217;re reasons to visit. They are simply things that Koreans do that Americans and other Westerners don&#8217;t, or vice-versa, such as&#8230;</p>\n<p><strong>Using Chopsticks</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, big surprise. You know this already. Pretty much any East Asian country uses chopsticks for eating. But Koreans use a different kind of chopsticks. Although chopsticks are made of various materials (especially when people start getting fancy and make them out of ivory or silver), most of them are wooden or bamboo. Koreans, however, use metal chopsticks, and they are the only people who use metal chopsticks as the norm.</p>\n<p>Not only are the chopsticks metal, but they are also flat. While you might see round bamboo chopsticks or square-sided wooden chopsticks, the metal chopsticks of Korea are relatively flat.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone\" title=\"Types of Chopsticks\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/Many-chopsticks.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" /></p>\n<p>Notice the metal chopsticks in the middle. They are flatter than the other pairs. So not only is Korea different from Western societies by using chopsticks, the country is also different from other Asian countries by choosing a different material. And also by&#8230;</p>\n<p><strong>Using a Spoon</strong></p>\n<p>You probably noticed the spoon in the above picture. That&#8217;s because Korea is also the only Asian country to eat rice and soup with a spoon. Every one else uses chopsticks for rice, and I <em>think</em> that they bring their bowls to their faces for the liquid part of soup. In Korea, though, it&#8217;s impolite to drink your soup directly from the bowl (at least traditionally, although I think I&#8217;ve seen people do it more often now, especially for the last sips), so you can use a spoon. Also for the rice, too.\u00a0 So this one isn&#8217;t so different at all, except in the length of the spoon. I think the picture above does not adequately represent a typical Korean rice-and-soup spoon. The ones I see and use here have very long handles, maybe 2 inches longer than the one in the picture. Probably for all of the side dish-sharing that goes on at traditional Korean meals.</p>\n<p>I used to think using a spoon was chosen as the &#8220;easy way out,&#8221; but it&#8217;s probably more likely just because it makes more sense (and, again, the soup thing). It&#8217;s not that Koreans can&#8217;t eat rice with chopsticks. They can. I&#8217;ve seen them do it. And I&#8217;ve also seen them eat fish with chopsticks. I&#8217;m talking about whole grilled fish, and they use the chopsticks to remove the head and the tiny little bones. Sure, sometimes I see a co-worker hold down the fish with one hand while tearing it apart with the chopsticks. But many don&#8217;t need to. My primary co-teacher, for example, only uses one hand, and before I can blink, she has removed the bones from her bite of fish. Once I can eat fish with chopsticks, I will consider myself a chopsticks master.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s one more eating utensil that Koreans use. It might shock you to find out about&#8230;</p>\n<p><strong>Using a Pair of Scissors</strong></p>\n<p>Yes. A pair of scissors. I don&#8217;t know the exact reason for it, but I&#8217;m going to guess that it has something to do with Confucius. The ideas of Confucius are still very popular in Korea, and he said that it was dishonorable to have a knife at the dinner table. The idea is that knives are for fighting and slaughter, not for dining. This idea is a large reason for the use of chopsticks in Asian countries, and I have a feeling that it also influenced someone, at some point, to cut food at the table with a pair of scissors rather than with a knife.</p>\n<p>Anytime you go to a restaurant and they bring you a plate of meat to grill on your table&#8217;s barbecue grill, they will also give you a pair of scissors to cut the meat as or after you cook it. You also use it to cut up any vegetables you may have or even the noodles in your soup (if they are the kind of noodles you need to cut right away, lest they stick together in one massive ball of noodles).</p>\n<p>Or maybe Koreans just use scissors because, hey, no cutting board required. It&#8217;s pretty easy. I think a lot of things in Korea are designed to be easy. Except&#8230;</p>\n<p><strong>Doing Laundry</strong></p>\n<p>Most Koreans don&#8217;t own a dryer. I&#8217;ve heard that some Guest English Teachers have washers that double as dryers (how cool is that?), but most people have to hang their clothes up to dry. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s an energy conservation thing, or a money-saving thing, or if Koreans just like clothesline apparel, but they hang up laundry on racks for drying. Our rack hangs from the laundry area ceiling.</p>\n<p>Hanging stuff up to dry is nice in a way, because once it&#8217;s hanging, you can leave it there and not have to put the clothes in their proper places right away. With dryers, you have to fold and put away the clothes as soon as possible. The downside is, you still have to hang up the clothes right away. And it&#8217;s a time-consuming process, especially with socks and underwear. But sometimes, if the clothes need to be dry sooner, you can put them on the floor, and the ondol heating system will speed up the process, if you have it turned on.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll notice now that my transitions are getting weaker. So I&#8217;m not even going to pretend I have a good one this time. I&#8217;m just going to jump to&#8230;</p>\n<p><strong>Using Toilet Paper</strong></p>\n<p>Oh, no, what am I going to say now? Koreans <em>do</em> use toilet paper, right? Yes, of course they do. But it&#8217;s a bit different, mainly for two reasons. The first reason is what to do with toilet paper <em>before</em> using the restroom. Here is the answer: obtain it. If you&#8217;re going out in public, it&#8217;s a good idea to carry some with you. Not all bathrooms are well-stocked, and I&#8217;m sure you would hate to learn that the hard way.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, though, there might not be toilet paper in the bathroom stalls themselves, but near the sink there will be a toilet paper dispenser. One of those ones that dispense the 1-ply, non-perforated rolls. I think at first, many foreigners I know thought that Koreans had a strange concept of drying hands. But I think the answer is actually that you pull a few feet from the dispenser before going into the bathroom stall. I guess that makes checking and changing the roll easier. Oh, and you can use it to dry your hands, too.</p>\n<p>The other difference, which I&#8217;m sure you could guess if you caught onto my clue earlier, regards what to do <em>after</em> using the restroom. Here is the answer: throw away your toilet paper. You don&#8217;t flush toilet paper in Korea, especially in public facilities, where the higher volume of waste means pipes are more likely to clog.</p>\n<p>I could tell you an advantage to this practice, but it might be a little bit too much information. So I&#8217;ll spare you and move onto another difference, which is&#8230;</p>\n<p><strong>Not Wearing Sunglasses</strong></p>\n<p>Koreans hardly ever wear sunglasses, from what one of my co-teachers told me. Apparently some students were asking her why I wear sunglasses. She told me that only certain people wear them at certain times and that it&#8217;s not very common. I often forget that my glasses change tint in sunlight, and even after my co-teacher provided that piece of cultural information, I still forget. I wonder sometimes if my dark shades keep Koreans from seeing my eyes and, thus, from thinking that I&#8217;m a respectful<strong></strong> American. I&#8217;d better be, because in Korea, people are concerned with&#8230;</p>\n<p><strong>Keeping a Reputation</strong></p>\n<p>Most countries, including America, have slander and libel laws. Basically, a person or organization can sue you if you tarnish their reputation with spoken or written words, unless you can prove that your words were true. In Korea, that last part doesn&#8217;t apply. You could be found liable to pay the plaintiff even if everything you said was accurate and without exaggeration, but still highly damaging to the plaintiff&#8217;s reputation. I&#8217;ve read that foreign teachers have gotten into trouble because they did not know this law before making public statements regarding the unprofessional practices of certain hagwons (private, after-school academies). The teachers thought of the public statements as warnings to potential job applicants. The hagwons and the government thought of them as reputation destroyers.</p>\n<p>Why? Because in Korea, reputation is important, and it&#8217;s reflected in the country&#8217;s slander and libel laws. (But it&#8217;s also reflected in positive things, don&#8217;t get me wrong.)</p>\n<p>Well, I think that&#8217;s it for now. I feel like there should be more. There probably will be more.</p>\n", "post_id": 227, "location": false, "date": "04-06-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>(by Brian)</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s time to discuss a touchy subject. I did not want to write about it because I did not want people being scared.</p>\n<p>Japan.</p>\n<p>I was surprised to find out, when I came to Korea, that Japan and Korea aren&#8217;t exactly the best of friends. Before coming, I thought that they were friendly nations. The United States likes both of the countries, overall, and there are so many things that the two countries have in common, that they have shared with or borrowed from each other. For example, sushi, from Japan, is popular in Korea and influenced the creation of Korean gimbap. And ferries between the two countries promote tourism and weekend visits between both nations.</p>\n<p>And gosh, they&#8217;re just so darn close to each other.</p>\n<p>But apparently there is still some resentment remaining from the time Japan occupied Korea, from 1910 to 1945. And also from the Japanese military&#8217;s use of some Korean women during that time as &#8220;comfort women&#8221; (I&#8217;m sure you can guess what it means). I wouldn&#8217;t say that Japan and Korea are enemies, but there is definitely tension. Today, it is best shown by their argument regarding the ownership of some very small islands. Japan says the islands belong to them. Korea claims them for itself. Who really owns them? I haven&#8217;t really looked into it. But it seems to be a fairly big deal to both countries, at least politically (ownership of the islands indicates what part of the ocean can be fished as domestic and what parts require international trade).</p>\n<p>So I was quite shocked to find all of this out. But I was also warmed by the general Korean reaction to the triple catastrophe in Japan nearly a month ago. According to the news, organizations and clubs that normally met to vent emotions regarding the Japanese occupation or the comfort women, either met to pray for Japan or postponed their meetings. Some of these groups are made of survivors of the occupation, or former comfort women, so it was kind of a big gesture. One night I saw a large gathering of very sad-looking people holding candles and signs reading &#8220;Pray for Japan.&#8221; So the animosity isn&#8217;t <em>too</em> deep.</p>\n<p>Anyway (yeah, the above was me getting off-topic before I even began), nearly a month ago, Japan got hit by a 9.0 earthquake, which is pretty strong. And by &#8220;pretty strong,&#8221; I mean, &#8220;OH LORD SAVE US!&#8221; strong. That earthquake created a tsunami, which, guess what, headed right back for Japan. And those two disasters struck a few nuclear reactors on the East coast of Japan.</p>\n<p>So people have naturally been worried about us. Heck, I&#8217;ve been worried about us too. But I think we&#8217;ll be fine.</p>\n<p>A lot of foreigners were expressing concerns on Facebook and Waygook.org (a site for foreigners in Korea and other Asian countries, usually the foreigners who happen to teach English) about the potential for a nuclear catastrophe affecting Korea. People were basically asking, &#8220;Should I be ready for a midnight run?&#8221; There was chaos for a while. Different people were providing their opinions. Sometimes they actually knew what they were talking about, too. The Korean newspapers (the <a href=\"http://www.koreatimes.co.kr\">ones I can read</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.koreaherald.com\">ones in English</a>) were filled with reports about citizens in a general panic about what could happen. (Oddly, I never saw it in person until today&#8230;more on that later.)</p>\n<p>And yeah, I was in a bit of a panic, too. Inwardly, of course, but I worried nonetheless. Would we have to leave the country to flee from the possibility of getting so much radiation poisoning that staying would be stupid? I did not want to do that. I like it here. Plus, leaving would mean violating our contracts, which would have some pretty bad consequences for us.</p>\n<p>So I kept reading the news. Everything looked relatively okay. Most experts reassured everyone that Japan&#8217;s reactors were safer than the ones in Chernobyl. Even if the worst happened, it would be confined to a relatively small area. A few experts disagreed and said that it could be terrible, but I think even then they were talking in terms of the survival of Japan (as in, the worst case scenario would be, &#8220;Oh wow, Japan is DEAD&#8221;). Even when the reports said that the nuclear plants were having radiation levels beyond the legal limit, places ten or twenty miles away were barely feeling any differences, so the drop-off rate is pretty good at the moment. And the most popular opinion was that, even if Japan&#8217;s reactors melted down to the worst scenario, the seasonal wind patterns would blow the radiation to the Pacific Ocean, and not toward the Korean Peninsula.</p>\n<p>But apparently, increased levels of radiation have been found all over the world, but it&#8217;s still not enough to pose a serious threat. People are exposed to radiation every day. It comes from the sky, it comes from the ground, and it even comes from our bodies. And that amount that Japan gave to the world is still fairly small in comparison. It&#8217;s only the area immediately around the nuclear plants that will probably see some long-term damage.</p>\n<p>I saw a site that displayed the radiation measurements for Japan and Korea. In Busan, the measurement was .0025 mSv/hr (millisieverts per hour). That is .9125 mSv/yr. And that number is still lower than the average yearly exposure.</p>\n<p>Two days ago, people started saying on the news that today&#8217;s rain (Thursday) would include radiation from Japan. Even though the prevailing winds are going toward Japan (and not the other way around), air weather forecasters predicted a current from the nuclear plants to go southeast today. What was southeast of the plant? A clockwise current that <em>was</em> headed west, in our direction. So the fear was that the radiation would travel southeast and then west, along a clockwise pattern, into Korea. And if it rained, that means the radiation would pour down on us.</p>\n<p>So, many people were afraid. But by the time I heard about it and looked online for the reports, the weather data had been merged with the radiation data to show that the amount of radiation that would actually still remain by the time it arrived would be almost nothing. Not nothing, but almost nothing.</p>\n<p>Still, I wore my biggest jacket and took an umbrella to work today. It was only drizzling, which would diminish the effects, but still.</p>\n<p>And when I got to work, I checked the news. The forecasters were wrong. The air from the nuclear plant headed northeast. So it didn&#8217;t come near us at all. So in the first few classes of my day, some of my students were expressing fears. I asked them how they were feeling this morning, and they said, &#8220;Not good,&#8221; or, &#8220;Bad,&#8221; and so on. Some said, &#8220;Rain bad.&#8221; Some said, &#8220;Japan rain.&#8221; And so on. So I told them what I had learned on the news and we started class.</p>\n<p>I think the most concerning thing is the oceans and the effect of radiation on the food chain. Fish, seaweed, and seafood are primary parts of the Korea diet. Japan had to dump some radiated water into the ocean to prevent some worse consequences (if I understand correctly, they needed to make room to store even more dangerous water, or to keep water flowing to cool down the reactors&#8230;or something). So that&#8217;s not cool. But again, this is on the side of Japan opposite Korea, and it&#8217;s several hundred miles away. Also, even before this dumping took place, Korea started checking radiation levels on the food being brought into the country from the waters.</p>\n<p>So for now, I think we&#8217;re alright. Of <em>course</em> I will let you know if we aren&#8217;t (and in that case, you will probably know when we&#8217;re suddenly back in the United States).</p>\n", "post_id": 237, "location": false, "date": "04-07-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>In Korea I see and hear many things that are strange and interesting to me. Some things I like quite a bit. \u00a0For instance, I like the way that you can buy fresh fruits and vegetables on street corners.</p>\n<p>One Sunday we visited Mr. Lee&#8217;s church, and afterward he took us to his home for tea and snacks. On the way there, his wife rolled down the driver&#8217;s side window and shouted &#8220;<em>Ajumma, <strong>ddalgi </strong>juseo</em>&#8221; or something like that. So the woman working at the little corner shop rushed over, around some other cars, and brought the tray of strawberries to us. Mr. Lee&#8217;s wife handed the money out the window and we continued our drive. The whole process took less than a minute. I also like the sound of the fruit and vegetable trucks. These trucks are equipped with loud-speakers and they drive slowly down the street chanting their wares until, presumably, someone hails them to buy some produce. I think the chanting of these trucks is an excellent way for me to remember the Korean names for fruit and vegetables. I&#8217;ve already got\u00a0cabbage (<em>baechu</em>) and strawberry (<em>ddalgi</em>)\u00a0down pat.</p>\n<p>And speaking of strawberries&#8230;they taste sweeter in Korea.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 445px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img title=\"Korean Strawberries\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/chekyang.com/musings/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/blog-strawberries-p1000506.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"435\" height=\"330\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">I took my own pictures, but something happened to my camera files!</p></div>\n<p>I thought they were in season, because you can buy them anywhere and everywhere. Apparently they&#8217;re not. I&#8217;m told they will be cheaper when the season comes (ignorant me thought they were already well-priced). Korean strawberries, however out of season they may be right now, taste amazing. They are sweet and delicious. Even the strawberries that have less red coloring are juicy and sweet. For some reason, too, the strawberries all have an elongated shape. In the US, we have many strange and different shapes of strawberry, in Korea, there is only one.</p>\n<p>In Korea, many older married women (<em>ajumma</em>) sell the strawberries. They also sell melons and persimmons at fruit stands, and, in the fish market, they sell fish. Interestingly, on one of my trips to Jagalchi fish market, which is a wonderful experience, some actually\u00a0<em>ajumma </em>came out from behind their booth to touch my hair and say things about it in Korean that I didn&#8217;t understand. I was a little surprised. Anyway, \u00a0I see them on almost every corner sitting with their vegetables, roots and herbs on the side of the street, or in the subway station. \u00a0I see many grandmothers\u00a0(<em>halmeoni</em>)\u00a0and grandfathers (<em>halabeoji</em>) \u00a0climbing the steep stairs out of the subway.</p>\n<p>In Korea it seems, slow and steady wins the race. Even young people approach an incline with slow, steady pacing. \u00a0Korean people, young and old, often clasp both hands behind their backs when they walk this way, which gives the appearance of stateliness and determination.</p>\n<p>In the morning, on my way to work, I see children running. Korea is a safe country, for the most part. So, even I feel safe walking alone in the city and that&#8217;s a first for me. In the mornings, the children often walk alone to school or in pairs. Sometimes I see a mom watching from the top of a hill shading her eyes with her hands as her child makes his way to school. I love it when the children walk in pairs. The older sibling clearly was told to keep hold of their younger brother or sister. I see them gripping their sibling by the backpack or by the hand, as the smaller one tries earnestly to get away from them.</p>\n<p>Another thing I notice here in Korea is how Confucian thought has really impacted this country. As Brian has mentioned before, in Korea image is very important. So, too, is status. One type of status comes from age, and this status marker is very respected and \u00a0ingrained.</p>\n<p>Growing up, I was taught the importance of respecting my elders, asking &#8220;May I vs. Can I&#8221; answering &#8220;Yes&#8221; instead of &#8220;What&#8221; when an elder called my name from another room and the list goes on. One specific way that I was taught to respect my elders was by calling them Mr. and Mrs. SoandSo, or Brother and Sister SoandSo (at church), or Pastor or Dr. Soandso, Aunt and Uncle Soandso for aunts, uncles and family friends; even Cousin Soandso if they are 2nd cousins of my parent&#8217;s generation. This upbringing remained deep within me until I was about 20 years old. So much was it a part of me that I felt uncomfortable calling adults by just their first name, even after their\u00a0insistence that that was what they wanted. It was a strange and painful thing for me to get used to. And I still want to, and still will, call people by the title&#8217;s I&#8217;ve called them all my life&#8230;until they tell me otherwise.</p>\n<p>In Korea, they have a similar method of paying respect to elders. In fact, you can&#8217;t even use the same words when talking to elders. And, in Korea, they even expand the definition of elder take it a bit further than I&#8217;m used to. This is how it goes: Everyone born in the same year is the same age, and so these are your casual &#8220;friend group&#8221; type people. My orientation Korean class teacher (Amy Teacher) told me on the last day that we were friends because we were both born in 1986. Anyone younger is your subordinate, or younger sibling type and\u00a0<em>anyone </em>older than you is referred to by title. Even older siblings and schoolmates.</p>\n<p>In my case, I am a firstborn child, so I would have the privilege of calling my siblings by their given names . In their cases, however, they would <em>have </em>to call me &#8220;Older sister&#8221;&#8211;<em>Eonni </em>for Ang, or <em>nuna </em>for Jon since the titles are based on gender of the younger sibling. If they called me by name, or even if they called my school friends by name, it would be very shocking and frowned upon. ((I think maybe my brother, Jon, is a pupil of Confucius at heart. When he was young he always called me and Angela, &#8220;Sisters&#8221; \u00a0instead of saying our names lol)).</p>\n<p>Anyway, I knew about the name thing before I came to Korea, but I was able to realize it more fully one day in class when we were watching a video for the 4th grade lesson. I teach several different classes of 4th graders and for some reason each time we watched this video all the kids gasped in shock and surprise when the little cartoon girl said to her older brother&#8217;s friend &#8220;Hello, Anne.&#8221; Thus, I have heard younger students calling older students &#8220;<em>Eonni</em>&#8221; even if they are not sisters, and even adults do this with their friends. As an older sister, I don&#8217;t mind this practice. \u00a0I do, however, think it&#8217;s strange that young women will call their boyfriends &#8220;older brother&#8221; (<em>Oppa</em>).</p>\n<p>All in all, \u00a0I really like my new title of teacher (<em>seonsaengnim</em>). I like being called Ashley Teacher&#8211;more phonetically, &#8220;Eshulee Teach-uh&#8221; or even &#8220;Eshulee Sun-seng-nim.&#8221; I especially enjoy the &#8220;<em>nim</em>&#8221; honorific at the end.</p>\n<p>Because in Korea, being a teacher is an honored and respected position. Call me crazy, but I like being honored and respected.</p>\n<p>Actually, just call me Ashley Teacher.</p>\n", "post_id": 240, "location": false, "date": "04-08-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>In Korea, my age is 28, and I&#8217;ve been 28 for more than 80 days. By American standards, I just turned 27 from 26 a few days ago. That means I had a difference of two between the different age reckonings for almost three months. This kind of thing has made me hesitate whenever someone asks my age. I think, <em>What&#8217;s my age again?</em> I&#8217;ve thought about it enough that now I know my age, but for a time I was confused.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s kind of peculiar, the way Koreans count ages. When you are born, your age is one. When the next calendar year comes, you&#8217;re two. And when the next calendar year comes, you&#8217;re three. This is how all of the students in a grade are the same age (usually). One day I asked some students how old they were. When I asked the other students in the class, they said, &#8220;Teacher, we are <em>all</em> nine years old.&#8221; Or maybe it was ten. It didn&#8217;t matter if they&#8217;d had a birthday already or if they were waiting for one. They were the same age. Of course, many Koreans today still celebrate their birthdays and have small parties and eat cake (although traditionally, the important birthdays in Korea were the 100-day, one-year, and sixty-year birthdays). It&#8217;s just that their ages don&#8217;t change at that time, unless a person&#8217;s birthday is January 1. I think that traditionally, the age changed at the lunar new year, but nowadays it seems they count it by the solar new year.</p>\n<p>This way of counting ages makes it possible for a one-day-old baby to be two years old. Born on December 31? You&#8217;re one. January 1 comes along and now you&#8217;re two. It sounds like an offense to numbers and it&#8217;s hard for Westerners to wrap their minds around it, but I&#8217;ve come to think of it not as cardinal years, but as ordinal years. When an American says he&#8217;s 30 years old, he has completed 30 years of life. I suspect that the reasoning behind Korean reckoning is that a 30-year-old man is <em>on</em> his 30th year of life. A six-month-old baby isn&#8217;t one year old yet, but is living in the first year of life. Then tweak the definition slightly more. The man is 28, but he&#8217;s on the 30th <em>calendar</em> year of his life. If you count how many calendar years he&#8217;s lived in, from 1984 to 2013, you&#8217;d count 30 numbers, even if he only lived four months in 1984 and three so far in 2013.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know if my assumptions are valid, but this is how I make sense of the Korean system.</p>\n<p>So I turned 27 (while remaining 28) three days ago. And my students were so nice to me. I had a great two days. Even before my birthday, some of the students were excited. A student in one class had his birthday yesterday, two days after mine. He said every day, &#8220;Teacher, your birthday is 21 and my birthday is 23.&#8221; A student in another class&#8217;s birthday is on the 31st, and he also reminded me in a similar fashion.</p>\n<p>Ashley gave me a good idea that I should give all my students a small treat, like a chocolate, for my birthday. I liked that idea, so I went to the store and bought packs of individually wrapped chocolates. Actually, I got a pretty good deal.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of class, after I asked the class what day it was and wrote it on the board (&#8220;Today is Thursday, March 21, 2013&#8243;), I asked them if they knew what today was. In some classes, the students all knew. They had asked me my birthday before (because I had all my students write their birthdays and favorite colors and favorite foods on a chart a couple of weeks ago). In other classes, the students probably only suspected that I was pulling another corny joke. A few times in previous classes I had asked the students if they knew why today was a special day. When they had finally given up, I told them it was because &#8220;Today is today.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But this particular &#8220;today&#8221; was my birthday. So I told my students, &#8220;Today is my birthday. So I bought myself some chocolate. And I&#8217;m going to eat it.&#8221; The students groaned and expressed their hungry jealousy. In one class I actually unwrapped a piece and ate it. But then I told them, &#8220;But I want to share it with you.&#8221; So I gave every student a piece.</p>\n<p>I have four classes on Thursdays, plus &#8220;After School Program&#8221; (ASP, or, as we sometimes call it, ASB for &#8220;After School Babysitting&#8221;). I teach first, second, third, and fourth period on Thursdays, and eighth period for ASP. And I really enjoyed those classes. The students participated well and were generally well-behaved.</p>\n<p>In my first class of the day, when I said it was my birthday, one of my students said, &#8220;Really?&#8221; Then she opened her pencil case, took out a pen, and brought it to me.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/2013-03-23-09-16-03.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image aligncenter\" id=\"i-2547\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/2013-03-23-09-16-03.jpg?w=520&#038;h=390\" width=\"520\" height=\"390\" /></a>In other classes, students gave me Hershey&#8217;s kisses or suckers.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/2013-03-23-09-15-50.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image aligncenter\" id=\"i-2551\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/2013-03-23-09-15-50.jpg?w=520&#038;h=390\" width=\"520\" height=\"390\" /></a>And I really enjoyed my birthday. A few days before, a student who knows I can solve a Rubik&#8217;s Cube asked me to solve one for her, so I did. I suspect it belongs to one of her relatives. She came to me on my birthday and asked me to solve two more cubes. One was normal, but the other, well, the other looked like this:</p>\n<p><div style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/fisherscube.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image \" id=\"i-2563\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/fisherscube.jpg?w=490&#038;h=368\" width=\"490\" height=\"368\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a title=\"Not my picture.\" href=\"http://msscoventry.freehostia.com/Builds/FisherCubeBuild.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Not my picture.</a></p></div>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">So when I had some free time in the afternoon, I attempted to solve that one. I was dumbfounded for quite some time, until I realized that it does indeed take the shape of a cube when solved. I tried to solve it on my own and made small progress. If it were my cube, I probably would have taken a few more days or weeks before breaking down and reading tips on the Internet. But I had to give this back to my student the next day. (Of course, when I gave it back to her on Friday, I didn&#8217;t tell her that I cheated.)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Some of my students on Wednesday had said to me, &#8220;I&#8217;ll bring you a present tomorrow,&#8221; or they said it on Thursday. I told them, &#8220;Oh that&#8217;s so nice, but you don&#8217;t have to.&#8221; There&#8217;s one who is new to our school and who lived in Berrien Springs for the past two years. On Thursday after school (she doesn&#8217;t have my class on Thursdays), she came to me and said she was going to bring me a gift the next day. When I said I didn&#8217;t expect that, that she didn&#8217;t have to do that, she cutely said, &#8220;I NEED TO!&#8221; On Friday she saw me in the hallway before lunch and had me follow her to her main classroom so she could give me the present. She said, &#8220;There&#8217;s two, but one&#8217;s in Korean.&#8221; I thought, &#8220;Oh, how nice. She knows I like learning Korean.&#8221; So she gave me some children&#8217;s devotional books. Actually, I think the Korean one will help me learn more Korean, and the English one might be good for Sabbath school and whatnot.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/2013-03-23-09-15-30.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image aligncenter\" id=\"i-2577\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/2013-03-23-09-15-30.jpg?w=520&#038;h=390\" width=\"520\" height=\"390\" /></a>On Thursday morning, two of my students, sisters from the second and third grades, came to the English teachers&#8217; office before classes started and smilingly gave me this:</p>\n<p><div style=\"width: 530px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/2013-03-22-08-21-50.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image \" id=\"i-2587\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/2013-03-22-08-21-50.jpg?w=520&#038;h=390\" width=\"520\" height=\"390\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The roll cake and the plaid stuffed rabbit. (The pen is the same one from before, not part of these particular students&#8217; gift.)</p></div>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I was very touched. Teacher Heather said the students must really love me, that the other teachers don&#8217;t get such nice gifts. But they do. Ashley got quite a few gifts and cards on her birthday. She got a nice ceramic cup that has a smiling face and says, &#8220;THIS IS NOT A PAPER CUP&#8221; But it does seem like they were a little excessive for me. Maybe it&#8217;s because it&#8217;s the beginning of the school year, so they&#8217;re full of energy.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I also gave a piece of chocolate on Friday to the students who didn&#8217;t have classes with me on Thursday. A student from one of these two classes wrote me a nice little note, although it was full of lies:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/2013-03-23-09-15-02.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image aligncenter\" id=\"i-2595\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/2013-03-23-09-15-02.jpg?w=520&#038;h=390\" width=\"520\" height=\"390\" /></a>She says that she doesn&#8217;t study in class but only plays, but that&#8217;s not true. She&#8217;s not one of the smartest students in her grade when it comes to English class, but she&#8217;s in the low-level classes, she&#8217;s one of the smartest students. She participates more than the average student. She&#8217;s also very polite and friendly.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Finally, for my last class of the day, sixth period, I had the most intense birthday class ever. First, I was in the English teachers&#8217; office switching books and materials from fourth-and-fifth-grade conversation class to third-grade language arts class. As I was about to leave the room to go to class, one of my students stood in the doorway and told me not to go to class. Sometimes the students do this so they aren&#8217;t considered late by reason of being in class before the teacher is. But when she continued to block my way I saw what she was up to. Nonetheless, I played along. I walked, with her putting her hands out to keep me from moving forward. I walked, and she slowly slid backwards. We neared the water dispenser and she told me to have a drink. &#8220;Well, I am kind of thirsty,&#8221; I said, and took a drink of water. Then some other student down the hall called out something and then my student said, &#8220;Okay, you can go to class now.&#8221; So we went to the classroom, where the students jumped out from behind the TV and from under desks and from behind the door and said, &#8220;Happy birthday!&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">And they had things drawn on the white board. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/2013-03-22-13-52-55.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image aligncenter\" id=\"i-2617\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/2013-03-22-13-52-55.jpg?w=520&#038;h=309\" width=\"520\" height=\"309\" /></a>When I went to take a picture of it, most of the students ran to the front of the classroom to be in the picture. Of course, they wanted me in it, too, so one of the boys who didn&#8217;t want to be in the picture took it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/2013-03-22-13-20-46.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image\" id=\"i-2620\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/2013-03-22-13-20-46.jpg?w=650\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">My students made me feel so special.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">On Thursday nights, we go to Korean class. Our friend Linda surprised me by meeting us at the bus stop with a cake. That turned out to be why Ashley said she didn&#8217;t feel like bringing snacks to class, like she had previously suggested. So for the last thirty minutes of Korean class, the five of us (four students and the Korean teacher, although sometimes there are more students who show up) ate cake and drank Milkis (a Korean milk soda that I&#8217;m quite fond of).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/2013-03-21-20-36-422.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image aligncenter\" id=\"i-2639\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/2013-03-21-20-36-422.jpg?w=520&#038;h=390\" width=\"520\" height=\"390\" /></a><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/13640996788311.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image aligncenter\" id=\"i-2641\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/13640996788311.jpg?w=520&#038;h=390\" width=\"520\" height=\"390\" /></a>And when we came home, toward the end of my birthday (by Korean time), my sister got on Skype so I could talk to her and two of my three nieces for a few minutes. (At the time, it was Friday morning in Michigan, so I suspect my eldest niece was at school.)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/skype.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image\" id=\"i-2645\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/skype.jpg?w=650\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">And they made a birthday cookie:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/ec82acebb3b8-901228_584659501367_1630883612_o.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image\" id=\"i-2648\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/ec82acebb3b8-901228_584659501367_1630883612_o.jpg?w=650\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I hope they ate it. ^_^</p>\n", "post_id": 2418, "location": false, "date": "03-24-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>(by Brian)</p>\n<p>Ashley and I went on our second hike today. There&#8217;s a mountain next to our apartment complex called \ubc31\uc591\uc0b0 (Baekyangsan), and it has a nice hiking path. But just so you don&#8217;t get disappointed later, I&#8217;ll tell you now that we did not reach the top. So, lower your expectations.</p>\n<p>Done? Good. You may continue reading.</p>\n<p>First we ate a couple of packets of instant oatmeal that we brought with us to Korea. We were low on groceries (we had some frozen vegetables, of course, but not much else), so we settled for a bit of oats. We also did some laundry so that our clothes would have plenty of time to dry before tomorrow (remember, we only have a drying rack). And then we left. First we stopped by a convenience store to get a few snacks so we wouldn&#8217;t feel starved. We also had bottles of water.

There was even a dirt road. I don&#8217;t think many, if any, cars drive on it, but we saw a bike. An old man near a tent in this clearing (I think the tent is the equivalent of a park ranger cabin, but that&#8217;s only a guess) tried to talk to us. We didn&#8217;t understand what he said except when he pointed up at the looming mound of earth and said, &#8220;Baekyangsan.&#8221; Ashley and I had been awake for several hours and had eaten one packet of instant oatmeal a piece, so we decided then that we would try again some other day. We needed to eat more than the trail snacks we had. And it&#8217;s not like the mountain was far away.</p>\n<p>So we headed back down the mountain. We took a slightly different path, and at one point an elderly couple talked to us and (we think) told us which of two paths was the better one to take. I think we followed their advice (unless they told us not to go that way). It was good advice.</p>\n<p>So we&#8217;ll be up that mountain again a few times at least, and you&#8217;ll get to see more of it if you keep checking this site.</p>\n<p>After that, we went back home and then to a local \uae40\ubc25\ucc9c\uad6d. There are a few types of restaurants in Korea that are staples of Korean cuisine. Two of these eateries are the \uae40\ubc25\ucc9c\uad6d (gimbap cheonguk) and the \uae40\ubc25\ub098\ub77c (gimbap nara). They&#8217;re essentially the same thing: small homestyle restaurants with a few hardcore Koreans who serve up some great tasting Korean food at very decent prices. You can find many of the most famous and common Korean staples at these places. Ashley ordered the \ucc38\uce58\ucc0c\uac1c (chamchi jjigae, or tuna jjigae/stew), and I got a boiling bowl of \uc695\uac1c\uc7a5 (yugkaejang, a <em>very</em> spicy beef stew).</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_256\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/img_1992.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-256\" title=\"IMG_1992\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/img_1992.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Yummy food pictured here. Total price: \u20a98500, aka $7.85.</p></div>\n<p>The food is very good. We paid the equivalent of a trip to McDonald&#8217;s or Taco Bell and had food that both tasted better and was better for us. And I wasn&#8217;t lying about the boiling bowl, either. Koreans serve you soup so fresh it&#8217;s still bubbling. I tried to take a picture but it only fogged my camera lens!</p>\n<p>After this we went to a relatively local HomePlus to get some groceries (remember earlier that I said we had no food). HomePlus is like a department store, in a way, that also has an entire floor devoted to being a supermarket. So while the local grocery store will work for most occasions, it&#8217;s nice once in a while to drop by HomePlus. We have to take a cab back, but it&#8217;s very cheap and close to the cost of both of us paying the bus fare, because the HomePlus is not much farther away than the maximum distance the base cab fare (about 2 dollars) can take us.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;d been to HomePlus a few times. We&#8217;ve even bought a few things, but only a few. But today we learned a lot of lessons on what to do at a HomePlus next time we go.</p>\n<p>We got two baskets to fill with groceries because we didn&#8217;t think about carts until we were on the second floor (the grocery floor), and the carts are on the first floor. Oh well, I said, we&#8217;ll use baskets. We did our shopping and then got to the checkout counter. The clerk asked if we wanted bags and I said we&#8217;d just use boxes. (In Korea, they charge you for bags, and I figured it would be sturdier to pack our groceries in recyclable boxes like I saw everyone else doing.)</p>\n<p>But of course, I hadn&#8217;t thought of how to get our groceries to the packing counter. Apparently, the baskets are tagged so you can&#8217;t take them beyond the checkout counter. And I had already denied bags. This moment was when I noticed that everyone at the packing counter also had carts. Carts which were, I remind you, on the floor below. And HomePlus is always a pretty crowded store. And also, for the purpose of finishing this thought regarding the boxes and bags, I skipped something else that had happened.</p>\n<p>The clerk pointed to two bottles of juice we had, one aloe and one grapefruit. He said, &#8220;Buy one get one free.&#8221; The store was very crowded and we also considered saying, &#8220;It&#8217;s okay, we don&#8217;t want to back up the line,&#8221; but that was impossible. Plus it was nice to have four bottles of juice for the price of two. So Ashley went to get two more bottles of juice. And then I finished the transaction and paid for the groceries.</p>\n<p>And, uh, then I waited at the end of the counter with the groceries piled up against the rail. Finally Ashley came back and the very nice clerk added the two bottles of juice to our groceries. Then Ashley and I tried to figure out how to get our groceries to the packing counter. Hmmmmm, I thought. I could guard the groceries while Ashley goes to pack them trip by trip. But that would have been a nightmare.</p>\n<p>So Ashley went downstairs to get a cart. She was followed the whole time, I learned later, by an annoying Korean woman who was probably also certifiably insane. She assumed Ashley was Libyan (probably because of the current events, but that&#8217;s pretty dumb if you ask me) and, when told that she was incorrect, asked which part of Africa Ashley came from.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I came from America,&#8221; Ashley responded.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Well what part of Africa are your parents from?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;My parents were born in America. My grandparents were born in America.&#8221; Seems kind of stupid, and it probably was (as I said, the woman was probably insane, as she told Ashley all sorts of crazy things including about her attempts to <em>build a Lotte Department Store</em>). But since Korea is pretty homogenous, it&#8217;s easy for them to imagine that other countries have similar traits of uniformity. Americans are white, Koreans are Asian, and Africans are black, and so on. It&#8217;s kind of ignorant, but at the same time, pretty much every culture, no matter how &#8220;multicultural,&#8221; is ignorant about other parts of the world or even regions of their own nations. That includes you and me.</p>\n<p>Finally the woman went away and Ashley figured out how to get a cart. You have to put a 100 won coin in to get the cart to unlock it, and you get that coin back when you return the cart. But it wasn&#8217;t obvious, of course. Which means I had to wait quite some time for Ashley to return. Long enough, in fact, for the clerk to feel sorry for me and give me some bags for free. I thanked him and said \uc8c4\uc1a1\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4 (joesonghamnida), but I&#8217;m not sure if he heard that last part, which means, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221; Then I waited for Ashley to come back with a cart. I waited a few minutes, and then we finally left. We learned a lot of very important things during that trip. We probably won&#8217;t go to HomePlus again for a few weeks or so.</p>\n<p>But next time we do, we&#8217;re getting a cart.</p>\n", "post_id": 245, "location": false, "date": "04-10-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>(by Brian)</p>\n<p>Languages are strange. I can&#8217;t help but realize more and more each day just how strange they are, especially once you look at them from a foreigner&#8217;s perspective. When we speak, we don&#8217;t say what we mean. So languages follow one of my favorite principles, the gestalt principle, in that the meanings of the things we say transcend the meanings of the words we use to say them.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 343px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a title=\"Confused Monkey by Michael Keen, on Flickr\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/michaelkeen/3892771349/\"><img title=\"Source: Michael Keen (Creative Commons license)\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/farm4.static.flickr.com/3434/3892771349_0b8c6f5cc7.jpg\" alt=\"Confused Monkey\" width=\"333\" height=\"500\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Wait. What?</p></div>\n<p>The sole solution to such a conundrum, I think, is to communicate eruditely, like this, figuratively separated from casual communication. (The only way to not do it is to speak with big words that aren&#8217;t slang.) But that also has its disadvantages.</p>\n<p>At work, I have to speak simply, and I find it very hard. For much of my life, I thought that my vocabulary level was low. I learned, therefore, how to better understand the meanings of words. Through essay-writing for college courses and having discussions with my friends, I learned differences in the connotations and uses of words that the thesaurus claimed meant the same thing. And so I often choose my words carefully, and sometimes that means also choosing the most impressive word that would fit the occasion (not because I&#8217;m trying to be a show-off, but simply for reasons of verbal economics). See? &#8220;Verbal economics&#8221; was a way of putting into two words what I could have said with 23: choosing the words that I speak in order to let me speak the fewest number of words and with the most precise meaning.</p>\n<p>Now that you&#8217;ve finished counting the words in that last sentence, allow me to continue. I&#8217;m finding out more and more just how difficult my job is. When I first came to Korea and started teaching English to high school girls, I thought I would have to slow down my rate of speech a bit. And I do have to do that. But I also have to choose my words carefully so that my students will understand. I even have to avoid phrases that are made of words they know but that mean something different when you put them together. Which, as I&#8217;m learning, seems to be probably three quarters of the English language.</p>\n<p>Earlier in this post, I said, &#8220;I find it very hard,&#8221; but it doesn&#8217;t mean that. I&#8217;m not <em>finding</em> anything. Even if the word &#8220;find&#8221; is in the dictionary for meaning &#8220;realize,&#8221; it&#8217;s there because of common usage. We say all kinds of things that use words having little to do with what they mean. &#8220;It dawned on me,&#8221; for example, would go over my students&#8217; heads (and maybe even some of my co-workers). We have internalized that metaphor and we take it for granted. Even things that don&#8217;t require metaphors provide difficulty for language learners. One of my students, who seems to be well beyond her peers in English proficiency, asked me what Justin Bieber meant when he sang the phrase, &#8220;You know you love me.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If you look at someone, that person might ask you, &#8220;What?&#8221; as in, &#8220;What are you staring at me for?&#8221; or &#8220;What do you want to say to me?&#8221; In Korea, if you stare at someone, that person might ask you, &#8220;\uc65c?&#8221; which means &#8220;Why?&#8221; as in, &#8220;Why are you looking at me?&#8221; But it means the same (for the situation) as &#8220;What?&#8221; Here&#8217;s another one: I just taught some of my students the phrase &#8220;take up&#8221; as in, &#8220;If I had more free time, I would take up the piano.&#8221; The words &#8220;take&#8221; and &#8220;up&#8221; have little to do with the meaning of the phrase &#8220;take up.&#8221; We have hundreds of phrases like this in English.</p>\n<p>So do you see the problem? If you were a foreigner in Korea and a Korean started staring at you (which is not at all implausible and is, in fact, rather likely), you could not look in your English-Korean dictionary to find the word for &#8220;What?&#8221; Because even though \ubb50? means &#8220;What?&#8221; in Korean, saying \ubb50? does not translate to &#8220;thing to say to someone who is staring at you.&#8221; You couldn&#8217;t tell them about figuring out an answer by translating &#8220;dawned.&#8221; Heck, I think even &#8220;figure it out&#8221; is not quite clear because &#8220;figure&#8221; is a shape or prominent person. &#8220;Shape it out&#8221;? <em>What do you mean?<br />\n</em></p>\n<p>That&#8217;s why people say you have to be able to think in a language in order to be fluent. You can&#8217;t translate words. You have to translate phrases that have similar purposes, not equivalent meanings.</p>\n<p>*Lost in Translation (using words that don&#8217;t quite mean the same as &#8220;lost&#8221; or &#8220;translation&#8221;)</p>\n", "post_id": 263, "location": false, "date": "04-20-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>Last week I posted about my birthday. I had meant to include a few more things in that post, but I forgot them. I was going to make a new post the next day, but this week was one of my most intense and stressful work weeks. I had no time for a post, and I&#8217;m quite glad it&#8217;s over. I&#8217;ll briefly tell you about the things I neglected here, and I&#8217;ll add a couple of other things.</p>\n<p>One thing I meant to say in my post was that in addition to the students treating me so nicely for my birthday, some of my students even treated me well before and after that. With a few exceptions, in a class including some fourth-graders and some fifth-graders, I don&#8217;t teach fifth grade. I teach all of fourth grade. So the fourth-grade students I taught last year, for the most part, don&#8217;t have me as a teacher this year. A few weeks ago, while erasing the whiteboard at the end of a class, some of the fifth graders came into the classroom for their next English class with another teacher. One of the students groaned, &#8220;Teacherrr.&#8221; The tone suggested that he wants me for a teacher again. And he said as much, too. &#8220;Teacher, I like you. Come back.&#8221; Or something like that. Perhaps he doesn&#8217;t really think I&#8217;m a good teacher, but maybe in comparison to his new teacher, or his harder curriculum, he has fond memories.</p>\n<p>And it&#8217;s not just him. I went into that classroom to retrieve my materials before a class started one day and some of the students said, &#8220;Teacher, come back!&#8221; I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s the whole class at all, and again, maybe it&#8217;s because of the new subject (fifth-graders exchange their science class for social studies, but the books we have for &#8220;social studies&#8221; class are more like language arts books*) or a stricter teacher, but such things make me feel good anyway.</p>\n<p>And now for those other things.</p>\n<p><strong>\ub9cc\ub450</strong></p>\n<p>Almost every civilization has some sort of dumpling. In Korea, it&#8217;s called \ub9cc\ub450, or mandu [mahn-doo]. Everyone loves mandu. I love mandu, Ashley loves mandu, we all love mandu. The problem is that all mandu available at the store includes pork, which Ashley and I don&#8217;t like to eat. I remember how upset Ashley was when I learned the word for pork (\ub3fc\uc9c0\uace0\uae30) and saw that the package of mandu in our freezer had that word on it. I went to the store and looked on various packages of mandu to find one without \ub3fc\uc9c0\uace0\uae30 in its ingredients. After I learned more Korean, I asked a store worker if there were any porkless mandu available. The answer was no.</p>\n<p>This means we have two ways of eating mandu. One is to go to the noodle house in town, owned by a Seventh-day Adventist, which serves delicious pheasant mandu (and delicious cold noodles, one of my favorites). The other is to make our own mandu. So we learned how.</p>\n<p>A couple of weeks ago some of the English teachers at my school organically decided to have a Korean-themed potluck-style dinner party. I thought that \ucc38\uce58\ucc0c\uac1c (tuna kimchi stew) or mandu would be a good choice for us to make, but one of our friends, because of her love for cows, doesn&#8217;t eat beef. So I considered some kind of meatless mandu and found a good recipe for cheese mandu on YouTube. I&#8217;m pretty sure cheese mandu is a Westernization. But oh, is it a delicious Westernization.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 530px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/2013-03-19-20-36-50.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image \" id=\"i-2750\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/2013-03-19-20-36-50.jpg?w=520&#038;h=390\" width=\"520\" height=\"390\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">We made three big plates of it.

So it wasn&#8217;t exactly the healthiest of dinner parties.</p></div>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">We had a lot of fun making mandu with our friends. In fact, the next week we went to the store and bought more ingredients to make some, and we made a massive batch. So massive that we couldn&#8217;t even fry them all, but put them in bags and into the freezer for later cooking (which was the plan anyway).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Everyone in town must have decided to make mandu that weekend, because when we went to the store to get some \ub9cc\ub450\ud53c (mandu skins), there were only five packages left. We only used three or four, but we thought we would make more and bought all five. The next day I told my students that I made mandu and one of them said, &#8220;Teacher, did you buy at \ub18d\ud611 mart?&#8221; I said that I did. Had she seen me there and I didn&#8217;t say hello? My student sighed and said that she and her friend went to the store to find mandu skins, but there were none, and they went to another store, and another store, and another store, and they were all gone. And apparently at the store we went to, the clerk told her that some foreigners took the rest of the mandu skins. Uh-oh, did she think we cleared the whole town of \ub9cc\ub450\ud53c? I said that there were only a handful of packages left when we got to the store, and that seemed to make her feel a bit better. I asked her the next day if she could find \ub9cc\ub450\ud53c yet and she said that Harmony Mart had some (which I thought it would, because Harmony Mart is one of the biggest supermarkets in town and she hadn&#8217;t mentioned it in her list of \ub9cc\ub450\ud53c-less stores).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>\uc880\ube44</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Ashley was teaching a class about the word &#8220;please.&#8221; The students had to make posters with &#8220;Please&#8221; or &#8220;Please don&#8217;t.&#8221; Of course they made things like, &#8220;Please don&#8217;t shout&#8221; and &#8220;Please don&#8217;t jump.&#8221; But here&#8217;s my favorite:</p>\n<div style=\"width: 530px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/2013-03-19-16-45-001.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image \" id=\"i-2768\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/2013-03-19-16-45-001.jpg?w=520&#038;h=694\" width=\"520\" height=\"694\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Seriously, knock it off.</p></div>\n<p>_________________</p>\n<p>*When we were considering different textbooks for a few of the classes this year, those of us who teach &#8220;social studies&#8221; (I don&#8217;t) lamented that the books were language arts books and that we couldn&#8217;t find any good social studies books. After we cemented all of the decisions and had made the orders, we discovered an actual social studies book, a sample copy, in one of the Korean teacher&#8217;s classrooms. It must have been sent to the wrong room and the teacher didn&#8217;t know what to do with it. Teacher Heather was quite sad when she saw that book. We looked through it and it looks awesome. And I think it&#8217;s part of a series, so there are books for each grade level.

And I&#8217;ll tell you about the show later, but first I have to tell you what happened before the show.</p>\n<p>We got lost.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a good thing that we took an early train to Seoul to get the most out of our weekend, because if we had only arrived in time to see Cirque du Soleil, we wouldn&#8217;t have. We left Busan at 10 am on Saturday and arrived in Seoul around 12:30. Two and a half hours to <a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_IlYwIGvT4wM/TTkmS6PexkI/AAAAAAAAAbc/Yu4GTYOTaYE/s1600/busan1.jpg\">cross the entire country</a>. The KTX, I must say, is awesome. What happened after we got off, however, was not.</p>\n<p>Ashley and Kristina had found a hotel somewhat close to the show. Before we left Busan, I used Google Maps to tell me how to get to it from the train station. This was our plan: Get off the train, get to the hotel to check in, then explore the surrounding area until Kristina arrived. We had to check in before the show because the check-in time ended an hour after the start of the show. So on a piece of paper I wrote down what subway stations we had to stop at to get to the hotel.</p>\n<p>But apparently I wrote them down wrong. We had to take two lines to get to the area near the hotel (and then, after that, the map looked simple enough). We got on the first line and then I got a bit confused. I wrote down that we needed to go four stops, to \ub2f9\uace0\uac1c (Danggogae). But Danggogae was at the very end of the line, about 16 stops away. At the fifth stop, I realized that we should have gotten off one stop before, so we got off and got on the opposite direction subway train. The name of the fourth stop was the name I had written down as &#8220;Walk to [this place].&#8221; So instead of getting off at Danggogae and walking to another stop to transfer, I was simply supposed to transfer by getting off at the actual stop. Okay, sounds about right.</p>\n<p>So we got on the second line. And I only had one more name written down: \ub9c8\ucc9c (Macheon). And it was, you guessed it, at the end of the line. But I did <em>not</em>, unfortunately, realize what that meant. With the case of Danggogae, I had written down the other station&#8217;s name. With Macheon, however, I was aware of no other station. So we went a few stops beyond our actual stop and <em>then we left the metro entirely</em>. It was a dumb mistake, and now I definitely know to check whether the directions say, &#8220;Take line X <em>to</em> Y,&#8221; or, &#8220;Take line X <em>toward</em> Y.&#8221; We got out in what looked like the poor residential area of Chicago. I was expecting Seoul to be massive, with high rises everywhere. This place must have been on the very edge of the city. I couldn&#8217;t imagine the hotel being nearby, but we took a walk anyhow. It was supposedly 15 minutes by foot, so we headed in the direction we thought we were supposed to go.</p>\n<p>Nope. Nothing. &#8220;Well,&#8221; we said, &#8220;at least we&#8217;re getting in some exercise today.&#8221;</p>\n<p>And we got a lot of exercise that day. We walked for quite some time before deciding to go to a PC \ubc29 (PC bang, or room) to recheck our facts. And Ashley had been right. We saw a stop called Olympic Park, and she thought that was near the show and wanted to get off there. It wasn&#8217;t near the show, but it was near our hotel, and it was our actual stop.</p>\n<p>So we went back to the subway station and went to Olympic Park. And it&#8217;s a nice park, but we wanted to get to our hotel so we could stop searching, feel relaxed, and get something to eat. According to Google Maps, the hotel was actually in the park.</p>\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t. But some nice information desk woman pointed us in the right direction and said that we weren&#8217;t far. As it turns out, though, there are numerous hotels and motels in the direction she pointed us in. We couldn&#8217;t find it. We called Kristina to find out how close she was because, well, by now, it was almost time for her to arrive. We had been lost for hours. Kristina was almost at her last train stop, which was one stop over from another stop we were now near (but not the one Google told us to end at).</p>\n<p>So we just went to that stop so we could all find the hotel together. She knew how to get to it from that stop, so that&#8217;s what we did. And finally we all got to the hotel and checked in and got something to eat. And the hotel was quite nice, actually. Korea has things called &#8220;love motels,&#8221; which, from what I hear, are considerably luxurious for the price. They also have a reputation, which I am sure you can guess by the name. The placed we stayed at, The Hotel Cello, was apparently a former love motel that tried to reinvent itself. I&#8217;m not sure if it did or not, and to be honest, I don&#8217;t care. Because this is where we got to stay for the night:</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_286\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/img_2012.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-286\" title=\"IMG_2012\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/img_2012.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">I have never been in a hotel that provided a big screen TV plus a computer with Internet service.</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_285\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/img_2011.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-285\" title=\"IMG_2011\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/img_2011.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">I just like where the sink is, for some reason.

It isn\u0003t! - Actually, yes it is. A two-person whirlpool tub next to the very comfy bed. I think a room this nice could easily cost, in America, two or three times what we paid.</p></div>\n<p>And now, finally, the show. We saw Cirque du Soleil&#8217;s Varekai show. I honestly was not expecting much. Ashley and Kristina were the more excited of us three, and I simply hoped that the show would be decent. I hoped that it would live up to the hype that Cirque du Soleil has in general, but I feared that Cirque du Soleil might have been so popular just because it seemed like something that should have been popular. I was afraid that people walked away from shows saying, &#8220;It was fantastic!&#8221; only because dissing Cirque du Soleil would be akin to blasphemy. Or to convince themselves that the show was worth the time and money.</p>\n<p>And while my two favorite stage shows remain The Blue Man Group and JUMP, I did absolutely and enthusiastically enjoy Cirque du Soleil. We were not allowed, of course, to take pictures, but let me tell you about it. Just a bit.</p>\n<p>When the show was starting to start (it was hard to tell when it actually did), I thought, Oh no. It was just a bunch of people in strange costumes crawling around on stage or doing &#8220;interpetive dance.&#8221; This is going to get acclaimed simply for looking strange and maybe for having a shallow thematic blanket, I thought. But then the show was definitely in motion, and it was funny. There were all kinds of acts. Sometimes comedy or (obviously fake) magic acts, sometimes unbelievable acrobatics, sometimes even something with a &#8220;volunteer&#8221; pulled from the audience. Quite fun.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_287\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/img_2016.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-287\" title=\"IMG_2016\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/img_2016.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kristina took this picture of us before the show outside the circus tent.</p></div>\n<p>What I enjoyed most about the show was the timing of the music that fit nearly every move perfectly. I did not realize that the music was live, so I thought that every move was timed perfectly to match the music. But the music was indeed live, meaning the music was timed perfectly to match the moves. It was very intense.</p>\n<p>And then it was over, and then we went for drinks at a coffee shop. (Sound familiar to our last visit with Kristina?) I got a mint hot chocolate that was mighty tasty. And we talked about all kinds of things, from Korea to God to food to the show we just saw and more. And finally, we went to our hotel rooms, deciding on the way what time to meet each other again in the morning.</p>\n<p>On Sunday morning, we got up and met for breakfast at a local gimbap restaurant. We thought the menu was a bit expensive compared to gimbap places we were used to, but we quickly found out the answer: larger portions. We got stuffed. It&#8217;s something that doesn&#8217;t often happen to me in Korea unless I eat Western food. Korean food is so reliant on vegetables that, while I often eat <em>enough</em>, I rarely eat to the point of feeling overwhelmingly full.</p>\n<p>Then we took a walk over to Olympic Park. It was very nice, but Ashley and I could not enjoy it when we passed through the day before because we wanted to find our hotel. One nice thing about the park was seeing the cherry blossoms. They bloomed in Busan a few weeks ago and have started to fade away. Seoul&#8217;s spring started a bit later, so the blossoms were still fresh while we were there.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_293\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/img_2062.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-293\" title=\"IMG_2062\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/img_2062.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">I think these and pink magnolias are my favorite flowered trees.</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_303\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/img_2044.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-303\" title=\"IMG_2044\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/img_2044.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">More cherry blossoms.

(Ashley and I had our train tickets already, but even if we missed the train, we could get new tickets for free because we bought the foreigner-friendly Happy Rail Pass, which gave us a certain length of time to ride the trains rather than a certain number of rides.) And you can probably guess what we did next. We went to a coffee/bread shop in the bus terminal. It was nice to chat, although eventually we all realized that we should get something to eat. Breakfast a few hours previous and the bread treats at Paris Baguette made us feel relatively full, but we all decided that we should eat something just before leaving so that we wouldn&#8217;t be hungry on the train.</p>\n<p>So we ate some kimchi mandu (Korean dumplings). They were good. Then we went our separate ways.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_294\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/img_2075.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-294\" title=\"IMG_2075\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/img_2075.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">This dragon was waiting for us outside Busan Station when we got home.</p></div>\n<p>Note: After I talked to some co-workers about my trip to Seoul and about how massive the subway system is in that city, at least three of them, in separate conversations, mentioned that even they have difficulty navigating around Seoul and get easily confused by the massiveness of the subway system.

But there&#8217;s one new friend I would especially like to introduce you to: the vending machine.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I met the vending machine very soon after my arrival at Pukyong National University. I already mentioned one drink in <a href=\"http://129degreeseast.wordpress.com/2011/02/17/two-years/\">my first post</a> of this blog. Now I&#8217;ll tell you a bit more about them, and you can learn what kinds of fun and exciting culture shock I&#8217;ve run into already.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/img_1573.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-31\" title=\"IMG_1573\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/img_1573.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The three cans above are the Korean drinks I&#8217;ve consumed since my arrival. In fact, I consumed them in order, from left to right, starting with&#8230;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>Janchijip Sikhye</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/img_1574.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-23 alignleft\" style=\"margin:5px;\" title=\"IMG_1574\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/img_1574.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">This is the rice drink I mentioned above. It&#8217;s made by \ub86f\ub300 (Lotte), a name that I expect to see attached to products, signs, and places <a href=\"http://www.lotte.co.kr/english/s2_business/businessarea.html\">all across Korea</a>. In fact, all three beverages in this post are made by Lotte.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">It tasted quite like I expected it would based on the can&#8217;s design, a sweet rice drink flavor. What I didn&#8217;t expect was the level of sincerity the can&#8217;s design conveyed. There really is rice floating around in the drink. Once in a while I would get a grain, which would be all chewy from sitting in liquid. At the end of the can, there was a lot more rice. I should have shaken up the can to more evenly distribute the rice.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">The rice drink was good (I did mention before that it was yesterday&#8217;s breakfast), but not as good as&#8230;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right;\"><strong>Milkis</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/img_1575.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-24 alignright\" style=\"margin:5px;\" title=\"IMG_1575\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/img_1575.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">\ubc00\ud0a4\uc2a4 (milkiseu, but known in English as Milkis) is my favorite of the three drinks featured in this post. I was confused at first because it was called Milkis but the can says &#8220;New feeling of soda beverage.&#8221; I thought for a second that the line was just a mistranslation that occurs with lots of foreign products.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">No. The can is not misleading at all. With a name like Milkis, you&#8217;d expect it to have milk. And you&#8217;d be correct. And with a slogan like &#8220;New feeling of soda beverage,&#8221; you&#8217;d expect it to have\u00a0 corn syrup and carbonation. And, again, you&#8217;d be correct. Milkis, my friends, is a dairy soda.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">And do you know what my assessment of dairy sodas is after trying this drink? I&#8217;ll tell you: it&#8217;s positive. I said to Ashley after my first sip that it &#8220;tastes like a rice drink but also a lot like an Orange Dreamsicle!&#8221; (Apparently, they&#8217;re actually called Orange Creamsicles and I keep thinking it&#8217;s Dreamsicle.) She took a sip and told me to take it away before she drank all of my soda.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">So Milkis was good, and because of our medical exam today, we were told to fast starting at 9 PM last night. So to make sure my fast was as short as possible, I visited my mechanical beverage-dispensing friend for a third time yesterday around 8:45, and I tried&#8230;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>Koko Podo</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/img_1576.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-25\" style=\"margin:5px;\" title=\"IMG_1576\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/img_1576.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>\ucf54\ucf54\ud3ec\ub3c4(Koko Podo) is translated pretty clearly on the can as &#8220;Coco Grape.&#8221; And that&#8217;s pretty much what it tasted like: a cross between coconut and grape juice. Maybe more grape, which is to be expected.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">What wasn&#8217;t expected was the manifestation one of the ingredients I was able to read on the can. In the picture to the left, on the top right of the visible portion of the can there are some red letters. The top line reads ,&#8221;\ubc31\ud3ec\ub3c4\uacfc\uc999 10%,&#8221; (baegpodoguajeup) meaning &#8220;White grape juice 10%.&#8221; I had to use Google Translate to figure that out. I did not, however, have to use it to figure out the bottom line, which reads, &#8220;\ucf54\ucf54\ub11b\uc824\ub9ac 8%.&#8221; The transliteration of that is &#8220;kokoneotjelli,&#8221; which sounds pretty much like &#8220;coconut jelly.&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">After I drank a few ounces of this stuff, something semi-solid touched my lips for just a split second before descending back into the can. Now imagine it yourself. You&#8217;re drinking something that has the constant consistency of juice. Then something touches your lips and <em>retreats</em>. Wouldn&#8217;t you suspect some bug might have moved away from being eaten by a human?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">No? Oh. Well, I did. So I poured the can into a cup and, well, it was just a chunk of coconut jelly. There were several of them in the can, now in my cup, and they were pretty good.</p>\n", "post_id": 28, "location": false, "date": "02-18-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>Praise the LORD, because we&#8217;re still living well in Korea. We have our days, but who doesn&#8217;t?</p>\n<p>In high school, one of my friends remarked, upon seeing me with yet another novel supplementing my official school materials, that I read books &#8220;like normal people read newspapers.&#8221; Actually, I was never much into newspapers. Is that a normal-people thing? But if a month ago you had asked me about what good books I&#8217;d read lately, I would have cast my eyes down in shame.*1 A book every four or five months, give or take? I know that my priorities in life have changed in the years and that I won&#8217;t even think of putting READ EVERYTHING on my bucket list, but I have to make at least some time for a good book.</p>\n<p>And it&#8217;s looking up. I read two books this week. And I read another a few weeks ago. That one,\u00a0<em>Cloud Atlas</em>,*2 was for the book club I recently joined (oh, update: I joined a book club last month, the same book club Ashley joined last year), but the two this week were for my own pleasure. Just typical-length, page-turner science fiction novels that I bought at the used section of What The Book?, but I have plans to get around to that patient copy of Dostoevsky&#8217;s <em>Demons</em> that has been waiting on our B&amp;N nook.</p>\n<p>So what&#8217;s with all this balderdash about books? I recognized one of the reasons that I haven&#8217;t been reading much lately. Or writing. So I dealt with it and managed to, I think, decrease a major part of that obstacle. So maybe, just maybe, a month won&#8217;t pass without an update on this blog, as April did. And January. And last August. LORD willing, of course (<a title=\"James 4:13-15\" href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%204:13-15&amp;version=KJV\" target=\"_blank\">James 4:13-15</a>).</p>\n<p>This week was rather strange. Because of scheduling and field trip reservation issues, we only had one normal day of work this week. That day was Monday. On Tuesday, the third and fourth graders went on a three-day-two-night field trip. So they came to school today. On Wednesday, the fifth and sixth graders went for the same duration. They weren&#8217;t in school today. The first and second graders, all who remained in school on Wednesday and Thursday, went on a day trip yesterday (Thursday). So we teachers went with them. We went to Pinnacle Land, a lovely garden about an hour away from Gwangcheon. It really is a beautiful place.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/468522_589269123647_1722841608_o.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image\" id=\"i-2927\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/468522_589269123647_1722841608_o.jpg?w=600&#038;h=453\" width=\"600\" height=\"453\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/981041_589269168557_282624248_o.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image\" id=\"i-2929\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/981041_589269168557_282624248_o.jpg?w=600&#038;h=795\" width=\"600\" height=\"795\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/468768_589269253387_1734468393_o.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image\" id=\"i-2930\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/468768_589269253387_1734468393_o.jpg?w=600&#038;h=453\" width=\"600\" height=\"453\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/964918_589269228437_1114568772_o.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image\" id=\"i-2932\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/964918_589269228437_1114568772_o.jpg?w=600&#038;h=453\" width=\"600\" height=\"453\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/461094_589269108677_1711208422_o.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image\" id=\"i-2934\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/461094_589269108677_1711208422_o.jpg?w=600&#038;h=796\" width=\"600\" height=\"796\" /></a></p>\n<p>Last weekend was a three-day weekend. Friday was Buddha&#8217;s Birthday. Our upcoming anniversary is on a workday, so we went to Seoul for the weekend as an early celebration. We met and went to church with Sister Maxine from Ashley&#8217;s church back home. She came to Korea to work for Sahmyook University as a professor of public health (if memory serves me correctly). As it turns out, Sahmyook University is not on the same campus as the Sahmyook Language Institute. And I&#8217;m sorry to say it if you&#8217;re reading this from Our Dear AU, but \uc0bc\uc721\ub300\ud559\uad50 is the most beautiful Adventist campus I&#8217;ve set foot on (a grand total of three). I won&#8217;t diminish the elegance of the campus with amateur cell phone photos, which is a synonymic phrase for &#8220;Sorry, I was too lazy to take pictures.&#8221; Some of the people there said we just visited at a lucky time of the year, though.</p>\n<p>We also ate some delicious food. Two standouts among our dining experiences that weekend were On the Border, the best Mexican food we&#8217;ve had yet in Korea, and \uc11c\ub798\ubd88\uace0\uae30-\ud55c\uc0c1\ucc28\ub9bc (Seorae Bulgogi &#8211; Hansang Charim), a place where you can eat high quality Korean beef cooked over charcoal right at your table.</p>\n<p>Finally, we saw <em>Umoja</em><em></em>, a South African production that consisted of various South African dances and music, traditional and modern, structured around a loose narrative. I enjoyed most of it.</p>\n<p>Then we ate dinner and came back to Gwangcheon to go back to work on Monday. That reminds me that I was wrong earlier. Monday was not the only normal work day this week. There was no normal work day. The first three periods of Monday were canceled for the annual English competition semi-finals. Each English teacher was assigned to judge a different classroom, where students had gathered according to what activities they had chosen to do for the competition. Singing, storytelling, giving a speech, writing a letter, writing a book report, writing an essay, and translating a small document. Students had to pick two categories (one spoken/sung and one written). Teachers had to give scores and choose the top six students in each age bracket, who will perform in the final competition this coming Wednesday, where all the teachers will judge every category. Should be fun.</p>\n<p>__________________</p>\n<p>*1-The exception would have been the Bible, which, by God&#8217;s grace, I&#8217;ve read from daily for, well, I don&#8217;t know how long.

We&#8217;ve been there a few times (Kristina lives somewhat near Suwon), but we&#8217;d never been to the old city wall. Now we&#8217;ve visited it. I had a blast. Suwon is the only walled city I remember visiting. Most of the wall is still there, although portions were reconstructed and one small portion is missing. The city has developed around that spot, so it couldn&#8217;t be reconstructed after war damaged it. Or some other reason. It was pretty cool to walk along the wall (we went around the entire perimeter, which is no longer enough to cover the entire city, but still a lengthy walk). We considered taking a trolley around part of the wall, but, because of the holiday, the next available time was four hours later. So we walked and had a great hike.</p>\n<p>We met an old man who was a tour guide for a large group of Koreans. They were taking a break on a raised platform (awesome breeze that thing had for such a hot day), so he asked us where we were from and said he really enjoyed his time visiting Texas when he was in the military. We ate ice cream near the highest elevation of the wall (as a reward for the climb we had just completed). We considered the society of the time period. I did, at least, as I enjoyed studying the guard posts and archers&#8217; posts, wondering what it must have been like to live as one of those soldiers. Maybe &#8220;studying&#8221; isn&#8217;t such an accurate word as &#8220;imagining&#8221; and &#8220;playing make-believe&#8221; are.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a style=\"font-style:normal;line-height:23px;text-decoration:underline;\" href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/goingup.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image aligncenter\" id=\"i-3063\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/theapproach.jpg?w=520&#038;h=390\" width=\"520\" height=\"390\" /></a><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/eba8b8eba6aceca1b0ec8bac.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image aligncenter\" id=\"i-3060\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/eba8b8eba6aceca1b0ec8bac.jpg?w=520&#038;h=390\" width=\"520\" height=\"390\" /><a style=\"font-style:normal;line-height:23px;\" href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/goingup.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image aligncenter\" id=\"i-3062\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/goingup.jpg?w=520&#038;h=694\" width=\"520\" height=\"694\" /></a><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/ashleytop.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image aligncenter\" id=\"i-3061\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/ashleytop.jpg?w=520&#038;h=390\" width=\"520\" height=\"390\" /></a><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/throughtheeyesofanarcher.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image aligncenter\" id=\"i-3064\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/throughtheeyesofanarcher.jpg?w=520&#038;h=694\" width=\"520\" height=\"694\" /></a><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/wallashleysmile.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image aligncenter\" id=\"i-3065\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/wallashleysmile.jpg?w=520&#038;h=694\" width=\"520\" height=\"694\" /></a></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I had written something about this trip a few days after it happened. However, I was in a particular mood at that time, causing me to completely\u2014and obviously\u2014fabricate some events. Involving time travel. It wasn&#8217;t any good. I trashed it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>\ubc14\ubca0\ud050 [Barbecue]</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">About a week before the Fourth of July, one of our friends invited a small group of people to the roof of her apartment for a cookout. We feel bad for this friend. She lives out of town. It takes us thirty minutes to walk go her apartment. That&#8217;s about how much time it takes her to walk to one of the two (I think) schools she works at (and it&#8217;s the closer one). We live rather close to our school, convenience stores, grocery stores, and a few small restaurants. Her area is just apartments and fields. And her apartment is even smaller than ours.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">But she invited us over and her roof is awesome. We can go on our roof, but it&#8217;s small and there&#8217;s not much to it. Her apartment&#8217;s larger roof has a little gazebo, a table, and a barbecue grill. It was great. Ripul, our friend from India, made some awesome food, including some of the best spinach I&#8217;ve ever had (the simple secret is fresh-squeezed lemon juice and garlic). Phoebe, our friend from China, brought some Chinese steamed beef that is similar to corned beef. We also had chicken, salad, mashed potatoes, Chinese naan-like bread, and one of the staples of a good cookout: hamburgers. Ashley and I decided to indulge a bit with our contribution to the barbecue by buying a few packs of ground beef to make hamburgers. And here I thought I was going to wait until going to America to have a good burger (they exist in Korea, but not as much, and generally not as good).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">It was great to have that time on the roof. We ate and talked and relaxed from a stressful week at work. We even lit some fireworks.</p>\n<p><img class=\" wp-image aligncenter\" id=\"i-3107\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/grillface.jpg?w=520&#038;h=694\" width=\"520\" height=\"694\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/hamburgersmile.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image aligncenter\" id=\"i-3106\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/hamburgersmile.jpg?w=520&#038;h=390\" width=\"520\" height=\"390\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>\ud325\ube59\uc218 [Patbingsu]</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><b>It&#8217;s summer, so it&#8217;s \ud325\ube59\uc218 (patbingu) season. Patbingsu is a Korean treat made of shaved ice, milk, and \ud325 beans (azuki beans, which are sweet, red beans). Usually, however, patbingsu includes more ingredients. Fruit, cornflakes, ice cream, ddeok (chewy rice cakes), chewy jelly pieces, nuts, and so on. It&#8217;s kind of like a snow cone and a sundae combined (or it can be). Anyway, here are a couple of pictures of Ashley with a delicious bingsu we recently had that was made with coffee grounds:</b></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/patbingsu.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image aligncenter\" id=\"i-3115\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/patbingsu.jpg?w=520&#038;h=694\" width=\"520\" height=\"694\" /><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/ashleypatbingsu.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image aligncenter\" id=\"i-3117\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/ashleypatbingsu.jpg?w=520&#038;h=694\" width=\"520\" height=\"694\" /></a></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><b><br /></b><strong>\ud551\ud06c \uc5ec\uc790 [The Pink Woman]</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Actually, she hasn&#8217;t worn her pink vest in a while, so I should probably find another nickname for her. She&#8217;s the old \ud560\uba38\ub2c8 (grandmother) who lives near our apartment and who is always excited to see us foreigners. She always makes some strange hooting sound, like she&#8217;s both pleasantly surprised to see us and wants to get our attention, and I think she claps, too. She comes up to us and tells us \uc774\ubed0! \uc774\ubed0! (Pretty! Pretty!) And lots of other things. Sometimes &#8220;\uc65c \uc774\ubed0?&#8221; (Why are you pretty?) or &#8220;\uc65c \uc6c3\uc5b4?&#8221; (Why are you laughing?) or &#8220;\uc5b4\ub514 \uac00?&#8221; (Where are you going?). Plus stuff I don&#8217;t even understand.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Things started out quite nice. She asked us those questions, or made some comment about the weather or something. I don&#8217;t know, really, since I can&#8217;t understand much spoken Korean, especially if it&#8217;s spoken excitedly by an old woman. One time, apparently, she took Linda to her house and gave her a \ucc38\uc678 (Korean melon). The consistent thing is that she calls us \uc774\ubed0. I seem to be particularly \uc774\ubed0 for her. Is it the beard? I can&#8217;t imagine a beard being &#8220;pretty.&#8221; Lately, she&#8217;s becoming scary. And violent.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Over the past few weeks, she has taken to slapping me on a face with both hands. It&#8217;s an affectionate kind of slapping to emphasize how \uc774\ubed0 I am. The slaps have grown in intensity, though. One day I remarked to Ashley that one time it actually kind of hurt. As we turned to walk to our apartment, she said, &#8220;\uc544\ud30c?&#8221; (Are you hurt?) I said no, so she made like she was going to try again, to make sure it hurt this time. It was a joke, of course, and she waved me away. But my most recent encounter, the other day, was too much. Not only did she slap me, but she grabbed my chest. Yeah, I&#8217;m a man, but I&#8217;m also 100 kilograms. I have somewhat to grab. Regardless, it&#8217;s not a fun experience. Shocked, I couldn&#8217;t think of a response other than &#8220;\uc65c\uc694?&#8221; (Why?) So now, it&#8217;s not so fun to see her these days. We&#8217;re going to avoid her for a time by taking a slight detour to get home. Later, I&#8217;ll be prepared with &#8220;\ud558\uc9c0 \ub9c8\uc138\uc694&#8221; and &#8220;\ub9cc\uc9c0\uc9c0 \ub9c8\uc138\uc694&#8221; (&#8220;Don&#8217;t do that&#8221; and &#8220;Don&#8217;t touch&#8221;). Ashley said she also tried to bite her arm. That completely baffles me.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>\ud559\uae30\ub97c \ub05d\ub0b4\uae30 [Finishing the Semester]</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong></strong>We had a rather intense semester. A few weeks ago, we made final exams for the students. Two weeks ago, our students took those exams. Last week, we gave students their fourth and final quiz (if we hadn&#8217;t gotten to that before the final exam because of the number of canceled classes or special events this semester). We also wrote their report cards, which is a rather tedious process, including entering their quiz average and exam grades, grades for their performance in class (based on a list of 10 learning objectives), and three comments. Per student per class (so one student, with three classes, will have 6 quiz and exam grades, 30 learning objective grades, and nine comments). I have about 79 students, nine of them in two classes, so I wrote 88 sets. So 264 comments, 880 objective scores, and the quiz and exam scores for them all.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">And this week, we have pretty much nothing. The fifth and sixth graders are on a field trip Monday through Wednesday, so a couple of my classes have been canceled. This week we have the chance to relax and teach without all of the extra paperwork. Although now, with exams and quizzes out of the way, and summer break on the horizon, we have to motivate towards learning children who greet us with, &#8220;Good morning, teacher. Today party?&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">We have to motivate ourselves, too. :-p</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>\ub2ed\ubcf6\uc74c\ud0d5 [Dakbokkeumtang]</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Dakbokkeumtang is a delicious Korean stew made with chicken, potatoes, onions, and a spicy sauce made of garlic, soy sauce, pepper paste, and pepper powder.

I don&#8217;t know much about the broader issue, though. I&#8217;ve <em>heard</em> that there is quite a stigma against people with special needs and the disabled in Korea&#8211;Brian tells me that he was mortified earlier this week as one of his special needs students was yelled at by the bus driver for some reason he couldn&#8217;t understand (she had the money). And I have heard that in Korea they &#8220;hide&#8221; these students in regular classrooms and, generally, try to ignore the situation as much as possible. But it&#8217;s all hearsay. All I know for sure is that I have children with special needs in two of my fourth grade classes, a girl in one class and a boy in another. I will call them Peter and Polly.**</p>\n<p>It seems, for the most part, these students in my classroom are ignored by the Korean teachers unless they cause a fuss&#8211;One class was completely disrupted for over 10 minutes because, since we had rearranged the class that day, the boy didn&#8217;t know where his seat was, which threw all of the students off. Most activities that we do in the English classroom are just too complicated for these students, so they just sit in my class doing nothing a lot of the time. One of the students, Peter, seems non-verbal; he mostly just sits and stares. Polly, on the other hand, likes to run around and catch imaginary butterflies during the break between classes; I&#8217;m not sure if either child can read or write Korean (And I know they can&#8217;t read or write or understand <em>me</em>). So they sit in my classroom, with their books open and ignored, and from time to time I wonder: what in the world can they be getting out of this?</p>\n<p>Also I wonder what they are expected to take from my class. They can&#8217;t participate in most of the activities. How did they advance to the next grade with the rest of their class? How does all this work? I don&#8217;t have any answers or even any theories. \u00a0I \u00a0just know that they both do seem to \u00a0enjoy it when the lesson includes songs and chants. Even if they can&#8217;t really sing the words along with the other students, they smile, clap and bob their heads. And Polly was really happy when I played a short game of Simon Says with the class, since she could clap and jump and wiggle along with the other students. So I think maybe that&#8217;s something. Being around the other kids must be something as well.</p>\n<p>But something else I&#8217;ve noticed that&#8217;s <em>really</em> something is the way the other students treat Polly and Peter. When I was young, my mom worked at a school for special needs kids. \u00a0I was terrified of the children there and would run away from them. In fact, this fear persisted for several years; I avoided such students until my senior year of high school, when I would sometimes hang out in their classroom with some friends who helped out there. After graduating from high school and starting university, I needed a summer job.</p>\n<p>So, during the summers, I worked in several special needs classrooms across the High Desert as a substitute educational assistant&#8211;which meant that I changed diapers, played with and fed the kids, and made sure they didn&#8217;t steal each other&#8217;s lunches, get naked, or escape from the campus grounds. I listened to them try to converse with me in their own personal languages. Sometimes, depending on the students&#8217; levels, I helped with puzzles or homework assignments. It was a good job. And even though I have always had a soft spot for children in general (because they are so cute and naive), I discovered that I had even <em>larger </em>supply of\u00a0patience and compassion for special needs children.</p>\n<p>So, over the course of my life, fear turned to love. For me, this was a long process. What I am struck by in my classes, however, is the compassion and care that the other 4th grade students display. When entering class, a little boy will gently guide Peter to his seat. If Polly gets confused or starts crying or if she stays in her seat after class is over, which happens, \u00a0a little girl will speak in soft tones to comfort her, or remind her that class is over now and it&#8217;s time to leave. I don&#8217;t know how big a role the teachers may have played in cultivating this kind of behavior, but it just amazes me.</p>\n<p>** Please forgive me, I don&#8217;t know their names. I have over five hundred students. I know maybe five of their names so far.</p>\n", "post_id": 312, "location": false, "date": "04-22-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>Chuseok, one of the most important Korean holidays, is over. The three-day holiday started Wednesday (the 18th), giving us a five-day weekend. Our school decided to throw in Tuesday as well, so we had a six-day weekend. For our time off, Ashley and I visited Suwon. Our friend Kristina lives near Suwon, so on Wednesday she came to Suwon and we had a great time hanging out with her. We ate at VIPS, a nice buffet, and got rather full so that, aside from some drinks at a coffee-tea shop, we didn&#8217;t eat again for about eight hours. We had decided also to watch a new release, so we chilled and talked at a coffee shop until it was time to see the movie.</p>\n<p>This was the first time we had purchased movie tickets on the internet, and actually, it was really nice. When we got to the theater, we didn&#8217;t get a number and wait in line. I went to the machine, punched in my reservation number, and the ticket came out. (It&#8217;s only one ticket that indicates the number of seats. In fact, in Korea, your ticket has not only the number of seats, but also the seat numbers, which you usually get to choose when purchasing. And the ticket is printed on your receipt. Just a bit of Korean movie ticket trivia for ya.)</p>\n<p>Now, about the movie. We saw <em>The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones</em>, and I didn&#8217;t care for it. Maybe it&#8217;s alright for a movie to feature demons if the protagonists are fighting against the demons (which is what this movie was about), but some of the other things about the movie made me feel uncomfortable. I wouldn&#8217;t recommend this movie for that reason and others.</p>\n<p>After the movie, we took a walk to find the wall that surrounds the old borders of Suwon. I mentioned Hwaseong Fortress in a <a title=\"Potpourri for 700\" href=\"http://129degreeseast.wordpress.com/2013/07/16/potpourri-for-700/\" target=\"_blank\">previous post</a>, but we wanted to see it this time at night, with all the lights. It took us a while to get there because I made a mistake. We got to the bus stop we had gone to before. I was scanning all the bus numbers and their routes to find which buses we could board. I had determined a few numbers. I decided at one point to double-check and saw a bus coming, so I looked at that bus number&#8217;s route and thought I saw our intended destination on it. &#8220;We can get this one,&#8221; I said, so we hurriedly boarded the bus.</p>\n<p>You can probably guess that, in my haste, I misread the route. Inside the bus, the route map had no such place that we knew of. We got off after a few stops and then decided to simply walk to the wall. After walking a few blocks, we could see some of the towers in the distance, so we figured out a way. We didn&#8217;t go around the whole wall this time, but we walked a portion of it until we got to the place near a bus stop Kristina could take to get back home. There&#8217;s also a little park there, with trees and benches, and we wanted to go to a \uae40\ubc25\ucc9c\uad6d (Kimbap Cheonguk, or Kimbap Heaven) to get some <a title=\"A picture of \uae40\ubc25.\" href=\"http://postfiles14.naver.net/20130812_125/endsky_1376295037311ekg7D_JPEG/CAM00610.jpg?type=w2\" target=\"_blank\">\uae40\ubc25</a> to eat at the park. Unfortunately, when I was trying to ask if we could get some kimbap to go, the woman there told me there was no kimbap. There was a man right next to her making several rolls, but maybe that was the last of the rice, or they didn&#8217;t have foil for take-out kimbap? I don&#8217;t know. So we just went to the convenience store and got some drinks. Kristina and I both tried a new juice we&#8217;d never seen before, called \uccad\ubaa9, but it tasted a bit weird.</p>\n<p>Anyway, we talked and drank our juice at the park until it was time for Kristina to go home. It was a really great time, relaxing and talking to an old friend and being outside Hwaseong Fortress at night.</p>\n<p>The next day, yesterday, Ashley and I went to Everland, which is an amusement park. I had been there once for a field trip, but Ashley wasn&#8217;t feeling well that day, so she missed out. Actually, that day was extremely busy, with a three-hour wait for one of the park&#8217;s most popular rides! We saw so many people wearing school uniforms that said every school in Korea must have had an amusement park field trip that day. This time, we counted on it being Chuseok for the park to be less crowded. And even though Everland gave a huge discount for foreigners to attract customers for the holidays, and there were indeed a lot of non-Koreans there, it wasn&#8217;t too crowded.</p>\n<p>The most crowded parts were the lines to get in the park itself and the line for Lost Valley, something we didn&#8217;t go on because the line was an estimated 100 minutes. We arrived just more than an hour before the park opened and waited in line to get tickets, although we found out that to purchase the foreigners&#8217; discount tickets, we&#8217;d have to go to the information booth. The lines were much shorter there. One Korean woman tried to go in the line, only to find out (rather quickly due to the line&#8217;s brevity) that she&#8217;d have to go to another line. <em>Which one? That one (pointing to a line more than 50 strong). Sigh.</em> We got our tickets and entered the park just minutes after it opened. As we made our way to a ride at the other side of the park, we passed Lost Valley. Everyone must have gone straight to it, because we heard employees telling people there would be a two-hour wait. It must have calmed down later in the day, because of the 100-minute signs, but just a bit.</p>\n<p>Ashley and I got Q-Passes for a few of the attractions, so when we returned at our designated times, we didn&#8217;t have to wait in line. We got to ride the T-Express, something I and our co-workers had missed out on last time, and it was a great roller coaster ride. It&#8217;s the world&#8217;s second steepest wooden roller coaster (the most frightening part of the ride is that, when you&#8217;re going up the first incline to prepare for the big drop, the track is in a perfect U-shape so that you are directly confronted with your impending fate, and you greatly anticipate that mind-boggling slope). And even though it was wooden, it wasn&#8217;t too shaky. We went on a wooden roller coaster at Michigan Adventure during our summer vacation, and that ride, while fun, beat the sense out of me.</p>\n<p>We also saw lots of animals in the zoo-like areas of the park (although the actual attractions had long lines that we didn&#8217;t bother to endure in the blazing sun, like the Lost Valley attraction I mentioned earlier), a &#8220;hologram concert&#8221; of PSY&#8217;s &#8220;Gangnam Style&#8221; and &#8220;Gentleman&#8221; (more like a projection on three walls), and a parade. We weren&#8217;t too excited about the parade, because we were trying to get to one last stop before leaving the park, and the procession kept us from moving forward.</p>\n<p>Among the other attractions and areas we visited were the rose gardens (which had dozens and dozens of cultivars of roses), Amazon Express and the Mystery House. The Amazon Express is like the circular raft water rides you see in American amusement parks, but one notable difference was that the rafts have tarp-like covers over the seats to prevent water from splashing you, although some water inevitably manages to hit its intended target.</p>\n<p>And the Mystery House was a strange ride. We couldn&#8217;t understand the Korean, of course, so the two gargoyle things that started talking to each other didn&#8217;t make sense to us, but Ashley imagined that they were controlled by two magicians who were trying to boast about who was stronger, which led to the ride passengers being victims of their feud. We were in seats in a room and the house started to turn around. I thought that our seats were only rocking to give an initial effect, while the room itself spun on an axis. However, Ashley thought that we actually went upside down. She says she rose from her seat, but I didn&#8217;t notice that. Maybe I was concentrating on telling myself that it was the room, separated axially from its passengers, that was moving, and not we the passengers ourselves. At the end of it, air blew on our feet, which was only slightly startling, but then our seats moved, as if mice were running under our cushions. Now <em>that</em> was uncomfortable. One kid near us started shouting something about \ub625\uce68 (ddong chim). Apparently, that part of the ride felt like, or made him as uncomfortable as, \ub625\uce68. Note: \ub625\uce68 means &#8220;poop needle,&#8221; and it&#8217;s kind of like a wedgie, only it&#8217;s worse. The underwear still gets moved inward, only not by pulling, but by pushing. Yeah, <a title=\"Beware the Dong Chim! (Coffee Helps)\" href=\"http://coffee-helps.com/2009/10/21/beware-the-dong-chim/\" target=\"_blank\">like that</a>.</p>\n<p>(Fortunately, I have experienced \ub625\uce68 enough times to count with only the number of fingers required to perform it. Although our students aren&#8217;t the most respectful group of students, they don&#8217;t really do much \ub625\uce68.)</p>\n<p>Anyway, what the kid said was really funny, so that we all left the ride with some good humor.</p>\n<p>One more thing happened to us at Everland that I must mention. While Ashley and I waited for our Q-Pass reservation time for the Amazon Express, and as we had grown tired from the sun and from so much walking, we sat down for the last ten or so minutes before our ride. At one point, a middle-aged man (perhaps a bit older) came up to us and said &#8220;\uc5ec\uae30 \uc549\uc744\uac8c.&#8221; Instinctively we got up from our seats and let the man, and whom we presumed was his son, sit in our places. I hadn&#8217;t even pieced together the words he had said or what they had meant until after the fact.</p>\n<p>This was very interesting to me because the man did not say something like, &#8220;May I sit here?&#8221; or &#8220;Care to lend an old man a seat?&#8221; or &#8220;I need to seat down.&#8221; What he said was, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to sit here.&#8221; I imagine that if we had been in America, that presumptuous old man might have been looked at funny. I think many people would have gotten up for him, but some would have remained sitting, and they might have felt justified in denying a seemingly rude old man his wishes.</p>\n<p>In Korea, older people feel entitled. They have served under their elders all their lives, so now it&#8217;s their turn. They are famous, especially the women, for cutting in line or pushing people out of their way or bossing people around. Again, this isn&#8217;t something that actually happens often to me (or I just don&#8217;t notice it or let it bother me). So I was kind of amazed when this old man told Ashley that her seat was now his.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not saying that I was necessarily offended by the old man or didn&#8217;t want to get out of my seat. He said it, and we got up. There was no thinking or even bitterness that he had taken our seats. We simply got up. After all, our ride time was in just two minutes.</p>\n<p>We left around 6 and made our way to where Kristina lives. Our route perhaps wasn&#8217;t the best, and we had some waiting and transfers to do, so that it was a couple of hours before we finally met up with her, but we made it. Kristina invited us to her apartment, where she served us awesome zucchini boats (zucchini baked with vegetables and other yummy things), and we had a good time there just talking and relaxing after a day of much walking and sun. We stayed too late to take a bus back to Suwon, although I wasn&#8217;t really planning on doing that. I had been awake since six in the morning and had taken several forms of public transportation already. I was saving our taxi trip for the end. Fortunately, Kristina&#8217;s place was closer to Suwon than we had thought. Our cab fare was only 20,000 won (about 18 dollars), including the 5,000 won the \uc544\uc800\uc528 tacked on because now he had to go back to his own city after midnight. Cab fares are also more expensive after midnight in general, so I think the price was quite reasonable.</p>\n<p>On Friday we got up and left our hotel with just a few minutes before check-out. We actually received a call to our room to remind us that the deadline was approaching. Our return train tickets weren&#8217;t until almost five, so we had a few hours to wander around. I thanked God that there were lockers available for us at Suwon Station so that we wouldn&#8217;t have to carry our backpacks around with us while we did some window-shopping, ate lunch, enjoyed some smoothies, and bought some groceries to take back home with us (that store had some items not easily found in our area).</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_3296\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/2013-09-19-11-14-12.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-3296\" alt=\"Beautiful Ashley models an interesting hat.\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/2013-09-19-11-14-12.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Beautiful Ashley models an interesting hat.</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_3300\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/2013-09-19-16-05-10.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-3300\" alt=\"I don't know if you can see it well, but there's a Photoshopped picture of me projected on the wall at the PSY &quot;hologram&quot; concert.\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/2013-09-19-16-05-10.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">I don&#8217;t know if you can see it well, but there&#8217;s a Photoshopped picture of me projected on the wall at the PSY &#8220;hologram&#8221; concert.</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_3299\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/2013-09-19-11-56-48.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-3299\" alt=\"Only the mean bird came for Ashley's food.

Our friend Linda goes, too. We call it EAC, which stands for &#8220;English Adventure Club.&#8221; I don&#8217;t know why, because half of the program is in Korean. The first half is in English. In this half, the English teachers sing a handful of English Bible songs, then tell a Bible story, then do a group activity that, as much as possible, ties in to the story. (Because we are limited to activities for a large group of children, the connection is sometimes tenuous.) Then the second half is some kind of activity led by the Korean teachers.</p>\n<p>Ever since our school got its own pastor, who changed EAC, things have been better for us. We used to have our three-part English half every week. When our pastor came, he wanted to give age-appropriate sermons to the children. So he made our duties every other week. On one Saturday, we do all of our parts. On the next Saturday, we only sing songs with the students to start the program. After that, the pastor takes over until the time for the Korean teachers&#8217; activity. We stay and listen to the sermons because they are bilingual. The pastor writes the sermon a week in advance, gives it to Teacher Heather to translate, and I edit it. So I know what the sermon is about, but Ashley and Linda don&#8217;t. I also don&#8217;t know how the visual aids will add to the sermon or bring out the message, so sometimes I hear or see something new during the actual delivery. When the pastor delivers the sermon, another student stands with him to read the English translations, with Korean and English being alternated line by line.</p>\n<p>After the Korean-led activity is finished, the students go home and the teachers stay to have lunch together. It&#8217;s usually very nice. The English teachers&#8217; office is on the other side of the school from the Korean teachers&#8217; classrooms. (In fact, it&#8217;s in another building, although the two buildings are connected by a second-floor walkway.) We don&#8217;t interact with the Korean teachers as much as we&#8217;d like, so it&#8217;s nice to have lunch with them once in a while.</p>\n<p>The activity led by the Korean teachers are often very cool. One time, the students went outside and had to find things in nature that matched descriptions on a piece of paper. Another time, they did a scavenger hunt inside the school. That made me glad and upset at the same time. Last semester, I wanted to do that for our English activity, but I wasn&#8217;t sure if it would be possible to let the students roam the school unsupervised. I was discouraged from trying it. But now that I know that they can do it, I plan to make an English scavenger hunt for them, probably for the end of the semester. The students have also made things, such as clay things, \uc0c8\ub07c (ropes made of rice straw), and food. One time, each group of students had a few boxes of Jenga blocks to build things. They had a few categories of competitions. One of the categories they had was to build a strong design, and then the pastor deemed me the Big Bad Wolf and declared that I would try to blow their structures down. All groups passed.</p>\n<p>A few weeks ago, the activity by the Korean teachers was writing the Book of Genesis (or, to be more precise, \ucc3d\uc138\uae30, which is the Korean name for it). Each student was given a piece of paper that had a chapter (or, if the chapter was long or the student was in a lower grade, a portion of a chapter) of Genesis and a piece of paper to write it on. The paper wasn&#8217;t the kind of paper that you would find in actual scrolls, but it was like grey colored paper, to at least be somewhat different from unnatural, pure white copy paper. The pastor asked us to do it, too. Ashley and Linda wrote their parts in English, but I decided to write the portion I was given as it was on the paper, in Korean.</p>\n<p>This weekend, the students took the papers they had written on and put them together into scrolls. I don&#8217;t think the whole Book of Genesis was featured, but each group of students had its own continuous section that they taped together and attached to the wooden rods at the ends of the scrolls. It was really neat.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_3304\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/2013-09-28-10-44-19.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-3304\" alt=\"Students roll up a finished scroll.\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/2013-09-28-10-44-19.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=768\"   /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Students roll up a finished scroll.</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_3305\" style=\"width: 779px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/2013-09-28-10-45-25.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-3305\" alt=\"Here's a section spread out on the floor before the wooden rods are fixed to the paper.

Last week, they updated the announcement to indicate that the field trip would take place on Monday because the tour bus rental companies were already booked for Tuesday. On Friday, at the end of the school day, our school told us that we would have the option of staying home. Normally, we go with the students on their field trips. If the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd graders go on a different field trip than the 4th, 5th, and 6th graders, we go according to which grade we&#8217;re assigned (I&#8217;m assigned to the 4th grade for events like this and for reading their English diaries). But for this field trip, we had the option of staying home.</p>\n<p>We were told about fifteen minutes before the end of the work day, so we had that much time to decide if we&#8217;d be going or staying. At first, I wanted to go on the field trip. It was to be a visit to a forest area. Nature-based outings are always enjoyable, and we English teachers like to have time with our students outside of the classroom environment. (I don&#8217;t know if the Korean teachers do because they have so much more work to do when it comes to field trips!) Most of us agreed to go on the field trip. It would be fun. But then our co-worker Alex said, &#8220;It&#8217;s just tempting to have that three-day weekend.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Did somebody say, &#8220;Three-day weekend&#8221;? Even though Alex ended up cementing his decision to explore the forest with the students, those words eventually led Ashley and me to putting ourselves on the short list of teachers opting to sit this one out. The head English teacher was the only other name on that list.</p>\n<p>But we didn&#8217;t exactly stay home. While our school was exploring the land of trees, Ashley and I were exploring the land of shopping. We decided to go to Seoul on Sunday and stay until Monday afternoon, taking the 4:25 train back to Gwangcheon so that Ashley could still attend her women&#8217;s prayer group meeting at 8:00. (We returned to Gwangcheon at 7:00, carried our purchases back to our apartment by 7:10, and rested for about 15 minutes before heading to catch the 7:30 bus to Hongseong.)</p>\n<p>We have open class coming up next week (meaning parents will come and watch our modified and not-really-representative classes), and this brief trip to Seoul was a kind of pamper preparation for that stressful event. Last week we turned in our lesson plans for open class, and it was very good to have this outing to both celebrate that benchmark and to pause before the next stretch of work to be done. We bought a few new items of clothing, and I was excited to find a regular store that has a few things my size, although it&#8217;s also possible to go to the &#8220;big size&#8221; stores in Itaewon.</p>\n<p>The other wonderful thing about visiting Seoul was the food. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ve said it several times before how much I enjoy Korean food, but sometimes I need something different. Like a proper hamburger. Sure, I can go to Lotteria (the Korean version of McDonald&#8217;s, although they also have McDonald&#8217;s, but in fewer places) if I want a burger. There&#8217;s one in Hongseong, but I refuse to eat their hamburgers. On a rare occasion, I enjoy their chicken burgers. But there&#8217;s something way off about their beef patties. Burger N Shake near the theater does a better job at hamburgers, but they, too, are a fast food joint. The hamburgers I&#8217;m after when I haven&#8217;t had one in a while (which, as it turns out, is the point when I covetously see people eating Lotteria burgers) are the homemade kind or the kind of hamburgers that look like this:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/2013-10-20-15-07-23.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image\" id=\"i-3356\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/2013-10-20-15-07-23.jpg?w=650\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/2013-10-20-15-07-09.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image\" id=\"i-3358\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/2013-10-20-15-07-09.jpg?w=650\" /></a></p>\n<p>The first one was the &#8220;Fireball&#8221; that I ate, and the second one was the &#8220;Chili Burger&#8221; that Ashley had. They were quite delicious. If you&#8217;re reading this in Korea and want to know of a good burger shack, try Chili King in Itaewon.</p>\n<p>We also ate at a standard Korean fried chicken house and VIPS, a Western-style buffet. Food is my favorite, so I had a good time.</p>\n<p>Finally, our last stop was the Foreign Food Mart. One of our friends is a student from India who is taking classes in baking. He is an awesome cook. Recently, he made some killer hummus. I used to make hummus from time to time, but that was before I came to Korea. I asked him where he found garbanzo beans and tahini in Korea. So he told me about the Foreign Food Mart, where I could get chick peas in a can or dry. (He recommended getting them dry because they are cheaper and only need boiling. I agreed because they would also weigh less without the cans and water.) So we visited the Foreign Food Mart, collected a few bags of chick peas and other things (such as green beans, which Ashley has been craving and are not available in our region). I&#8217;m going to try making the tahini myself, as Ripul says it&#8217;s just a matter of roasting sesame seeds and grinding them with oil. Sounds easy enough. I don&#8217;t know when I&#8217;m going to try making hummus, but now I have the ingredients.</p>\n<p>Hmmm, this blog post seems to have turned into an entry about food. Well, what can I say?</p>\n<p>No, really, what can I say?

A large percentage of passenger and cargo trains were canceled, including the one I had booked from Gwangcheon to Yongsan Station in Seoul, the train that we would take to start our winter vacation&#8217;s journey.

In an effort to not fill a quarter of our suitcase&#8217;s space and a tenth of its weight allowance with my bulky winter coat, I wore four layers. TOASTY!</p></div>\n<p>This was, by the way, Day 1 of our vacation. Friday the 20th was our last day of work for the year. I suppose you could call Friday Day 1\u2014after all, we could have left then\u2014but we started traveling on Saturday. Let&#8217;s call that Day 1.</p>\n<p>It was a short day, in terms of our journey. It started with three hours left in the day, and by the end of those three hours, we were checking into a budget hotel in Seoul. We stayed there for about six hours, leaving around six am of Day 2. We rode a cab to Seoul Station and took the Airport Express train to Incheon International Airport.</p>\n<p>There, we had our first snag. You see, we didn&#8217;t have return tickets. We had a one-way ticket to our destination. If that destination were to our home country or the country we have work visas for, no big deal. But if those conditions aren&#8217;t met, airlines get nervous. If we get to Cambodia and they say, &#8220;You&#8217;re not welcome,&#8221; the airline has to foot the bill to get us out. They were liable for allowing an unqualified passenger to obtain boarding passes. (This is the way I understand it from various travel sites and blogs.)</p>\n<p>In truth, we already had visas to Cambodia. They just weren&#8217;t in our passports. Instead, the Cambodian government allows people of several countries to apply for visas online and print them at home, even in black and white. We had copies of those in our backpacks in case we needed to use them. Instead, the desk attendant asked if we had a return flight from Cambodia.</p>\n<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; we said, and she looked a little nervous. Then we told her that we had a different flight. I opened my backpack and pulled out my copy of our plan (we have two copies, just in case). This plan was a clear plastic file with about 30 pieces of paper in it, in order of need for the most part. I had the train tickets to Yongsan, the hotel reservation voucher for our night in Seoul, copies of our passports, the email print-off including our flight information, the entry copies of our e-visas, the hotel voucher for our stay in Cambodia, the exit copies of our e-visas, and so on. I pulled out relevant portions of this plan and showed them to the attendant. There were train tickets from Thailand to Malaysia, and there was a sheet for obtaining our flight tickets from Malaysia back to Korea.</p>\n<p>The only thing missing was any proof of onward travel leaving Cambodia. &#8220;We&#8217;ll be taking a bus,&#8221; I said. There are no rail lines currently operating in Cambodia, after all. The desk attendant looked a little concerned, and as I said, we had the e-visas as well, but she printed our boarding passes and gave them to us.</p>\n<p>Security, as usual in Korea, took all of ten minutes. I didn&#8217;t mean &#8220;all&#8221; literally there. Our flight to Ho Chi Minh City was a standard, on-time flight. Going through security in Vietnam took all of five minutes, and I&#8217;m using that expression just the same as at the beginning of this paragraph. I don&#8217;t know if they only did it as a formality, knowing we&#8217;d been screened in Korea, or if Vietnam&#8217;s security is easier to deal with than any other country I&#8217;ve been to. I plopped my bag onto the conveyor belt, walked through the detector, and retrieved my bag. Didn&#8217;t even take the laptop out of it.</p>\n<p>Then we waited for our one-hour flight to Siem Reap, Cambodia. We ordered a late lunch. I know it was airport food, but it was pho that was actually from Vietnam! I love pho, but I&#8217;ve only had it at a couple of restaurants in Korea. Look at it:</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_3397\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/2013-12-22-15-11-47.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-3397\" alt=\"Yummy pho.\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/2013-12-22-15-11-47.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Yummy pho.</p></div>\n<p>There were some kind of leaves in it that I&#8217;ve never had in Korea. They were delicious. I even just dipped them lightly in the sauce and enjoyed them.</p>\n<p>Anyway, our flight was delayed. At first it was delayed by 70 minutes (although it wasn&#8217;t listed as delayed, so maybe it was an updated time, since the updated time was even on the boarding passes we were given in Korea), and then by another 30 (this time it was marked as delayed). I started to worry for the tuk-tuk driver who would be waiting for us at Siem Reap International Airport. Would the hotel check the flight status and wait to send him? Or would he be waiting there for the extra 100 minutes, plus however long it would take for us to taxi back to the airport after landing, deboard the plane, get through immigration, wait for our luggage, and clear customs?</p>\n<p>He was waiting there the whole time. He smiled exhaustedly when Ashley saw him holding a paper with my name on it. But even that is getting ahead of myself. What I want to say is that Siem Reap International Airport is great. It&#8217;s just one long building with a big airplane parking lot. After leaving the runway, the pilot drove the plane to this parking lot, parked the plane, and we go out with those drivable staircases. We walked into the building. And we had e-visas, so we didn&#8217;t have to apply for a visa on arrival. We were through immigration less than two minutes after stepping off the plane. We only had to wait for our bag and to clear cus\u2014Well, would you look at that? We didn&#8217;t have to clear customs at all. There was no one at that desk, so we all just walked right on by.</p>\n<p>We rode Mr. G&#8217;s tuk-tuk\u2014Ashley thinks they&#8217;re superfun\u2014to our hotel. He dropped us off and asked us what time he should pick us up to take us to Angkor Wat the next day. We settled on a time and checked in to our room.</p>\n<p>The next day, Day 3, we did not go to Angkor Wat. Instead, we went to Tonle Sap, a large lake near Siem Reap (and several other places in Cambodia). We took a boat trip around part of the lake, and we saw the floating village. Perhaps there are more, but we saw one. It was a village, and it floated on the water.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_3399\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/img_4707.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-3399\" alt=\"LIke this.\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/img_4707.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">LIke this.</p></div>\n<p>Behind Ashley, those houses are just floating on the water.

They always say, &#8216;Dolla, dolla,&#8217; but if you give them a dollar, they think they can just get money like that. Those children stop going to school. Then they are stuck.&#8221; Well, I don&#8217;t have such an awesome memory, so that&#8217;s a paraphrase. He said that a better thing to do is to go to the market, buy food, and give it to the teacher at the school. Then the students have to go to school, but you still help out. This is in line with things I&#8217;ve read about charity in Cambodia before coming. So they asked us if we wanted to buy some rice for the students and we agreed that it was a good idea. We got to take it to the school and give it to the children, so we saw directly where that rice went and whom it would help.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_3402\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/img_4704.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-3402\" alt=\"Oh, and Ashley held a snake.

Mr. G took us to the Angkor National Museum next and said he&#8217;d be back around 4:00 to take us to the hotel for a rest. I don&#8217;t have pictures of inside the museum, of course, but it was good. There was quite a bit to see. It started off with the Gallery of 1,000 Buddha Images, which is exactly what it sounds like. Then there were things about Cambodia&#8217;s history, the temples, the kings, the historical beliefs of the Khmer (Cambodian) people, etc. Fascinating stuff (especially seeing many depictions of Buddha sitting atop a seven-headed serpent), but eventually our hunger overpowered our interest in museums. We powered through the last three rooms and went next door to get a late lunch, nearly seven hours after our light breakfast.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_3409\" style=\"width: 235px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/img_4729.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-3409\" alt=\"Here's what I ate.

For a couple of hours. Mr. G. asked us if we wanted to go to Angkor Mondial Restaurant, one of the dinner-and-a-show places that features Apsara dancers. We had heard about these and wanted to go, so we said yes. We went at 6:00 and he dropped us off. He had called ahead, so we had a table reserved for us in the front, rather than arriving later and sitting who knows where. It was very nice: a large buffet and a show of traditional Apsara dancers. (Not entirely traditional, though. Women had bare chests in the Angkorian Era, it seems, but modern Cambodian culture is much more conservative.)</p>\n<p>The show mostly featured female dancers, although it included some scenes with male dancers as well. Ashley took a brief view of the female portion of the dance.

If you ever have occasion to be in Cambodia, you should see them all. There is so much more to see than Angkor Wat, which is a Hindu temple that was refashioned into a Buddhist temple, or Wat, before it began to crumble into ruin. Thanks to the Khmer kings\u2014who\u00a0each felt it was his duty to build magnificent stone temples\u2014it seems ruined temples are everywhere in Cambodia.</p>\n<p>We bought three-day passes that allowed us access to the ruins. The passes were non-transferrable, and were made official by our mugshots printed on them. We had read that one day would not be enough to see all there was to see and that a three day pass was better, but now, after the allotted time is up, I feel that three days was not enough. The passes allowed us to visit ruins not only in Siem Reap but also Phnom Kulen National Park, with a nice hike and a waterfall that tumbles over broken ruins, a botanical garden, and temple ruins over an hour away by tuk tuk.\u00a0 (Riding in the tuk tuk was one of my favorite things about Cambodia.)</p>\n<p>Concerned about cost, we toured the temples without hiring a guide. Although we did catch tidbits of what other tourists\u2019 guides were telling them, which helped us to unravel some mysteries. It also helped that we had first visited the Angkor National Museum, which gave us some insight into the history of the culture and religion of the Angkor period. Apparently, much of the information from this empire was lost. No written records, beyond those etched in stone, survived in Cambodia. If it weren\u2019t for Chinese diplomats who visited and wrote about the golden cities, there would be nothing written to help people understand what the Khmer empire was like in its day.</p>\n<p>I had never before seen something over a thousand years old and so far removed from my Western cultural context. It was a fascinating experience that submerged me in history. I kept dreaming that the halls were filled with monks, and the buildings new, even though I could see the gaping holes in the ceiling and tumbled stone. I kept thinking about how much devotion and effort it must have taken to build and sculpt the intricate designs that cover the pillars, entryways, and window frames. On the walls of Angkor Wat, and other ruins, mythology and history are carved in bas-relief. Who carved these works of art? What were they thinking about as they worked? The faces and bodies of women dancing are etched into the rock. Many of the faces seem unique rather than duplicates. Did women the artists knew inspire them?</p>\n<p>I kept thinking, too, about the significance of the sites we were treading, many of them had only been open to monks and kings. If the empire hadn\u2019t crumbled, we would never have been allowed to see any of these places. What would the kings of the great Khmer empire have thought about foreigners and the uninitiated trampling over the ruins of their most sacred places? How would they have felt about the children of their descendants begging and hawking their wares on the steps?</p>\n<p>We spent almost five hours visiting Angkor Wat itself. It is an impressive temple, and amidst the signs of decay\u2014decapitated Buddha images, carvings with faces that have been lopped off and stolen, and colonies of bats\u2014people still worship, offering incense to the images. It is mind-boggling that the temple, though it is toppling and ruined, is still so beautiful. It stands out against the jungle, commanding attention. To me it said: \u201cLook what grandeur humans have built, and see how time has destroyed it.\u201d</p>\n<p>We toured many temples and sites: Preah Khan, Neak Pean, Ta Som (with invading tree), East Mebon (with elephant statues), Pre Rup, Angkor Wat, Angkor Thom (ancient capital city, full of faces), Bayon, and Banteay Srei (ornate red sandstone).\u00a0We missed out on several more of the temples including the famous Ta Prohm that has wonderful intertwining trees. There just wasn\u2019t enough time to see everything. I hope that we will have a chance to visit the ruins again. If so, I think we\u2019ll get a week long pass and hire guides to lead us through some of the historical complexity.</p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\">And now, for the

Our Angkor Wat passes were now invalid. We had received three hole punches. We took a shorter trip to the small, outdoor War Museum. I learned a lot more about the civil wars in the \u201870s from our tour guide, who was a kind and friendly man. He showed us the guns, tanks, helicopters, mortar shells, landmines, and other instruments of death and destruction used in Cambodia\u2019s recent, violent past. He explained the differences between various landmines. The plastic kind that don\u2019t wear out from rain and time. The kind that are designed just to blow off a leg. The kind that are designed to spray shrapnel, that blind or kill. The kind that are safe to walk on, designed to target tanks and cars and requiring more weight to trigger. The kind that are tied together with trip wires to blow up around the entire perimeter of a water source, preventing the common people from safely accessing our most precious resource. He explained how the rate of landmine and other old weapon accidents decreased over the years, but was very high even decades after the war. Some children would play with the small shells they found, thinking they looked like toys to be thrown on the ground, only to have those \u201ctoys\u201d explode. Many children, he said, did not know about the landmines or where they could be found. \u201cIncluding me,\u201d he said, lifting up his pant leg and showing us the plastic replacement beneath. He was a soldier in the 90s, he said, when that happened. He has a calm attitude about it, though. He feels more strongly about the landmines that blind or kill people. He went through losing a leg to a landmine, but he can still work. In fact, he said, for some jobs (such as working at the War Museum), you have to be a landmine survivor. In any case, I think landmines are especially heinous. A gun, a tank, or a helicopter is removed from the land when the battle is over, when the soldier wielding it leaves. A landmine is not.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/img_5130.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3598\" alt=\"IMG_5130\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/img_5130.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/img_5131.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3599\" alt=\"IMG_5131\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/img_5131.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/img_5132.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3600\" alt=\"IMG_5132\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/img_5132.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\n<p>On Friday afternoon we simply took a walk. Mr. G dropped us off in the downtown area and we explored. I really like Siem Reap. It is far different from any other city I\u2019ve been in. (In fact, I\u2019ve seen Siem Reap referred to both as a city and as a town.) It has a very special character. The atmosphere is nice. The downtown area is bustling, but the buildings don\u2019t reach to the skies. Most restaurants have indoor and outdoor seating, and there are plants everywhere. Just outside the downtown area, things get more rural. It\u2019s dusty and dirty, but there are trees. Oh the trees. Beautiful trees. Here you can see houses built on stilts, houses made with whatever materials were available, houses that make no attempt to be airtight. One day, Mr. G asked us if there was snow in our home country. \u201cYes,\u201d we said. \u201cIn Cambodia, if there is snow, all die!\u201d he said. The houses are open. The warm breeze comes in. Snow indeed, and the cold it accompanies, would be a terrible thing. But as it is, the weather is friendly for such living. It\u2019s wonderful. We are not looking forward to returning to winter.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/img_5114.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3592\" alt=\"IMG_5114\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/img_5114.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/img_5112.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3590\" alt=\"IMG_5112\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/img_5112.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/img_5138.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3603\" alt=\"IMG_5138\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/img_5138.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/img_5139.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3604\" alt=\"IMG_5139\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/img_5139.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/img_5144.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3608\" alt=\"IMG_5144\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/img_5144.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/img_5146.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3610\" alt=\"IMG_5146\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/img_5146.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/img_5152.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3613\" alt=\"IMG_5152\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/img_5152.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\n<p>Saturday was our last full day in Cambodia. We rested in our hotel. We took a walk to the river. We sat by the river. In the evening, we went to one more restaurant to eat one more Khmer dish. We really enjoyed eating Khmer food. They have curry with coconut milk and various herbs and leaves that I don\u2019t even know the names of, but that make the soups taste like a tropical island. They have sour spicy soup. They have specially seasoned beef. They have fried noodles. They have amok (steam-cooked curry in banana leaves with a meat or other protein). It\u2019s very good.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/img_5150.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3611\" alt=\"IMG_5150\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/img_5150.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/img_5155.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3616\" alt=\"IMG_5155\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/img_5155.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/img_5159.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3618\" alt=\"IMG_5159\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/img_5159.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/img_4855.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3482\" alt=\"IMG_4855\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/img_4855.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/img_4854.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3481\" alt=\"IMG_4854\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/img_4854.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<p>The next day we would be crossing the border into Thailand, so part of that day would be spent in Cambodia. However, I want to write a separate entry for Day 9. Here, instead, I\u2019ll sum up our stay in Cambodia, touching on the things we didn\u2019t mention from the previous days and offering some general reactions.</p>\n<p><strong>What else did we do?</strong></p>\n<p>We saw Phare, the Cambodian Circus, performed by students under the support of the Phare Ponleu Selpak, which you can read about <a title=\"Phare - The Cambodian Circus\" href=\"http://www.pharecambodiancircus.org/circus/about-phare/our-social-mission/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\u00a0We drank smoothies and shakes at Sister Srey Caf\u00e9, which supports Cambodian students (and has really delicious caramel shakes!). We ate lots of Khmer food (so Ashley ordered lamb chops once because she just can\u2019t pass that up, especially when they were only $14, but in general we tried to eat the food of the region, since we\u2019d only be there a short time).\u00a0 We generally had a good time.</p>\n<p><strong>And what about Cambodia?</strong></p>\n<p>Cambodia is beautiful. It\u2019s so green. Yes, Siem Reap is kind of dirty. There\u2019s trash along some of the streets, especially outside downtown (but also in the downtown area). But it\u2019s beautiful. And the people are so friendly. They have good attitudes. Maybe the tour guide on our Tonle Sap boat ride was a bit bitter about his country\u2019s government, but even he was very friendly and funny.</p>\n<p>Since our hotel was not downtown, in fact a twenty-minute walk from downtown, many tuk tuk drivers didn\u2019t know where it was. The hotel card was all in English too, and didn\u2019t have an actual address, but just an area. So that was minimal help in pointing the drivers in the right direction. One friendly driver had a hard time finding the place. He asked another driver if he knew where it was. The other driver mixed up Siem Reap Niche Hotel with La Niche d\u2019Angkor Boutique Hotel, so we went roundabout awhile. He continued to search for and ask about Siem Reap Niche Hotel, showing various people the card and asking for help. As we drove down a dark, deserted road, he said, \u201cI WILL find your hotel, even until morning!\u201d</p>\n<p>Of course, not every person you meet will give you a positive encounter. There are, of course, those who are trying to sell you something. And they are very persistent. At nearly every temple and site there are women and children trying to sell scarves (the decorative kind), dresses, magnets, postcards, and other souvenirs. Some men try to sell books and services as tour guides. The women tried to sell Ashley various clothes. \u201cYou buy from me, leh-DEEE [lady]. Five dollar. I give you good prai [price].\u201d At the last temple we visited, Banteay Srei, as soon as we entered the path that leads to the site, a young boy said to me, \u201cGive me a dollar!\u201d WHAT? You\u2019re not even selling me something? Well I guess he was, but he said the completely wrong thing. Remembering what our Tonle Sap tour guide said about giving children money, I said to him, \u201cGo to school.\u201d (It was just past noon.) He tried to sell me postcards and said, \u201cYou buy and give me a dollar, I go to school in the morning.\u201d Little hustler. At the market buying fruit one day, a little girl saw us and said, \u201cOne dollar, sir.\u201d Then she realized she didn\u2019t have anything to sell us and went away.</p>\n<p>Before we came, we read that Cambodia was very cheap. And in a way, it is. We stayed at a nice hotel for around $23 a night. (So what if we shared our room with a gecko? It stayed out of our way.) A few restaurants had meals for as low as three dollars (although we didn\u2019t always want those places). Yet somehow, Cambodia is also a bit expensive (compared to its cheap reputation). Ashley overheard someone say that five or ten years ago, the attitudes of the people were more genuine. Now tourists are seen as people with bottomless wallets. A lot of people, from what we\u2019d read online, thought Thailand to be more expensive than Cambodia, but even some Cambodians we met said the opposite.</p>\n<p>I talked about some of the negative things of Cambodia here in the wrap-up, but please don\u2019t be dissuaded from visiting. Like I said, it\u2019s a beautiful, beautiful country, with beautiful people. So some of them are trying to sell you something. That\u2019s true of any place. So some of them will try to rip you off. That\u2019s true of any place, too. The food is good, the sites are thought-provoking, and it certainly is possible to visit on a budget, as long as you guard yourself from scams, bargain at the markets, and don\u2019t buy any good or service you hadn\u2019t planned on before arriving. In fact, sometimes we didn\u2019t even have to bargain. We bought a large package of dried mango. We asked the women how much it would cost. \u201cSix dollar,\u201d she said, and Ashley and I looked at each other. We had just walked up to the stall, so we weren\u2019t even sure we wanted to buy mango. While we were considering whether we even wanted it or not, the woman must have thought we were hesitant about the price. \u201cFour dollar,\u201d she said, not five seconds later. \u201cI give you discount, four dollar.\u201d Well, then, okay! (And that kind of thing happened a lot. Just look hesitant about the first offer and they will reduce it for you right away.)</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/img_4809.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3467\" alt=\"IMG_4809\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/img_4809.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 3587, "location": false, "date": "01-06-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p><em>[Note: I wrote this when I wrote the previous entry, but I didn\u2019t want to overwhelm anyone with too many posts. So I didn\u2019t post it, but then I forgot about it. Sorry.]</em></p>\n<p>On Sunday the 29th, we left Cambodia. We woke up early, packed up all our stuff, ate breakfast, and checked out of the hotel. At 8:00, we boarded a bus to Bangkok. (Actually, it was around 8:30 because the first bus got full, so another bus had to come for the remaining travelers.) The bus made a rest stop halfway to the border, and we bought some pineapple and little pastries. Those treats were the last things we ate in Cambodia.</p>\n<p>And then we left Cambodia. We stood for quite a while in a line to reach the departure desk, where officials put exit stamps in our passports. That was not the stressful part.</p>\n<p>The stressful part was next: getting into Thailand. Remember how I mentioned that the desk attendant at the airport was concerned about how I would leave Cambodia? Well, I had read online that Thailand also has a similar concern. US citizens (and citizens of many other countries) can receive a visa exemption. That means we don\u2019t need a visa to enter the country, we can just enter, and we\u2019ll have 15-30 days (depending on our nationality) to stay in Thailand. There are some rules, however. We have to have proof of onward travel, and we have to have enough money to support our stay.</p>\n<p>Online, most people said that immigration officials, who just want to stamp people in so tourists will spend money in the country, wouldn\u2019t really apply the onward travel rule. It\u2019s more enforced by the airlines, who don\u2019t want to foot the bill for someone who has to be ejected from the country. Still, there was the occasional story of someone being denied access.</p>\n<p>What really bugged me about the situation, and seemed to be a big concern on the Internet, was that all the information seemed to conflict with each other, that Thai immigration laws are always changing. One embassy\u2019s site will say that proof of onward travel is any plane, bus, train, or boat ticket. Another embassy will say that only air travel is accepted as proof.</p>\n<p>Well, we like trains, and we weren\u2019t planning on flying from Thailand to Malaysia. We had our train tickets so that we\u2019d have proof, in case we were asked, but what if the immigration officials enforced the strange rule of air travel only? (It didn\u2019t seem likely, because we were crossing into Thailand by land, but the possibility of it and the absurdity of the rules stressed me out.)</p>\n<p>But it was no trouble. They didn\u2019t even ask for proof of onward travel at all.</p>\n<p>And we were now in Thailand. First order of business? Find a bathroom. What we learned was that public toilets in Thailand often carry a fee. We would need 3 baht to use the toilet (or about nine cents). That means we\u2019d need some baht. So I had to find a currency exchange booth (which wasn\u2019t hard).</p>\n<p>Next order of business? Wait for the next minibus to Bangkok. Right there near our line was a vendor selling fruit. We bought another bag of pineapple (the woman cut it up for us and included two sticks for spearing the fruit). So one of the last things we ate in Cambodia was pineapple, and the first thing we ate in Thailand was pineapple.</p>\n<p>Another minibus finally came and we got in. We thought we\u2019d have to wait for yet one more, because we weren\u2019t near the front of the line, but then one of the people who oversees the loading of passengers saw that we were together and had just one bag. \u201cOne bag two people? Come with me.\u201d We got the last two seats on that bus, next to the sliding door and the dense pile of luggage. (So actually, we had the best seats, while the other people sat three or four in a row.)</p>\n<p>It was a long ride, about four hours, but we made it safely to Bangkok. Next we\u2019d need a cab to our hotel. We saw a small group of tourists talk to a cab driver, who then drove away without the tourists. I spoke up and asked the man what he said to the cab driver. I already read that you need to make sure cab drivers in Bangkok use the meter, because some will try to quote you a higher price. But I didn\u2019t know what way to say these things, so I asked a fellow traveler.</p>\n<p>Armed with this information, I hailed a taxi. He rolled down the window and I asked, \u201cMeter?\u201d He said no, so I walked away. I hailed another cab. He rolled down his window and I asked, \u201cMeter?\u201d He said, \u201cWhere to?\u201d I pulled out the hotel voucher and pointed at the address, saying, \u201cHere.\u201d He looked at it, trying to read the English (even though the Thai was just beneath it), then said, \u201cTwo hundred baht.\u201d I asked for the meter and again he said no.</p>\n<p>So I hailed another cab. This time, he was willing to use the meter. Did it come close to 200 baht? No. Once we reached our destination, the meter read 77 (about $2.33). That is cheap. South Korea\u2019s taxis, by what everyone from America or Ireland or the UK or Australia or any other country says, are cheap, but even their starting price is around what we paid for the full trip.</p>\n<p>Even 200 baht is only about $6. Why not just take that offer when we need to get from Point A to Point B? For one, that was more than double the fair price. For two, I\u2019d just read the day before that it\u2019s not only bad for tourists, but it\u2019s also bad for locals. Many Thai citizens in Bangkok have a hard time hailing cabs, especially in touristy areas. The cab drivers know that they can get about 200-300% more by carrying foreigners. So the Thai people (except cab drivers) also want foreigners to get the fair price.</p>\n<p>So I felt pretty good after that. We\u2019d successfully stood up for ourselves and weakened the grip, however slightly, of scamming greed in the beautiful Kingdom of Thailand. This pride, of course, would be equally countered the next day in Hua Hin. There are only a few metered taxis in that city. Mostly you travel by a small-bed truck version of a tuk tuk. I read that you should haggle the prices of tuk tuks, starting at about 50% of their offer until you reach an agreement. Well, I think that\u2019s mostly for Bangkok, where transportation is more plentiful. I tried to bargain with a tuk tuk driver, offering 120 instead of the 200 he quoted. He refused. Even when I agreed to 200, he wanted nothing to do with me. So we had to find another driver, and I realized then that, especially with our out-of-the-way location, we were in no position to bargain. We\u2019d take whatever prices we could. (And, with one small exception later in the week, they were fair prices anyway.)</p>\n<p>So I got a bit ahead of myself there. I talked about our stay in Thailand beyond Day 9 a bit. But that\u2019s okay. I\u2019m going to break from a strictly chronological method of telling you all about our vacation. Instead of doing that, we\u2019ll more likely write things such as \u201cFood in Thailand,\u201d \u201cThe Views of Penang Island,\u201d and so on. It\u2019s kind of boring for me to write our vacation entirely chronologically, and I imagine it wouldn\u2019t be good to read it that way, either. So we\u2019ve finished three weeks of traveling in Southeast Asia, and over the next few weeks we\u2019ll write some things about our experiences there.</p>\n", "post_id": 3736, "location": false, "date": "01-16-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>So a lot has happened, and it has made me forget about finishing up the posts on our winter vacation. What has happened? Well, we moved into a new apartment. There will be a post about that after we have everything put in place and whatnot. Also, our school had to change its curriculum because of some politics&#8211;both the government kind and the not-government kind. So we had to make a few big changes to our schedules and classes. That should be interesting. Also, four of our friends are leaving this month, in less than two weeks, so we&#8217;ve been busy trying to see them as much as possible before they go, the Canadians to Thailand to volunteer and take a special course, and the South Africans to Greece and other countries to work on a farm and do other work-travel stuff. Doesn&#8217;t that sound cool?</p>\n<p>Anyway, we&#8217;ve written about Cambodia and Thailand, so that leaves Malaysia. I&#8217;ll just say a few things because I have quite a bit to do today, and I fear if I don&#8217;t finish this today you won&#8217;t see it ever.</p>\n<p>Malaysia Malaysia Malaysia. It is\u00a0<em>hot</em> in Malaysia. Of course, we were only three degrees north of the equator, so that could explain some of it.</p>\n<p>What did we eat in Malaysia? I imagine we ate something that was traditionally Malay at one point, but we ate, for the most part, Indian food. We also ate some Western food because we had tried so many others things already and, sometimes, we just wanted to make a quick decision. Malaysia is a very mixed place. There are Malays, Indians, Chinese, and other ethnicities living there. The nation is Islam but it&#8217;s a small majority and several other faiths are practiced freely there. But since the government is Islamic, many chain restaurants cater to Muslims. People eat pork in Malaysia, but Muslims don&#8217;t. That&#8217;s how we ate at a Pizza Hut that served beef or chicken pepperoni, and how I ate a beef bacon burger at Chili&#8217;s.</p>\n<p>And we love Indian food. Our most interesting experience was walking over to Little India and trying to find a place to eat. We chose the wrong place. We walked into a place full of Indians. There was a buffet bar type thing and it seemed that everyone had a different style plate. We weren&#8217;t sure if it was actually a buffet, though, or a cafeteria-style place, where you load your tray and then pay. Observing was only somewhat helpful. We asked the cashier and she told us, but it was hard to hear over all the noise and I still wasn&#8217;t sure. We sat down and ordered fried rice and wondered if we were then supposed to add meat and veggies from the bar ourselves. But the rice was delicious!</p>\n<p>Anyway, that awkward and confusing experience is why we ate the next day at comfortable, familiar Chili&#8217;s.</p>\n<p>It was also fun to eat at the Red Garden Food Court. You go, you sit down, someone asks you if you want anything to drink, and then you go to any of the dozens of food stalls that surround the area and order what you want. And because of the high multiculturalism of Malaysia, there&#8217;s plenty to choose from.</p>\n<p>Also, prices in Malaysia are amazing. Once, when we had eaten lunch late and Ashley wasn&#8217;t hungry enough for supper, I went out alone and just went to a place near the hotel. I walked in and a friendly man showed me how to order. I chose a rice and a topping (a chicken curry) and then, if I wanted, I could choose some fruits from a display case. Whatever fruits I chose would be freshly squeezed into juice. The total was the equivalent of about $4 for my entire, filling meal. I thought I&#8217;d be lucky to have the fresh fruit juice alone for that price in the States or Korea.</p>\n<p>I have a few words to say about shopping in Malaysia. Boy do they like shopping. They must, because their malls are everywhere, and they are huge. We got off the Monorail while going to see a popular area and the platform went straight into the 3rd or 4th floor of a 6-floor mall. Each floor goes in a square around the open middle, but there are also off-chutes that lead, I think, to a second surrounding square. I wasn&#8217;t sure. I was rather confused by the layout (probably from the overwhelming vastness of it all).</p>\n<p>What else do I have to say about Malaysia before I talk about how beautiful it is? Well, I might as well mention that. We took a train from Thailand to Malaysia, and from one place to another within Malaysia. Now, Cambodia and Thailand are beautiful countries, but on the train in Malaysia, we constantly saw forests made of palm and coconut trees. I have never seen anything like it. Malaysia is so green, and green is my favorite color. As we rode the train and looked out the window, I wondered at how many hundreds, how many thousands, how many hundreds of thousands of trees we must be passing by. Even in the cities, there is a lot of green.</p>\n<p>We took the subway and then walked to the Kuala Lumpur Bird Park in the capital city (Kuala Lumpur), which is the world&#8217;s largest free-flight walk-in aviary. Tons of birds and beautiful scenery. We really enjoyed it there, although it rained toward the end of our stay so we hurried it along quicker than we probably would have. It was a light rain, though.</p>\n<p>A few other tidbits:</p>\n<p>Blind people. We saw a lot of them (a <em>lot</em> of them), even crossing the street together, guided by the one in front and the beeping sound of the crosswalk light. I saw a few signs for massage parlors that advertised &#8220;blind masseurs,&#8221; so that might have something to do with it.</p>\n<p>Buses. I don&#8217;t like them as much as buses in Korea. They&#8217;re cheap, and you only pay by distance, but I never figured out how to figure out my distance. We just paid the lowest rate, so I hope that was okay.</p>\n<p>Taxis. It&#8217;s illegal for the taxi driver not to use the meter, but they still don&#8217;t use the meter. You have to negotiate your price up front. Fortunately, they are usually reasonable. When we stayed on Penang Island, we stayed in a place that&#8217;s still kind of in development, so drivers didn&#8217;t know where to take us. However, one driver did. He told us up front it would be 20 ringgit (just a bit over $6 US). His meter started automatically and sure enough, when we arrived at our place, it was 20 ringgit.</p>\n<p>Also taxis. Or rather not-taxis. We went to the bus terminal to take a bus back to our area. One man was asking if we needed a taxi and offered to take us for 15 ringgit (a very good price from where we were). We said no. Then we asked when bus 11 was next going and they told us another 30 minutes. So we told the man, &#8220;Okay, let&#8217;s go.&#8221; He led us to the street and we passed a cab. We passed another cab. We approached the last cab and I thought, <em>This is his.</em> We passed that cab and then man opened the door of a very old car. We prayed to the L<span style=\"font-size:xx-small;\">ORD</span>\u00a0for safety and got in the car. It was difficult for him to find, but eventually he took us to where we wanted to go. Praise the L<span style=\"font-size:xx-small;\">ORD\u00a0</span>we made it! We think he just saw some foreigners and thought, <em>Hey, I can make a few easy bucks!</em> (Or, you know, ringgit.) He was very friendly.<span style=\"font-size:xx-small;\"><br />\n</span></p>\n<p>Friendly people. They&#8217;re everywhere in Malaysia. Our first night in Penang we got locked out of the apartment complex we were staying at. One of the security guards there taught us how to open the doors. Apparently the locks are different there. If you lock it by turning the key two full times, you have to unlock it will two full turns, and so on. The man&#8217;s name was Muru and he gave me his number in case I needed any other help.</p>\n<p>Durian. Durian is a Southeast Asian fruit famous for its taste and infamous for its smell. It was forbidden at the hotel way stayed at in Kuala Lumpur.</p>\n<p>Languages. English is common in Malaysia, especially in the cities, although it wasn&#8217;t hard to hear several other languages as well. We&#8217;re pretty certain we heard more than just Malaysian because sometimes what we heard sounded completely different. I heard one man speaking a language that was so fast, I don&#8217;t even know. It sounded like the sounds of that language naturally go well together fast, so it&#8217;s possible to speak it faster than English. Or he was just a speed-rapper by night. Maybe that&#8217;s it.</p>\n<p>Leaving the country. Our flight was at 1 AM, so we went to the airport in the evening and then, after checking in, I asked the man checking boarding passes at security if there was anything to eat beyond security. He said only Dunkin&#8217; Donuts, so we waited to go through security. Outside the airport was a food court and several places to eat. Very interesting. Also, when we were boarding our plane, some officials checked our passports and asked us all a few questions before letting us through. One man pulled me aside after another woman checked my passport and was interested in my last name. &#8220;Is it an Israeli name?&#8221; he asked. I told him it wasn&#8217;t and he asked me a few more polite questions before letting me through. That was strange. I know there are passport controversies when talking about Israel and may Muslim countries, but&#8230;I don&#8217;t know. We were leaving the country, not entering it, but I guess they are still concerned.</p>\n\n\t\t<style type='text/css'>\n\t\t\t#gallery-3740-2 {\n\t\t\t\tmargin: auto;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t#gallery-3740-2

Last week during a short trip to Seoul, we decided to try out a Thai restaurant here in Korea to re-experience the delight. Of course I was a bit disappointed. It fell short of what I&#8217;d experienced before.</p>\n<p>Anyone who knows me well enough should know that Thai food is my favorite. So, as we crossed the border into Thailand, Brian was stressed about immigration but I was anticipating the deliciousness to come. I had had Thai curries and teas in the United States, but I had not yet had &#8220;authentic&#8221; Thai food in Thailand. Let me just say that it was everything I expected, and much more flavorful and spicy! I loved it.</p>\n\n\t\t<style type='text/css'>\n\t\t\t#gallery-3742-3 {\n\t\t\t\tmargin: auto;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t#gallery-3742-3 .gallery-item {\n\t\t\t\tfloat: left;\n\t\t\t\tmargin-top:

We were in Hua Hin, Thailand, and so we were able to visit a few sights near that area. We walked on the beach, rode an elephant, saw a pineapple plantation, watched a reptile show, visited a floating market, did some shopping, and ate food at seaside restaurants. It was fantastic. I only wish we had planned to stay longer so that I could have tried a wider range of Thai dishes!

Actually, it&#8217;s an old apartment, old enough that one of the outlets fits the same kind of plugs used in the US and Canada. Apparently, as Brad told me when we were hooking up the washing machine in the utility room, where this particular outlet is located, Korea used to use Type A and B plugs a long time ago. (If you&#8217;re curious, they use C and F now, which have two round prongs instead of two flat prongs.)</span></p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s new to us, and we like it. It started when Brad said, &#8220;Brian, Ashley, can I talk to you for a minute?&#8221; We didn&#8217;t know what he was going to say. We had just returned from winter vacation to work a few days before this. We all went to an empty classroom, where Brad said, &#8220;Because you&#8217;re renewing for another year, the school has decided to give you a bigger apartment.&#8221; Well, we&#8217;ve renewed for another year once before and didn&#8217;t get a bigger apartment, so I don&#8217;t know the\u00a0<em>full</em> reason, or why this was chosen as the &#8220;reward&#8221; or &#8220;thank you,&#8221; but I&#8217;m not complaining.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a three-bedroom apartment,&#8221; Brad added.</p>\n<p><em>What?!</em> We couldn&#8217;t believe it. We&#8217;d been living in a one-room apartment for nearly two years and suddenly we have a three-bedroom apartment. We were given just over a week to pack up our stuff. In fact, English teachers usually only have to pack up their stuff when they leave Korea or move to a different town. The bed, TV, wardrobes, tables, chairs, dishes, utensils, and other things belong to the school. But we had to move all of that, too, because we&#8217;re staying at the same school.</p>\n<p>Ashley and I felt bad for the movers. In Korea, movers often use a truck with an <a title=\"Elevator ladder\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXhXmmpI8_A&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1m3s\" target=\"_blank\">elevator ladder</a>\u00a0to take stuff directly through the large front window. Some movers, I learned, will even pack, move, and unpack for you. But the movers our school hired just had a truck. No elevator ladder. Also, there is no elevator at our new apartment, and our new place is on the sixth floor. One of the two movers was angry when he found out and yelled at the school administrator. He carried some of the stuff down to the truck from our old apartment on the third floor, and then he went home. The other mover, however, was up to the challenge. He needed help with some of it, though. It took four of us to carry the large wardrobe down the stairs. (The administrator, his son, and I helped the remaining mover carry it down.)</p>\n<p>Then we went to the new apartment. Our school realized they should have hired a lift truck, so they did, and the mover didn&#8217;t have to carry anything up the 85 steps to our door. He loaded it on the platform, the platform operator sent it up, and we unloaded it in the room. It was fast and easy.</p>\n<p>The problem was that there was a big pile of stuff in the middle of the living room. The previous tenant was supposed to come get it before we moved in, but I guess he didn&#8217;t. Allegedly, he said, &#8220;Oh, just store it there.&#8221; Sorry, sir, but no. Brad told the mover to take it down the platform and&#8230;they either threw it away or held it at the school for the man to claim it. Probably the former, though.</p>\n<p>There were a few other problems, but most of them were solved. The light switches and doorknobs that needed repairs were repaired that day. The handy man even replaced a screen we hadn&#8217;t realized was broken when we were there the week before taking inventory of what needed to be done. We were supposed to get new floors, but in the end the school opted to put in new flooring for one room. We chose the bedroom, since it was to be our bedroom and the linoleum-like flooring common in Korea was warped and wrinkled in that room.</p>\n<p>There are a few downsides to our apartment:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It takes about five more minutes to walk to school.</li>\n<li>It&#8217;s on the sixth floor and has no elevator.</li>\n<li>Not all of the floors were fixed, including one room where the floor was &#8220;fixed&#8221; by throwing another layer of linoleum on top.</li>\n<li>The walls surrounding the balcony&#8217;s sliding doors/windows is visibly not square around the frame, so the doors have to be locked to get a seal, and one side doesn&#8217;t quite seal.</li>\n<li>The utility room could use painting, but it&#8217;s only a cosmetic issue.</li>\n<li>It&#8217;s bigger, so we use a lot more gas.</li>\n<li>The lock on the door is barely set correctly. The door needs to be closed as tight as possible to lock or unlock it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, these downsides are usually mitigated:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>More exercise getting to school. And five more minutes on top of five minutes is only ten minutes.</li>\n<li>More exercise going up the stairs.</li>\n<li>It&#8217;s closer to the grocery store and train station.</li>\n<li>The windows are much better. (They were small and high up in our old apartment; we couldn&#8217;t really look outside and they didn&#8217;t let much light in.)</li>\n<li>It may cost more to heat, but it&#8217;s so much more comfortable.</li>\n<li>Despite its inconveniences, the door works.</li>\n<li>The hot water works more consistently. In our old apartment, the water couldn&#8217;t decide whether to give hypothermia or third degree burns for about two minutes, and then the temperature would be stuck around just under lukewarm. Here, we have to wait a minute or so before we can make a reliable adjustment to the temperature, but once it&#8217;s set, it will stay like that, as far as we can tell, forever.</li>\n<li>Three burners on the stove instead of the standard two.</li>\n<li>A larger area to take off and put on shoes. And a cubby for the shoes, too.</li>\n<li>Three rooms means we have room for our clothes, rather than having half of them in suitcases under the bed. Also, I have a room for playing my bass guitar and writing (since it&#8217;s hard for me to concentrate on reading or writing when around other people or noises).</li>\n<li>More cupboards in our kitchen.</li>\n<li>A nice, high view of Gwangcheon, including Oseosan (Mt. Oseo, pronounced &#8220;Oh-suh&#8221;).</li>\n<li>Our bedroom isn&#8217;t cramped.</li>\n<li>In fact, no space is cramped.</li>\n<li>We can both prepare dinner at the same time instead of being in each other&#8217;s way in a narrow kitchen.</li>\n<li>We can invite our friends over.</li>\n<li>And more.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So this is a great, great place. We&#8217;re very thankful for it. When we first moved in, I would get out of bed and enter the living room and be confused. &#8220;Why aren&#8217;t I bumping into anything?&#8221; Sometimes we forget we&#8217;re in Korea because an apartment this big is just not common for English teachers in Korea. (For comparison, Brad and I estimated our old apartment, including the &#8220;balcony,&#8221; at around 300 square feet. I measured and calculated this one, and it&#8217;s just over 900. That&#8217;s about the size Ashley and I think would be good for our settle-down home. The living room itself is more than 400 square feet.)</p>\n<p>Here are some pictures of our new place:</p>\n\n\t\t<style type='text/css'>\n\t\t\t#gallery-3776-1 {\n\t\t\t\tmargin:

What have we been up to?</p>\n<p>Well, for one, we just got back from a field trip with our Sabbath school group to Gunsan. Normally, English Adventure Club ends at 11:30, but today we ended at 3:00. Our school booked an entire train car and we went to Gunsan, about an hour away, to have a picnic at a dam. It was good that, even though our group left some of the seats empty, we had the whole car to ourselves. The students had a lot of fun on the train and they were not afraid to let everyone know it. Train rides are usually quieter than that. I can only imagine what other passengers would have felt if they had been stuck with us. <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile' title=':-)'>:-)</span> Just so you know, I loved hearing all that excitement and screaming. In the classrooms it&#8217;s not fun to hear, but I loved spending time with the students on the train and outdoors, with no curriculum to get through.</p>\n<p>I really enjoy my job. English teachers in Korea often worry that they&#8217;ll be stuck here in a job that isn&#8217;t their career, but for the time being, I&#8217;m not worried about that. Actually I was just telling Ashley last night that even though this semester has been the hardest semester at our school (for reasons related to scheduling, government interference, student placement, and a few other issues I should not express so publicly), I&#8217;m actually having some of the best times of my life overall (praise God). For one, I think God has blessed me with better teaching skills. I still have a long way to go before I become a true super teacher like our friends Linda and Courtney, or like our school&#8217;s fifth grade teacher, but I&#8217;m getting better and I won&#8217;t belittle myself with false modesty on that point. I think one of the keys has been getting to know the students more.</p>\n<p>One of the things I dislike most about living in South Korea is being away from my family, especially the people in it who are growing the fastest and therefore have leaps and bounds of growing up done\u00a0between visits home. By that I mean my nieces, who are growing up so fast. The longer I&#8217;m here, the less of them I get to see (I&#8217;m glad Skype exists, though, and I should use it more often to see them). I&#8217;ve realized, though, that what Jesus said about <a title=\"Mark 10:29-30\" href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mark+10%3A29-30&amp;version=KJV\" target=\"_blank\">leaving family and receiving it a hundredfold in this life</a> is true. I miss my family back home, but for now I have such a large family. Everyone at work gets along super great, and the children&#8230;I love our students. When I first came to this school, it was a job.\u00a0I did not know these children and I did what I could for the students because that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m supposed to do. As time has gone by, however, my care for the students has multiplied, and I&#8217;m glad that God has blessed me with the chance to know them and to, I hope, be a positive influence for them. And I think that this is one of the reasons I&#8217;m a better teacher now.</p>\n<p>Another thing that has made life great despite the hardships of crazy work situations is that God has blessed me with more peace than I&#8217;ve had. It took me a long time to realize that I wasn&#8217;t always accepting the peace God was trying to give me. Lately, I&#8217;ve been feeling that peace more often. A large part of it stems from a simple decision to not dwell on negative thoughts unnecessarily, but to submit them to Christ and choose to think instead of things that are better. So if there&#8217;s a problem I have no control over and so thinking about it is a waste of my time, or if I&#8217;m annoyed, or if I&#8217;m tempted to think some other evil, I have to let Christ deal with it instead while I pray for my family, pray for my students, thank God for my blessings, think about my stories, think about what I&#8217;d like to do for my next vacation, or even just look forward to the meal Ashley and I had planned to eat. I&#8217;m not some expert at this kind of thinking, but even doing it a little is so much better than dealing with the stress that comes from negative thoughts and feelings.</p>\n<p>I mentioned my stories, and that&#8217;s something else that has made my life great and for which I can thank God. Early this year I decided to add two things to the list of required daily activities (things that are required every day are, for example, breathing, drinking water, praying, reading the Bible, and telling my wife I love her). I added playing bass guitar and writing short stories. I have missed a few days of playing my bass guitar (when I&#8217;m away from home for the weekend, for example, or that day I was sick and simply forgot), but I have not missed a day of writing, even if it was only one sentence (which is the daily minimum; five minutes of playing is the minimum for bass guitar). These hobbies have given me more joy in life, especially the writing. I take this hobby seriously. I want to get better at it. And I find, as I said, that thinking about my writing helps improve my mood.</p>\n<p>Finally, my wife and I feel like our marriage has been tightened and strengthened over time, and it was already great to begin with. We can only thank the LORD for that.</p>\n<p>That was kind of a big tangent. What else have we been up to? We visited some of the tour sites near the DMZ, which is the four kilometer-wide buffer zone that runs along the border between North Korea and South Korea. (A common misconception is that the DMZ is the border line, while it&#8217;s actually a zone that takes two kilometers from each country along the border line to make a buffer where no one can go.) One point along the tour was an observation building that was meters from the DMZ. So at that point, we were a little more than two kilometers away from North Korea. It was only too bad that the sky was hazy that day, so we couldn&#8217;t see very far into the country, even with the coin-operated binoculars. One of our friends managed to see a Korean farmer walking home, though!</p>\n<p>Probably the coolest part of the tour was going into two of the four tunnels that were discovered a few decades ago. These tunnels were dug from North Korea into South Korea in an apparent attempt to plan an attack on Seoul that never happened. It was cool not only because it was neat to see these tunnels and learn about their importance in Korean history, but also because it was underground and therefore much cooler than the hot air there was outside.</p>\n<p>We didn&#8217;t go to the most famous sites, such as Panmunjeom, which is\u00a0probably the only place where you can be within meters from the border, where the guards stand watch from both sides all day, and where some people even cross, technically, onto North Korean property in the rarely-if-ever-used conference room set up along the border for meetings. That tour is more expensive and takes more time than the tour we went with, but that&#8217;s okay. It&#8217;s also much stricter (wear nicer clothing and no pointing, for example, or you might arouse the suspicions of a North Korean officer). We learned quite a bit about Korean history and the DMZ just from the smaller tour sites we visited, and I&#8217;m glad we went. Like I said, the only disappointment was the visibility that day.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also, we went to a science museum with our school a couple of weeks ago. This field trip was held at the end of May instead of in late April or early May\u00a0because of the Sewol ferry sinking. Many people in Korea at that time called for an end of all school field trips forever, but thankfully it didn&#8217;t come to that. Most schools simply postponed their trips. We&#8217;ve also noticed an increase in safety awareness on field trips. Field trips in Korea are very carefree, but now there are more head counts, more buddy systems, and more double-checking. In addition to the field trip postponements, our school&#8217;s sports day competition was postponed. It&#8217;s usually on or around May 5 at our school, but now we&#8217;re having it in October. May 5 was considered too close to the national tragedy to be having fun and games. It was unfortunate and made a lot of people, students and teachers alike, upset, but it&#8217;s done now, so it is what it is, I guess.</p>\n<p>And finally, one of the things that stressed us out about work was that, to deal with some of the government-mandated transitional curricula changes, our school had nine hours of English-language classes when it advertises ten in its English immersion program. It decided to fill that tenth hour with &#8220;musical class.&#8221; At first I thought it meant we were getting ready really early for the English Cantabile (an English program in winter that sort of misuses an Italian word as its title and which sometimes involves the students performing a musical). Then we thought it was just a class period of singing English songs with the students. Then, it turned out, &#8220;musical&#8221; class is &#8220;drama&#8221; class, so we all had to pick a short play and have our students practice it for an upcoming event on June 27, in which parents will be invited to watch the twelve performances (two for each of the six grades at our school, since grades are divided into high and low level). There were more changes to this class than I&#8217;ve mentioned here. The most recent one was actually a relief: parents will no longer be invited to the event, so Ashley and I, who have more musical classes than any other teacher, at three each (it&#8217;s just how the scheduling worked out, I guess), won&#8217;t have to look incompetent in front of our students&#8217; parents when they see how poor the plays are. We only have this class one forty-minute class period\u00a0per week, so there&#8217;s not much time to prepare, especially when some days are holidays or classes are canceled for other reasons. Also, directing a play in a language your students aren&#8217;t 100% comfortable in is not easy at all. So now only the rest of the students will see the plays and it won&#8217;t matter\u00a0<em>as much</em>\u00a0if the students didn&#8217;t memorize their lines or anything. Our head English teacher was rather upset about the news though.\u00a0He put a lot of effort into his play and now the parents won&#8217;t be watching, so that&#8217;s a bit of a bummer.</p>\n<p>Those are some of the notable things that have been going on in our lives lately. I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s more but I can&#8217;t think about it right now. And I don&#8217;t want to make this rambling blog post any longer. So here&#8217;s the end:</p>\n<p>The End</p>\n", "post_id": 3811, "location": false, "date": "06-14-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>Today our school had its first* Drama Day. Now in the winter we always have what they call &#8220;Cantabile,&#8221; which is an Italian word that doesn&#8217;t really mean &#8220;Christmas English concert&#8221; or &#8220;winter English concert,&#8221; but that&#8217;s what it is for us. That is also a day with drama and/or music, but this Drama Day was something completely separate. It was actually for a class.</p>\n<p>Owing to some rather complex circumstances in recent government legislation and our school&#8217;s curriculum, we found ourselves short one class hour of the ten hours of English immersion education our school advertises. Each student only had nine forty-minute class periods. Our school&#8217;s solution was to add &#8220;musical&#8221; class. So now the students have the standard\u00a0English course (mandated by the government and using one of the same textbooks public schools in Korea use), language arts, conversation, and musical. After a few changes, this &#8220;musical&#8221; class turned out to be more of a &#8220;drama club&#8221; class. The school planned to have a day toward the end of the semester where parents could come and watch the students perform the plays. (First and second grade just sang songs, though.)</p>\n<p>These classes were difficult to teach, and it was a nuisance for pretty much everyone involved. We all learned (and should have known) that directing children in a second language to perform a play in that second language as second-class teachers is a game played with a stacked deck, and we&#8217;re not the dealers. Remember, also, that this is the tenth class hour for the students, so we taught this class only once a week. If there was a holiday or a national test day, we went two weeks between classes. Finally, not all of our musical classes coincided with times when there wasn&#8217;t physical education classes going on. Some of us could use the gymnasium, and some of us could not. (And if we could, the students equate the gym with running around and having fun.)</p>\n<p>Anyway, I don&#8217;t want to get too negative, so I&#8217;ll carry on. I just wanted to lightly mention some of the difficulties to explain\u00a0some background.</p>\n<p>So we all chose plays at the beginning of the semester and made copies of the scripts for our students to memorize. We spent the rest of the semester (well, until today) trying to get our students to memorize their lines, read the lines correctly, speak loudly, and perform the appropriate actions. Some of the students were excited about it, and some couldn&#8217;t care less. And it all culminated in today&#8217;s Drama Day.</p>\n<p>The high level half of the fourth grade\u00a0class was one of the classes excited about the program. Especially the girls. Last week a large group of them came to the English teachers&#8217; office and asked me if they\u00a0could wear \ud55c\ubcf5 (&#8220;hanbok,&#8221; or traditional Korean clothing).\u00a0None of the classes had been given costumes or anything, so most of the plays were largely done with imagination. The play for my fourth grade class took place in an unspecified place in a pre-industrial time, so if all the students wore hanbok**, that would make sense. I asked them, &#8220;Does everyone have a hanbok?&#8221; They said yes. I thought about it, and I decided that even though I was hesitant, the students were really excited about it. So I agreed and said we&#8217;d talk more about it on Thursday, which is the day of the week we have our class\u00a0on.</p>\n<p>Thursday was yesterday. I went to class expecting to do one last run-through of the play and to clear up any last concerns. I found out that some of the students didn&#8217;t have any hanbok. Also, one student said, &#8220;Teacher, I bought hanbok yesterday.&#8221; (Now let me tell you something: These clothes are not like going and buying a T-shirt or even a pair of jeans. It&#8217;s possible, although barely, to spend around a hundred dollars for one, but it&#8217;s more likely to cost two, three, or even seven hundred dollars.)</p>\n<p>One student said she wanted to make hanbok with her mom for the students who didn&#8217;t have one (out of paper or something, of course, but nonetheless, this girl is adorable and dedicated; she also took it upon herself to make some props for the play before I&#8217;d gotten around to the issue of props!).</p>\n<p>Alright, this is where it gets really interesting. A few weeks ago, the school told us that Drama Day wouldn&#8217;t be an open-school event anymore, but that the students would just perform for the other grades and the school staff. So I told my students that in my drama classes. &#8220;Parents aren&#8217;t coming anymore. We&#8217;re just showing the play to the school.&#8221; We also thought that the Korean homeroom teachers had informed the students of the change. Finally, just a day or two before this, we learned that Drama Day wouldn&#8217;t even be for all the school. They wanted to minimize canceled classes, so they made a schedule that involved\u00a0only parts of the school watching at any given time, so that some grades saw certain plays and other grades saw other plays.</p>\n<p>So this is when I mentioned to the students the change. I asked them if they still wanted to go through so much knowing that they wouldn&#8217;t be performing for the whole school, but just part of it. In the process of explaining this, the issue of the parents not being invited anymore came up.</p>\n<p>As it turns out, I either forgot to mention it to this particular class (I had three of these\u00a0classes) or they weren&#8217;t listening when I told them. I really thought I had told them, though (and I felt less guilty when I learned that a few of the other English teachers hadn&#8217;t said anything, expecting the Korean homeroom teachers, who normally make such announcements, had covered that base).</p>\n<p>Well, some of my students lost it. I had about five or six severely sorrowful students shedding tears left and right. Other students may not have been crying, and some seemed not to care much, but most were so sad. One girl in particular was so upset she could barely express herself in English, but kept switching to Korean (and her English is pretty darn good). She had stayed up late to make sure she had all her lines perfectly memorized. She was excited for her mom to come and watch her because it was the first time that she had a normal <em>class</em> that put on a performance and not just a competition or school-wide concert. And her mom was excited about it.\u00a0She (the student) went to a city nearly two hours away on the weekend to borrow a hanbok from her cousin. The other girl\u00a0<em>bought</em> a hanbok. And the girl who had worked so hard by her own meritable initiative, well, she worked so hard. And of course, there were other students who were so upset because they had expected their parents to attend and now they would have to go home and tell their mom and dad not to go to the school.</p>\n<p>It was one of the worst moments I&#8217;ve faced in the front of the classroom. The students were so distraught that we didn&#8217;t get anything accomplished, and I went to get Teacher Heather so they could have a Korean to talk to in their native language. I felt terrible. I apologized to them in case I really had forgotten to tell them, but they said it wasn&#8217;t my fault, as they cried their way out the classroom. I didn&#8217;t feel any better.</p>\n<p>But when I saw them in the hallway later that day, one of the girls said her teacher was planning to film the plays and post them online for the parents to see, so now everyone was happy again. (Praise the LORD that most children know how to bounce back from disappointment!) Then the students made me a little bit upset by apologizing to me. &#8220;What for?&#8221; I asked them. &#8220;For crying in your class.&#8221; Sigh.</p>\n<p>So today we had the performances. My low level first grade class sang &#8220;<a title=\"Peace Like a River\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2R4D6qhaD8\" target=\"_blank\">Peace Like a River</a>&#8220;(not the same version my students sang because I can&#8217;t find that one)\u00a0and &#8220;<a title=\"Bingo (Super Simple Songs)\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mmF8zOlh_g\" target=\"_blank\">Bingo</a>&#8221; (yes that version) very cutely. My high level third grade class performed &#8220;<a title=\"Little Half Chicken\" href=\"http://www.kidsinco.com/2009/06/little-half-chicken/\" target=\"_blank\">Little Half Chicken</a>&#8221; pretty well. My high level fourth grade wore their hanbok, had lots of props they made themselves (I&#8217;m not really that great of a director), and they did an\u00a0<em>excellent</em> job performing &#8220;<a title=\"Mount Semsi\" href=\"http://www.kidsinco.com/2009/02/mount-simeli/\" target=\"_blank\">Mount Semsi</a>.&#8221; I was proud of them and still am.</p>\n<p>Some other classes did well, too, and some read their lines straight from their scripts. That included a majority of the sixth grade students. When the sixth grade finished, our principal went to the stage and told them that they didn&#8217;t take this day seriously. Some of the third, fourth, and fifth grade classes had memorized all their parts, but most of the sixth grade students hadn&#8217;t. So she couldn&#8217;t praise them for a job well done, she said. And I was really glad she said that. Not because I want the children to feel bad, but it was good for her to be honest with them so that they will know in the future what&#8217;s expected of them, and they&#8217;ll know that the principal&#8217;s praises are always genuine.</p>\n<p>Anyway, we&#8217;re all glad that Drama Day is over. It was pretty stressful. I can&#8217;t even imagine how the kids felt yesterday.</p>\n<p>One more thing. The following is a complete change in topic. It could go in another post but then it&#8217;d probably never show up. Yesterday I went to a blueberry field and picked a bunch of blueberries. It was a ton of fun. By the end of it, the stress from the terrible time teaching was gone.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_4044\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/2014-06-26-18-12-57.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-4044\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/2014-06-26-18-12-57.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" alt=\"Picking blueberries.

Also by Teacher Heather.</p></div>\n<p>I went with our vice-principal, Teacher Heather, and a couple of other people I didn&#8217;t know. Ashley didn&#8217;t want to go. Mr. Mun (pronounced &#8220;Moon&#8221;; the vice-principal) decided to speak Korean with me instead of English, so it was a little difficult, but I was surprised by how much I could understand him. Usually when he switches to Korean to make us practice, it&#8217;s too difficult. He said I learn Korean well because of my beard. He said in the Bible, Samson had long hair and a long beard, and God made him strong. I was glad he said that because I&#8217;ve been letting my beard grow (I bet you wouldn&#8217;t find such a thing in an American elementary school) and I&#8217;ve wondered what the school administrators think of it. Aside from the occasional student who isn&#8217;t used to seeing facial hair on men, no one has asked for me to shave or trim it, though (and I keep it clean and tidy), so I didn&#8217;t worry that much.\u00a0But now I have a sort of indirect approval!</p>\n<p>In the car before we went to the field, the vice-principal gave me a piece of \ub5a1 (&#8220;ddeok&#8221;; Korean rice cake). But then he said, &#8220;But don&#8217;t eat it now. Don&#8217;t be a fool like me, who ate a piece. You have to have room for the blueberries.&#8221; When we got to the blueberry farm, Mr. Mun told me that for every ten blueberries I pick (to put in the basket for purchase) I should eat one. Then he said, &#8220;But I&#8217;m going to eat ten blueberries for every one that I pick.&#8221; I felt really good because I understand all of that in Korean (not every word, but I was confident of the content).</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t really know how many blueberries I picked or ate, but both were &#8220;a lot.&#8221; I planned to buy one kilogram of blueberries, but I don&#8217;t really have good skills at estimating how much things weight. And it was too much fun. I ended up having two and a half kilograms in my basket. Oh well. Now we have a lot of blueberries in our freezer for our smoothies!</p>\n<p>__________</p>\n<p>* (and, I hope, last, at least if the preparation for it doesn&#8217;t change)</p>\n<p>** Korean grammar includes a marker for plural nouns, but it&#8217;s usually optional, and the word &#8220;hanboks&#8221; sounds very strange to me,\u00a0so I&#8217;m leaving it as a strictly Korean word, lack of plural form and all. (\ud55c\ubcf5\ub4e4 is the plural form, but hanbokdeul wouldn&#8217;t make any sense to most readers, now, would it?)</p>\n", "post_id": 3941, "location": false, "date": "06-27-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>Oh, boy, did we have an exciting summer vacation. We had so greatly looked forward to it in the hectic and stressful weeks that led up to the end of the semester, and we were not disappointed. We spent some time in Michigan with my family and making the rounds to see various people.</p>\n<p>But before that, we had to get into the country. That was an interesting set of minor scenarios. The visas in our passports are expired (being for just the first year of our stay in the country), so every time we travel to or out of Korea on round-trip tickets, we also show our Alien Registration Cards to the attendants so they know that we are indeed qualified to re-enter the country. The ARCs have the updated dates of our permitted stay written in with permanent marker and taped over to prevent smearing. The attendant who checked us into our flight out of Korea saw Ashley&#8217;s card and exit date, which checked out. Then she looked at mine.</p>\n<p>Uh-oh. The most recent date on mine was not April of next year, but April of this year. Yes, as in three months before the events of this story. But after five or six seconds of panic, I looked and saw that it was clearly a clerical error, as the previous date box also listed an exit date in April 2014. So the attendant called immigration and confirmed that my card should have read 2015. Phew.</p>\n<p>Fast forward to going through customs and immigration on the American side of things. Remember how I <a title=\"Drama Day is Full of Drama\" href=\"http://129degreeseast.wordpress.com/2014/06/28/drama-day-is-full-of-drama/\" target=\"_blank\">picked blueberries</a> about a month before the start of my vacation? On my immigration card, I checked that I had visited a farm. Well, hey, it was a blueberry farm. In context, the question\u00a0seems to be worried about livestock and whatnot, but it asked if I visited a farm and I did. So I checked Yes. Well, that made the immigration officers ask me a few extra questions. I explained what kind of farm I visited and how long ago. Since you only need one card per family, Ashley was also interrogated. She just pointed to me and said, &#8220;He went to the blueberry farm. I didn&#8217;t.&#8221; But then we had one more step, and another man, at the very end of the customs process, asked me if I had brought soil back with me from the farm. I told him no, that in fact it had rained so hard a few days ago my shoes were soaked through and I&#8217;d washed them.</p>\n<p>So that was the hardest it&#8217;s been for me to return to my country, but it still wasn&#8217;t that bad. Actually, that was the quickest we&#8217;ve ever been through the customs and immigration process. I think they&#8217;ve streamlined it. Also, there are more self-process kiosks to speed up all of the preliminary procedures.</p>\n<p>Well, anyway, we got out of the airport, where my parents were just in time to pick us up and take us home. The rest of the week was great. First we went to the DMV to get Ashley a Michigan drivers&#8217; license and to renew mine, but after that, it was no work and all play. We went with our nieces to Michigan&#8217;s Adventure, an amusement and water park. We also went last year, I may have mentioned, but this year we stayed with our nieces for most of the time. They&#8217;re tall enough to go on quite a few rides, so we went on several rides with them. The lines were great, too, so that sometimes, our eldest niece told the ride operator, &#8220;We&#8217;re going to stay on and go again.&#8221; And because there was no one waiting, that was okay! Our nieces had a great time and, so did we.</p>\n<p>We also went camping. Not in-tents camping, but we went&#8211;Mom, Dad, our nieces, Ashley, and I&#8211;to a state park campground just beyond the border in Indiana in my parents&#8217; camping trailer. So what if we weren&#8217;t &#8220;roughin&#8217; it&#8221;? We spent some quality time outdoors, eating fire-cooked food, riding bikes, going on paddle boat rides, and enjoying the outdoors with family. That was probably the most relaxing part of my vacation.</p>\n<p>We saw lots of my extended families as well. My aunt and uncle in Texas timed their visit well, so we got to see them for a few days before we carried on over to California. We had a few family gatherings\u00a0here and there. In one of them, I played tag with all the children, including some of the children of my cousins, whom I barely knew before, so that was good.</p>\n<p>Who else did we see? We saw our friend Serenity, and that was lucky. We sent out a message to our friends in town and she replied immediately, saying she was about to leave to go to the airport to visit her father for a week, coming back the night before we would be leaving. We had about an hour to visit her, so we quickly did. A couple of our other friends had a baby while we were gone, so we got to meet her for the first time. Also, Justin makes some pretty darn good kimchi, I&#8217;d say!</p>\n<p>Our friend Tony wanted to see us, so we went to a Japanese restaurant with him with his girlfriend and had a good time. One the way back into town, he mentioned in passing that a particular apartment complex, which we were passing, was where his brother lived. His brother, Andr\u00e9, is another good friend of ours, and one we hadn&#8217;t had the chance to see in a few years. So we called him and arranged to see him before we left. That was fortunate. I think it may have been the first time we&#8217;ve seen him since we moved to Korea. He was the same hilarious, friendly, autumn-loving Andr\u00e9 we know and love.</p>\n<p>We visited the English Department at the university we attended together to say hello to some of our beloved professors. We actually had to make two trips there because our timing wasn&#8217;t so great the first time around. We talked to one professor and then no one else was around. So we returned the following day and spoke with a few more. It was great to see them all and hear their encouragement for us. I really appreciated learning from them, and I continue to appreciate them because they really care about their students, past, present, and future. We haven&#8217;t attended their classes in over four years, and I imagine I could add another four or more years onto that and still they would know us just as well as the students who visit them three times a week for classes. I guess that&#8217;s one of the perks of attending a smallish school.</p>\n<p>Oh, and I nearly forgot. My high school&#8217;s ten-year reunion happened to take place while we were in town, so we went to that. Not a lot of people showed up, but it wasn&#8217;t bad. I was actually worried I&#8217;d forget a lot of my classmates&#8217; names, but it didn&#8217;t turn out to be a big problem. One guy was talking to us and I couldn&#8217;t remember who he was until someone else came up to him and greeted him by name. &#8220;Oh yeah!&#8221; I thought. I didn&#8217;t feel too bad, though, because we&#8217;d actually been having a pretty genuine conversation (I was surprised by my social skills in that instant), and I didn&#8217;t know him all that well back then. But I got to catch up with a few friends whose names I did remember, so that was awesome, too.</p>\n<p>Anyway, eventually, we had to leave. I felt bad. The night before we left, our nieces said goodbye to us and gave us hugs. Hayden, the middle one, said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want you to leave!&#8221; over and over again, but she wasn&#8217;t too shook up about it. The youngest one, Abby, just said goodnight to us and gave us a hug. She was just a baby when we moved away, so this year was probably the first year she&#8217;s really known and liked us. Our eldest niece, however, was several years old when we left, and she understands more of what&#8217;s going on. She broke down in tears while she hugged me, and didn&#8217;t let me go for probably a good eight to ten minutes. I felt bad.</p>\n<p>And then we got to visit Ashley&#8217;s family in California for a week. That was great, although it was not at all what we expected. We expected to go to her grandparents, where her aunt, uncle, and two youngest cousins live, and also visit her sister and best friend, doing low-key things. Well, the day before we flew to California, Ashley&#8217;s aunt informed her that we&#8217;d better keep our schedule clear for the day after our arrival. Ashley&#8217;s grandparents, aunt, and uncle bought us park hopper passes for\u00a0Disneyland and California Adventure (so we could visit both theme parks), and they reserved us a room at the Disneyland Hotel (so we could enjoy Disneyland until it closed at midnight and get some rest afterward)! It was such a delightful gift. Unfortunately, we only saw Ashley&#8217;s aunt, uncle, and one of the two cousins for a few hours (they left the next day on their own trip, which was already planned before we announced our upcoming visit). Then it was time to sleep so we could wake up and get an early start for the fun-filled day awaiting us. Ashley&#8217;s aunt and cousin enthusiastically drew up a plan for us so we could efficiently enjoy the best parts of the parks, and it really did help. We went on thirteen rides (four within the first hour and a half), saw three and a half shows (we went to the wrong one and walked out before it was over; it was for little children), and enjoyed a few other attractions as well (such as the Innoventions building, which featured all kinds of cool, futuristic stuff, and also had on display some of the suits from the\u00a0<em>Iron Man</em>\u00a0movies).</p>\n<p>It was great to see Ashley&#8217;s family. It had been two years, I believe, since we&#8217;d last seen her maternal grandparents. They don&#8217;t go out much these daysbut we\u00a0all went out together one day for a drive to see various places in the area. It was Monday, so a lot of stuff we closed (apparently), but it was nice to drive around and hear their stories about these places. If they weren&#8217;t going out with us, they were sending us out. Especially Ashley&#8217;s grandfather, who knows his stuff when it comes to good food. His active involvement in the restaurant business gave him great insights in where to suggest we eat. I&#8217;ll tell you what: I&#8217;ve never had soup as good as that of a place, located just a\u00a0hop away (not even a skip)\u00a0from Ashley&#8217;s grandparents&#8217; house, called <a title=\"Little Flower Candy Co.\" href=\"http://littleflowercandyco.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Little Flower Candy Company</a>. We ordered extra food to take home, and we went a second time before we left. If you&#8217;re ever in Pasadena, I strongly recommend you try Little Flower if you&#8217;re in the mood for soup. Their salads and sandwiches are good, too, but their soup will soothe the broken heart of a stomach that didn&#8217;t know why it was broken. (The answer, of course, is that it had never enjoyed Little Flower&#8217;s soup.)</p>\n<p>Anyway, I&#8217;m trying to be brief. I&#8217;ve gone on for nearly 1900 words and I&#8217;ve yet a few more. We saw Ashley&#8217;s younger sister, too, when we went to her local church. We also caught up with the pastor who officiated at our wedding. That evening, we went to an expensive movie theater (I think all movie theaters are expensive, as I grew up near a theater where the most expensive tickets cost $5, and I normally pay $8 or $9 in Korea) to see\u00a0<em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>. I&#8217;ll tell you something else: That&#8217;s my favorite Marvel movie. I don&#8217;t care how much action\u00a0<em>The Avengers</em> has.\u00a0<em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> has some of the best film characterization of super heroes I&#8217;ve seen (although I can&#8217;t discredit the other movies on this; it&#8217;s just that I especially loved the characters in\u00a0<em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>).</p>\n<p>I digress again. The next day, we went with Ashley&#8217;s sister to see Ashley&#8217;s friend Janelle at Manhattan Beach. Ashley&#8217;s godson (Janelle&#8217;s son) was there, too. Parking at Manhattan Beach is no joke. I wish it were, but it wasn&#8217;t. We spent a great number of minutes searching for a lot with a space, but when we finally found one, a hidden little strip of cars about half a mile from the beach, there were no meters! The sign said FREE ALL DAY PUBLIC PARKING. I entered that one-line parking lot hopeful but\u00a0without true expectation, and after passing a couple dozen vehicles, there it was: a parking spot with my rental car&#8217;s name on it. (Here&#8217;s an interesting story. Later, when Janelle had to move her car from the two-hour spot she&#8217;d found, we tried to see if there would be something in the free lot where we&#8217;d parked. While everyone doubted a space would be available, I confidently said, &#8220;There&#8217;s one spot open, and it&#8217;s the spot three spots to the right of where I parked!&#8221; We got into Janelle&#8217;s car and drove to that lot. We passed the rental car. I counted one. I counted two. And did I count three? No, because that spot was\u00a0<em>empty</em>! Okay, maybe I\u00a0wasn&#8217;t so confident in my prediction, but it was still fun to pretend that I&#8217;d foreseen it.)</p>\n<p>Well, anyway, our vacation came to a close. We got on a plane in Los Angeles, had a layover in Tokyo, had more layover in Tokyo as our plane was delayed in order to remove the luggage of no-show passengers and then to reclaim a spot in the takeoff line, and finally arrived at Incheon International Airport.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_4049\" style=\"width: 177px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/1623629_10204508521295821_8432076461331375336_n.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-4049\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/1623629_10204508521295821_8432076461331375336_n.jpg?w=167&#038;h=300\" alt=\"At the mall with my family on our last day in Michigan.\"   /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">At the mall with my family on our last day in Michigan.</p></div><div id=\"attachment_4050\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/10271541_633714389977_5095246858571027328_n.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-4050\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/10271541_633714389977_5095246858571027328_n.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" alt=\"Ashley poses with some of the Iron Man suits.

Actually, I didn&#8217;t have any jet leg. It was amazing. Because of the delay for the final leg of our flight back to Korea, I felt good and tired when we arrived at the airport hotel around eleven Thursday night. I went to sleep and woke up around seven or eight in the morning, so I was set.</p>\n<p>We worked that week of the 11th, but only for four days. We had what is known in Korea as &#8220;summer camp.&#8221; For us, it means teaching a handful of students for four hours and then going home after lunch. August 15 is a national holiday, which means that for most years we only teach four days of this week. This year, August 15 was Friday. When we finished work on Thursday, we boarded the Saemaul train to Cheonan and then the ITX-Saemaul train to Busan.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;d made plans to meet some of our friends we&#8217;d met when we lived there in 2011/early 2012, and the time and cost of going to Busan compared to other cities in Korea means we prefer to go when we have 3- or 4-day weekends.</p>\n<p>Well, we went, and I think we had a pretty good time. I was a bit late in purchasing tickets, however, so the KTX tickets were sold out for the time we wanted. I had to book the slower ITX-Saemaul train instead. We also had to leave at 10 in the morning on Sunday. It was alright, though. Getting back in the early afternoon meant we had several hours to rest and relax before starting the second semester of the school year on Monday.</p>\n<p>For a while, we just enjoyed our time away from our place in Korea. Sound strange after only being back in the country for a week? Maybe, but it doesn&#8217;t change that we spend nearly every day while in Korea in small-town Gwangcheon. Also, it had been a long time since we&#8217;d been in Busan. We enjoyed a nice Korean BBQ meal Thursday night and went to a buffet for lunch on Friday. The name of that buffet is Ashley. We also decided to catch a movie, one we&#8217;d never even heard of:\u00a0<em>Begin Again</em>. We really liked it. The movie was character-driven and basically a feel-good flick about musicians.</p>\n<p>On Saturday we met our friends, Brian and Kathleen, at Songdo Beach. Although we lived in Busan for a year, we didn&#8217;t visit all the beaches. Songdo is closer to where Brian and Kathleen live, while we usually went to Gwangalli Beach. Actually, Songdo Beach is nice. But the greatest part was seeing our friends. We all brought various things to eat and we had a picnic on the beach until we were sun-tired and ready for supper. We went to an American-style diner and the food was pretty good, although Brian and I both were disappointed by the size of the burger patties (if the bun had been the same size instead of twice the diameter, maybe it wouldn&#8217;t have been a big deal).</p>\n<p>So it wasn&#8217;t much. We just had a picnic and dinner with our friends, but it was great to be on this mini-vacation. I don&#8217;t remember the last time we saw Brian and Kathleen, but I think it was a year ago or even more. The problem is that going to Busan takes more time and money than going to Seoul or Cheonan. Going for just a day or two doesn&#8217;t usually feel worth the effort. But it&#8217;s nice to go there once in a while, and I&#8217;m glad we did.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n", "post_id": 4060, "location": false, "date": "08-24-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/dmB1u-kvd1k?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span>\n", "post_id": 418, "location": false, "date": "05-08-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>(by Brian)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em>Will Smith goes to a Korean restaurant with some friends.

Although kimchi is sometimes sour and overpowering to people who have not tried it many times, kimchi jjigae has a completely different flavor.

I never tried that recipe, but now, after almost three months in Korea, I have made kimchi jjigae. Ever since we got the rice cooker, I have been buying ingredients to make Korean meals. Until then, we normally ate stir fry, ordered chicken, cooked some ramen (although now we call it ramyeon), or went to a restaurant. But now we not only have a rice cooker, but I have also learned some things about Korean food and Korean ingredients that I didn&#8217;t know before.</p>\n<p>So over the weekend I tried to make a few simple things. I made a simple seaweed soup a couple of times, and I also made a variation of kimchi fried rice. It&#8217;s great that there are so many ways to make some of these dishes, because it helped me to relax while making the kimchi jjigae. Some people use onions? Some add fish paste? You can put mushrooms in it? I saw lots of different recipes, so when I decided to make it myself, I knew that I could do pretty much whatever I wanted as long as the key ingredients were there and as long as I made them into a stew.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img title=\"Source: americansweets.co.uk\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.americansweets.co.uk/ekmps/shops/statesidecandy/images/kraft-american-miracle-whip-dressing-15oz-443ml-jar-952-p.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">And as long as certain ingredients were left out.</p></div>\n<p>And here is how I chose to make it. First, I cup up some vegetables to put in all at once at a certain point (there&#8217;s limited space in the kitchen, so I have to give a bit more concentration toward ingredient preparation).</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_421\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/img_2494.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-421\" title=\"IMG_2494\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/img_2494.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Bowl contents: a few cloves of fresh minced garlic, a small bit of freshly shaved ginger, some green onions, a bit of mushrooms, gochujang (pepper paste), gochugaru (pepper powder), sliced gochu (hot pepper).</p></div>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I also prepared the kimchi. On the right is kimchi, and on the left is a small bowl of some of the juice from the bag of kimchi.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_422\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/img_2495.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-422\" title=\"IMG_2495\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/img_2495.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Next time, I think I will take more juice. I was worried that I would take all of it and leave none for the leftover kimchi, but Wednesday&#039;s jjigae could have used some more of it, I think. And there was plenty remaining.</p></div>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I had a thick coating of sesame oil on the bottom of the pan warmed up before I added a drained can of tuna and the kimchi. Sometimes, kimchi jjigae is made with pork. It can also be made with tuna, and then it&#8217;s called \ucc38\uce58\uae40\uce58\ucc0c\uac1c (with the added chamchi, or &#8220;tuna,&#8221; at the beginning, as it appears at the top of this post). Of course, it&#8217;s possible to make it without meat at all if you wish. Or, if you don&#8217;t like tuna and have objections to swine flesh, I don&#8217;t see any reason against substituting with beef. It should match the stew quite well, actually.<a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/img_2498.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-423\" title=\"IMG_2498\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/img_2498.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">A bit later, of course, I added the bowl of additional ingredients.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_425\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/img_2500.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-425\" title=\"IMG_2500\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/img_2500.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Is anyone else starting to feel a bit hungry?</p></div>\n<p>Then I filled the pot with just enough water to cover the food, added some tofu cubes, and let the stew simmer for a good 30 minutes. If you don&#8217;t like tofu, you can leave it out. Or if you want a vegetarian meal, you can add more tofu to replace the meat (although why you would want to do anything like that is beyond me).</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_426\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/img_2502.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-426\" title=\"IMG_2502\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/img_2502.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Alright, now I&#039;m starting to regret not writing this post while I still had some jjigae leftover.</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_427\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/img_2505.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-427\" title=\"IMG_2505\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/img_2505.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">It&#039;s quite tasty to dip a spoonful of rice into the stew before eating it. Actually, at restaurants in Korea, they prepare this dish in stone bowls that keep the soup sizzling hot for a long time. I kind of HAVE to use rice to cool it down!</p></div>\n<p>A really good kimchi jjigae is spicy, of course, with all of the pepper-based ingredients that go into it (although some people only use one or two, depending on the desired consistency of the broth and whatnot). It&#8217;s also savory and soul-warming. I can&#8217;t really describe it very well, because I need to work on expanding my taste-description skills. This kimchi jjigae that I made sure was spicy, and it was savory, but it was missing something in the soul-satisfying department. It was delicious, and Ashley loved it, but I think I made it too thin. (I later read that gochujang, the paste, thickens it, while gochugaru, the powder, thins it. I did kind of add a lot of the gochugaru.)</p>\n<p>But I&#8217;ve at least nine more months in this country. I will figure it out.</p>\n", "post_id": 420, "location": false, "date": "05-12-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>My time in Korea has its ups and downs.

It&#8217;s not just the availability of transport itself, but the personalities of the bus passengers, and the personalities of the bus and taxi drivers that improve the day. Last week, I was touched when an elderly woman who was getting off the bus told me to take her seat (in Korean that I didn&#8217;t understand and gestures that I did understand). Another ajumma helped me extricate my sweater from the chair handle, so that I could get off the bus safely rather than rip my sweater.

At the bus stop there is a sign with a list of the busses that stop there, and a list of locations that they have stopped, \u00a0and where they will stop (the previous locations are greyed out). Then you wait for the bus with the appropriate bus number.

They wear special gloves and sometimes greet you when you get on the bus. They are always honking at cars and other buses, \u00a0and they all seem to enjoy listening to the radio. \u00a0A lot of the bus drivers like to listen to Korean oldies that have a very distinct sound. In fact, I would say that bus drivers listening to that kind of music is a Korean stereotype. When one of my co-teachers asked if I&#8217;d heard the type of music that was playing on the speakers at the park, I said &#8220;Yes, on the bus.&#8221; And she laughed and nodded her head as if I had made a joke. Some bus drivers break the mold, however, by listening to American music. I once heard country music while riding the bus here in Busan. Another time, a young bus driver in dark sunglasses bobbed his head to some American hip hop.</p>\n<p>Apart from the music, the bus ride is like a rollercoaster. If you don&#8217;t have a seat, hold on for your life! The steep slopes and sharp turns are jolting. I&#8217;m often worried when I see Brian wobbling as if he&#8217;s about to topple over.

It means &#8220;Today is our wedding anniversary.&#8221; One year ago today, Ashley and I made our commitment to each other legal by the power vested in a court magistrate by the State of Michigan. And today we decided to celebrate in a very proper way, I think.</p>\n<p>The way our engagement started, which seems now so long ago, was Ashley and I went with our school to see a Shakespeare play. It was the bloody tragedy <em>Macbeth</em>, and before it was showtime, I asked Ashley to marry me. We sat through the play and on the bus ride home without revealing to anyone what we had just done. It was, for the night, our secret.</p>\n<p>Today, to celebrate our anniversary, we saw another Shakespeare play. Yes, there is a production of Shakespeare going on in Busan, South Korea. But of course this was not the first thing we did today. No, earlier today was Sabbath. Ashley and I got our rest. We ate some cold noodles (\ube44\ube54\ub0c9\uba74, or bibim naengmyeon, which are pretty good), sat around in our apartment, and read stuff on the Internet and in our Bibles about the end of the world and Bible prophecy. It&#8217;s a very daunting task, and I don&#8217;t imagine I&#8217;ll ever be done. Until I&#8217;m dead. But that&#8217;s not the point.</p>\n<p>The point is that later in the afternoon, Ashley and I got dressed and ready and we went to the other side of the city, to Haeundae Beach. We left early to get good seats for this evening event. From the beach we walked, according to some directions on the Facebook page that invited us to see the production, for probably 30 minutes or more. But the view was incredible. We walked along a tree-lined sidewalk and eventually came to a clearing where we could see the beach and the city in the same view, because we were beyond the beach, toward the end of the bay. But I couldn&#8217;t get a good picture with my camera. Sorry. Maybe we&#8217;ll go another time, at a different time of day or with different weather.</p>\n<p>Eventually we arrived at the Dalmaji Amphitheater, which looks like this:</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_464\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/img_2532.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-464\" title=\"IMG_2532\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/img_2532.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">As you can see, we didn&#039;t need to be worried about seats.</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_460\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/img_2527.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-460\" title=\"IMG_2527\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/img_2527.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">It's a very beautiful place.</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_462\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/img_2530.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-462\" title=\"IMG_2530\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/img_2530.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ashley thought the place was pretty, too.</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_461\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/img_2529.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-461\" title=\"IMG_2529\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/img_2529.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">So...they make a good match.</p></div>\n<p>Later the play started. It seemed that several English teachers, like ourselves, formed an amateur acting club of sorts. I think there were also non-teachers in the group, because a few of the actors seemed older than the preferred age range for Guest English Teachers. And I also don&#8217;t want to assume that every young foreigner in Korea is a teacher. The director of the play, who also appeared as a couple of minor characters, told us that this was the second production so far and that they hoped for two more this year. And we hope, of course, to go.</p>\n<p>The play that the club performed was the comedy <em>As You Like It</em>, and we enjoyed it. Some of the actors were pretty good. Some of them, however ([cough] the director [cough]), had troubles projecting their voices. We missed a few words here and there, but everyone with a major role had few volume errors. I kept wondering, sometimes, if the people toward the back could hear. We sat near the front.</p>\n<p>I think the volume of some actors was the only detriment to the play. I genuinely enjoyed watching the performance, and the only reason I wanted it to end was because the weather turned cool and windy. The production was even customized to fit the audience, which was mostly expats but also, surprisingly, included some Koreans. I think learning today&#8217;s English is hard enough for Koreans, but to follow the fast-paced, pun-filled speech of Shakespeare characters, or even to try, is impressive.</p>\n<p>One character in the play, a wrestler named Charles, arrived on stage followed by fans who cheered him on by saying, &#8220;Charles-eu! Charles-eu!&#8221; Many Korean words end in a sound that is similar to uh, except more forward in the mouth. Especially words that are borrowed from English. So everyone got a good laugh out of this adaptation of speech. During a fight between Charles and the main character of the story, some other characters yelled, &#8220;Fighting!&#8221; which is, in Korea, similar to saying, &#8220;Good luck,&#8221; or &#8220;I&#8217;m rooting for you!&#8221; or &#8220;Go Bears!&#8221; It&#8217;s a cheer. Another good laugh. And finally, later in the play a character said that something was &#8220;so-so,&#8221; and the actors emphasized their reaction to this word. It was funny because many Korean students say &#8220;so-so,&#8221; and some English teachers try to get them to say words that are more common, like &#8220;Okay.&#8221;</p>\n<p>After the play was over, Ashley and I looked for a place to eat. We almost went into a Vietnamese restaurant near the amphitheater, but we quickly discovered it was a reservations-only place. So it&#8217;s probably a good thing that we didn&#8217;t go there. We walked back toward the city and found an Italian bistro called Il Massimo, &#8220;Since 2011.&#8221; The food was very good, if not a bit pricey, since Italian pasta isn&#8217;t as cheap in Korea as it is in the United States. But I was very impressed.</p>\n<p>Finally, we went back home. Our stop on the 17 bus is up the hill from our apartment on the opposite side of the group of apartments, about three or four minutes from our apartment by foot. Right at the stop is a small collection of shops. One of them is a Tous Les Jours, which is a popular bakery chain (Paris Baguette is the other one, and both chains are seriously everywhere in Korea, although there are also a few smaller chains or one-ofs). They sell all kinds of wonderful baked treats, including small, beautiful cakes.</p>\n<p>Ashley and I decided a while ago that we would not be able to eat our wedding cake&#8217;s top layer on our anniversary. And that&#8217;s okay. It&#8217;s a tradition we can live without. The cost of having Ashley&#8217;s mom send us the cake, doubled with the uncertainty of its safe, customs-processed arrival, influenced us to simply let Ashley&#8217;s mom and siblings enjoy the cake. On our anniversary, of course. So we decided that for our anniversary we would buy one of the cakes that we often see in Korea, which look so nice everywhere we go. Here is our cake:</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_465\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/img_2534.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-465\" title=\"IMG_2534\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/img_2534.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Yes.

Yes.</p>\n", "post_id": 458, "location": false, "date": "05-28-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>(by Brian)</p>\n<p>Our second trip to Seoul (\uc11c\uc6b8) was just as eventful as the first, but without all the wandering around, helplessly lost bits.</p>\n<p>There were only<em> some</em> of the helplessly lost bits.<em></em></p>\n<p>Ashley and I took advantage of the Korean holiday on Monday (Korean Memorial Day) and spent three days and two nights in Seoul this time, a full day longer than our last trip, when we met Kristina in Seoul to see Cirque du Soleil. This time there was no Kristina to meet. She has been on the North American continent for more than a month by now. No, we didn&#8217;t see Kristina or any other college-days peers.</p>\n<p>We saw our professors. Specifically, we met Dr. Closser and Dr. Greig, who are currently in Seoul to teach a couple of short English courses. We had talked often of visiting whenever they came to this side of the world, and the three-day weekend presented us with a great excuse to fulfill those intentions. And our professors graciously offered to let us use one of the spare rooms in their campus apartment, which meant that there would be no monetary guilt in staying the extra day.</p>\n<p>On Saturday morning, we left our apartment. We packed our bags, turned off the heat (which was already on its lowest setting ever since winter ended), and caught the bus to Busan Station. We took the Mugunghwa (\ubb34\uad81\ud654) train to Seoul this time. Last time, we took the KTX both ways because we took two trips in two days. A special foreigners&#8217; rail pass allowed us a discount, but it&#8217;s based on time. A three-day pass with two train trips would be a waste of money. So we decided to take a leisurely ride to Seoul on the slowest train and, after a weekend of who knows what (we really didn&#8217;t know what), to take the fast train back home. After all, we <em>would</em> have to teach the following day.</p>\n<p>And we sure were glad we took the slow train on the way to the country&#8217;s capital. Yes, it took nearly three hours longer (more than five hours), but the scenery was wonderful. The scenery on the KTX isn&#8217;t bad, but that train travels through tunnels as often as it shows its passengers the Korean countryside. The Mugunghwa brought us between forest-covered mountains and shimmering rice fields that I would love to visit someday on foot. Ashley remarked to Dr. Closser and Dr. Greig that whenever she would awake from a doze, she would see lovely sights from her window.</p>\n<p>Sorry. I didn&#8217;t take pictures. They wouldn&#8217;t have turned out anyway.</p>\n<p>Finally, we arrived at Seoul Station, about 10 or 15 minutes later than our tickets had promised. We took a rest at the station for a bit and then picked up our return ticket. I had it reserved already, but I didn&#8217;t know what Monday would bring. I would hate to get to the station with 10 or 15 minutes until departure and have just as long a line to get my ticket.</p>\n<p>With our tickets retrieved, we followed Dr. Closser&#8217;s instructions for finding the apartment. Ten stops on the Seoul metro and a few city blocks later, we found the place. Okay. There was some confusion involved, but only on my part, I admit. Ashley wasn&#8217;t too engrossed in the words of Dr. Closser&#8217;s directions to forget to apply them to the real world.</p>\n<p>We rang the doorbell. Dr. Closser&#8217;s directions said we could stay at the apartment if we recognized the tune. I was afraid of this moment. There are many tunes I cannot name. I relied on Ashley&#8217;s musical family background to save us. She guessed, &#8220;Beautiful Dreamer?&#8221; She wasn&#8217;t sure if it was the name or just a part of the lyrics. Fortunately, it was the title, and our former professors allowed us into their month-long home.</p>\n<p>Okay, they opened the door before our answer, but I had to make it dramatic.</p>\n<p>I have to say that I was very impressed by the apartment. Most apartments are kind of small. I think the single apartment alone could be classified as a house. There was a spacious kitchen, dining area, living room, and four bedrooms upstairs. There were also, of course, more beds downstairs, because at times the place fills up completely, when there are teachers/missionaries being trained and whatnot.</p>\n<p>But this weekend, we had the place to ourselves. And it was nice. I had wondered how it would feel to see our professors after more than three months of being on the other side of the globe, and to see them on that other side, no less. I think it actually made us a bit nostalgic. Ashley remarked after we returned that she had forgotten how much she enjoyed listening to Dr. Greig discuss language theories. I didn&#8217;t say anything, but I agreed and had had similar thoughts.</p>\n<p>Oh. And yes, there was some brief and leisurely academic discussion going on. I guess it&#8217;s not really that hard to readjust to such roles in the right environment. Here is a thought I did have while we were still in Seoul: &#8220;Ah, the joys of free education.&#8221; I really appreciated the discussions that Dr. Greig, Dr. Closser, Ashley, and I shared this last weekend. Paid courses were wonderful. You probably know of my excitement for a few of them, and if I didn&#8217;t tell you directly, you probably figured it out when you heard me list my courses each semester. But there was something about talking about (or, rather, listening to) these subjects we had recently paid for and stressed over, now in a relaxed and free environment.</p>\n<p>And the environment was not only relaxed in that we weren&#8217;t expected to write anything or show up to class on time, but it was also relaxed in, um, well, I kind of mentioned it already. We weren&#8217;t expected to show up to class on time. Even on the weekends, I dislike waking up too late. I worried especially of losing time to see the city with our hosts, but I was mistaken. They took advantage of the weekend almost as much as we did.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I&#8217;m guessing that you want to see pictures by now. Okay. Here we go.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_480\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/img_2537.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-480\" title=\"IMG_2537\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/img_2537.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">This is outside the Seoul Tower.</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_481\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/img_2539.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-481\" title=\"IMG_2539\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/img_2539.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">This is also outside the Seoul Tower.

By the time we got to the ticket line (around 9:00), a kind Korean woman told us and the nearby customers that there would be a two-hour wait. That meant getting into the tower around eleven. That meant probably leaving the tower after the buses and subway trains stopped running. Although taxis are pretty cheap in Korea, we didn&#8217;t know how far away from the apartment we were. It was probably for the better anyway. The night got hazier and hazier. We wouldn&#8217;t have seen much.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_483\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/img_2547.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-483\" title=\"IMG_2547\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/img_2547.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">There are places like this around the world, where couples purchase two locks and lock them together on a bridge or railing.</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_484\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/img_2551.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-484\" title=\"IMG_2551\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/img_2551.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The locks were probably 6 to 8 inches deep in some spots, not fastened to each other and the railing any longer, but to each other and...another lock.

I&#039;m jealous of his camera. (Christmas hint, Christmas hint...haha, just kidding.)</p></div>\n<p>All of that took place on Saturday night. Dr. Greig was very busy this weekend, so she did not go with us. Maybe that was a good thing, because remember how I said we did get just a little bit lost? Well, this was that time. And I&#8217;m sure all the wandering around we did would not have been well for her knee.</p>\n<p>We took the metro and a bus to get here. The bus took us to the top of the hill, but we couldn&#8217;t figure out how to get on buses that went back down the hill. It was a one-way road. We had seen lots of people walking down the hill while on the bus, so we finally decided to follow suit. It was quite a long walk, but easy. At the bottom of the hill, we found out that our bus, number 2, did not have a stop nearby. The bus stop had bus 420 and another stop, and after a very nice young Korean man helped us out, we determined that bus 420 would take us to the subway station we wanted. We got on the 420 bus and examined the route line and determined further that there was another subway station, closer to our final destination, that we could go to at a certain stop.</p>\n<p>Well, you probably guessed that it wasn&#8217;t there. It was, but not <em>right</em> there in the way we expected from the location label having \uc5ed in the name (\uc5ed/yeok can mean &#8220;station&#8221; when it&#8217;s at the end of a place name). But finally, maybe 15 minutes later, we found a station. It didn&#8217;t matter which station by then. Any station could eventually lead to any other station.</p>\n<p>The next day, we went to a temple:</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_490\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/img_2610.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-490\" title=\"IMG_2610\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/img_2610.jpg?w=500&#038;h=280\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"280\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">At Changgyeonggung (\ucc3d\uacbd\uad81), a temple near Insadong (\uc778\uc0ac\ub3d9) in Seoul.</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_491\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/img_2621.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-491\" title=\"IMG_2621\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/img_2621.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ashley. &#039;Nuff said.</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_492\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/img_2626.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-492\" title=\"IMG_2626\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/img_2626.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">You can see Dr. Closser taking lots of pictures while Ashley has a more passive way of admiring the location.</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_493\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/img_2632.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-493\" title=\"IMG_2632\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/img_2632.jpg?w=500&#038;h=280\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"280\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Break time.

She took us to a place called Everest, an Indian restaurant that was owned by what appeared to be an Indian family. Sometimes you can get curry in Korea, but it&#8217;s often bland and not very spicy. But this curry was some of the best I&#8217;ve eaten ever. Meet me in Seoul and I&#8217;ll take you there.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t have any pictures from the restaurant. Dr. Closser had a member of the staff take a picture of the four of us, and maybe I&#8217;ll get the picture from him once his computer is working again. I should also say, don&#8217;t expect to see Dr. Greig in this blog. Because she could not join us very often, the only picture of her is that same one on Dr. Closser&#8217;s camera.</p>\n<p>The next day, we visited a free museum.

My practical job title? Rock star.</p>\n<p>Here is a typical day at the girls&#8217; high school where I work:</p>\n<p>I arrive somewhere between ten and thirty minutes before I need to, depending on what time I leave the house, what time the bus arrives, and what condition the traffic is in. I get off the bus and walk through the gate of the school, where three or four students and one teacher (a different batch each day) stand to greet everyone with a bow and an \uc548\ub155\ud558\uc138\uc694 (hello). For me, though, they usually wave and say Hi.</p>\n<p>I go to my office (which is now the English Caf\u00e9; I got moved from the main teachers&#8217; office to my own in the same classroom where I teach the 1st graders &#8211; the 2nd grade classes are too big for the English Caf\u00e9 though, so I teach them in their normal classrooms). I either work on finishing up a lesson plan if I need to or I relax to calm myself before starting the class.</p>\n<p>Then it&#8217;s time to teach. Each class is different, and the students in the classes are different, too. I have a few favorite classes, actually, where the students overall tend to either behave well in class or participate in my lessons. Heck, I have some classes where the students don&#8217;t really behave or pay attention to my lesson but they speak more English than other classes. And that&#8217;s pretty much my purpose here, to get students to speak English and thus practice their speaking and listening skills. Their reading skills are pretty good.</p>\n<p>In some of these classes, the students talk to me a lot. In nearly all of them, they are big fans, although I suspect some might hate me because their English skills are too poor to understand even my easiest of tasks (&#8220;Just read the blue words: &#8216;It cost five dollars'&#8221;). If I put a picture of myself on a PowerPoint presentation, they get excited. Especially if that picture looks different than how I look on a typical school day. In a lesson on English exaggeration phrases, for example, I included the following photo:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/sillybrian.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-530\" title=\"sillybrian\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/sillybrian.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a>The students, of course, got a kick out of this photo. Some of them complimented me on my &#8220;Photoshop&#8221; skills (even though I didn&#8217;t use Photoshop because Photoshop is <em>expensive</em>. I used GIMP, which is free). But I don&#8217;t think any picture has received such a strong reaction as this one:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/216701_502949054757_85600676_30062221_2495_n.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-531\" title=\"216701_502949054757_85600676_30062221_2495_n\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/216701_502949054757_85600676_30062221_2495_n.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a>I put this picture as one of the icons for a bomb game.

So this last week, I changed some of the pictures on the question-selection screen, and one of the pictures I added was this one. Many students were supremely shocked to see me with long hair and such a scruffy beard. Even my co-teachers were surprised, and one of them went closer to the TV screen to examine it to make sure.</p>\n<p>The best reaction, though, was when one team chose their question: &#8220;Jesus!&#8221; Everyone closer to the front, who could see my familiar facial features, started laughing.</p>\n<p>So sometimes the classes are fun and sometimes they are not. I guess that&#8217;s just how it goes. In the hallways, all of the students greet me. They kind of have to, as it is a sort of custom for students to bow to teachers in the hallway, but only some students bow to me. The others say &#8220;Hi, teacher!&#8221; or &#8220;Hi, Brian!&#8221; or &#8220;Hi, Mr. U!&#8221; and they wave. Sometimes they give me a snack. One student gave me an Oreo-like cookie, except it tasted even better than an Oreo. I&#8217;ve received a throat lozenge, a chocolate Cheeto-like treat, trail-mix-type snacks, a little pouch of homemade walnut cookies, and even a Capri Sun-like pouch of soy milk. It was good soy milk, too.</p>\n<p>After a few classes, it&#8217;s time for lunch. I eat lunch, and as I pass through the student side of the cafeteria to the teacher&#8217;s dining room, or from it, the students wave and say hi to me. Then I go back to my office, where students can come to talk to me during the remainder of the lunch period to practice speaking English. Sometimes I have as many as five or six girls who come to speak to me, but there are two girls who show up almost every day and sometimes they are the only ones who come to see me.</p>\n<p>And then lunch is over, and it&#8217;s either time to teach fifth period or not, depending on what day it is. When fifth period is over, it&#8217;s time to clean. Well, for the students, it is. Although I think they must have a rotation of sorts, because not every girl cleans every day. Anyway, when it&#8217;s time for them to clean, I go outside and walk around the building. Many students are out there, either taking out the trash or, for those who don&#8217;t have to clean that day, getting some fresh air or running around on the &#8220;playground&#8221; (which is mostly a big dirt field, although there are a few pieces of equipment off to the side).</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve learned very quickly about Korean students. When they&#8217;re in class, they are study machines. And they are in class <em>all day</em>. So whenever they are not in class, they take advantage of every moment. When I first started going outside, I noticed that many more students would come to talk to me. So I continued to do it, because I wanted them to practice English. I love my students and I want them to do well. I sometimes see third graders (12th graders, whom I don&#8217;t teach) who talk to me, however briefly. But I also noticed something else: students would be very excited to see me. It doesn&#8217;t happen all the time, but often students will shout &#8220;Hi, teacher!&#8221; or &#8220;Hi, Brian!&#8221; from the classroom windows. Most of the classrooms are on the 2nd floor or higher, so I always have to look up to see who is calling to me, and usually I see a whole group of girls smiling and waving at me.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve learned about myself in Korea, something I probably would have (and probably did) deny in America: Not only do I have an ego, but I like it. I know that I&#8217;m popular simply because I&#8217;m different (or, according to many of my students, handsome) or because I&#8217;m a &#8220;fun&#8221; teacher (even though my classes aren&#8217;t always fun, they aren&#8217;t the academic classes they have to endure throughout the rest of their school days). But it still feels good to have such attention. Maybe that&#8217;s a bad thing, but at the moment I do not care. Okay? Okay.</p>\n<p>Besides, it is attention like that that, I think, has allowed more students to become comfortable around me. I still have some students, on the other hand, who get shy to ask me a question or speak in front of me in class. Once, while walking around outside, a heard a few girls walking behind me. It sounded like they were merely walking in the same direction. Until I turned around. One of them started jumping and putting her hands to her face and shaking. Symptoms of nervousness. I guess she wanted to say hi but she was afraid. Every friendly word I spoke to her caused her to back away or blush. But a few minutes later she came back, nerves calmed and steadied, to say hi and to tell me that she was very shy.</p>\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t always like this. I used to have many many more shy students. When I first came, the girls, as a whole, were very excited. They cheered and screamed and everything when the principal introduced me to the student body. They shouted, in the safety of the crowd of voices in the classroom on the first days, &#8220;Cute!&#8221; and &#8220;Handsome!&#8221; and whatnot. And they were very excited. But individually, they were shy. They wouldn&#8217;t say anything. After \u00a0a few weeks, I think they were not very shy any longer, but I think they noticed that I was not a good teacher, or at least not a very confident one (which means not being a good teacher). Or maybe they simply lost their initial enthusiasm for having a foreign teacher. But I think over the last month or two, I have grown more comfortable. In Korea, in my job, around my students. And they notice those kinds of things. So I think they are, once again, excited to be around me.</p>\n<p>And then the cleaning period is over, and it&#8217;s time to go back inside and teach six period (unless it&#8217;s Tuesday, the only day I don&#8217;t teach sixth period but instead seventh period, the last period of the normal school day &#8211; I say normal because many students stay after for extra classes or self-study, and they are there long enough to eat supper at school!). Finally, my day is done, and it&#8217;s time to go home. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, one of my co-teachers who lives near to me takes me home (on the other days, she teaches eighth period, so she can&#8217;t). When I have to go home myself, I walk down the hill to the highway, where there is Naengjeong Subway Station (\ub0c9\uc815\uc5ed) and some bus stops. I can get on bus 6 and walk maybe seven to ten minutes uphill to get to my apartment (I haven&#8217;t really timed it), or bus 169 and walk maybe five to seven minutes downhill. I take whichever one comes first, usually.</p>\n<p>On Friday, after I got done playing badminton with some of my co-workers after school (more on that later, I think), I started walking down the hill to go home. Mr. Lee caught up with me, as he was heading down the hill at that time, too. We walked together, and after a few minutes a bus passed us by. I wasn&#8217;t paying attention to the bus at first, so Mr. Lee told me to look. I looked up and saw three or four girls poking their heads and arms out the bus window and saying, &#8220;Hi, teacher!&#8221; &#8220;Hi, Brian!&#8221; They saw Mr. Lee and said hi to him, too, but then continued to wave at me. This last bit well tell you just how much these girls can affect my ego. As the bus turned a corner (so that now I could see the girls better and they me), a couple of the girls said, &#8220;I love you!&#8221;</p>\n<p>And they blew me kisses.</p>\n", "post_id": 527, "location": false, "date": "06-19-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>(by Brian)</p>\n<p><em>[Note: The pictures in this post are taken from the Creative Commons section of Flickr.

But tonight I feel like telling you about Korean food. I&#8217;ve had the opportunity to try lots of foods in the months that I have been here so far. (Side note: WOW. It&#8217;s already been more than four months? Also: WOW. It&#8217;s only been four months?) Anyway, most of the food I&#8217;ve tried here is very tasty, and I&#8217;d like to tell you about it. I also want to convince you to come visit us, because if you do, we will feed you some of these foods. And maybe you can help us escape.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"  \" title=\"(Photo by Bob Jagendorf, used under Creative Commons Attribution 2.0 Generic License)\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/farm4.static.flickr.com/3334/5715033866_9a8d585379_z.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"331\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Because here&#039;s the secret I haven&#039;t told you: When we&#039;re not teaching, this is where they keep us.

But I still want to show you what we eat on a normal basis. Let&#8217;s start with the obvious.</p>\n<p><strong>Kimchi</strong></p>\n<p>Kimchi is the most famous Korean food, easily. Everyone knows about kimchi. What most of us don&#8217;t find out until after we&#8217;ve stepped off the plane, however, is the vast expanse of kimchi. There are, apparently, <a href=\"http://park.org/Cdrom/Pavilions/Kimchi/ekim0108.html\" target=\"_blank\">hundreds of varieties of kimchi</a>, and possibly more. Here is a sample of the kimchi I have tried: baechu kimchi (the most famous kind, the kind people envision when they hear the word &#8216;kimchi&#8217;), white kimchi (which is the same except without red spicy sauce), ggakdugi (spicy sweet radish cubed kimchi), some little white cubed radish kimchi that I don&#8217;t actually know the name of, sesame leaf kimchi, cucumber kimchi, whole radish kimchi, \u00a0kimchi made from leafy greens, and even water kimchi (it&#8217;s served in a bowl of cold, seasoned water and has a mild flavor). Kimchi has a lot of different flavors and the stuff here tastes much better than the kinds I tried back in America. However, people told me early on that it was not very good kimchi, and now I agree. The school&#8217;s kimchi is okay. I used to love it. But then I tried some homemade kimchi that had a perfect flavor. Now, everyday kimchi is still good, but&#8230;well, you now how it is. I tend to like kimchi that is more on the spicy side of the scale rather than the sour side. Although the sour kind is great for cooking with.</p>\n<p><div style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\" \" title=\"Photo by &quot;taylorandayumi&quot; [Flickr username, no real name given].

It is a way of eating food, and I love it. The simplest way to explain ssam is to say that you take your food, add some sauce, and wrap it in a piece of lettuce. It only sounds sort of interesting, but in practice, it&#8217;s awesome. First, you can make it out of many things. It&#8217;s most often made with pork, but you can eat it with beef, with chicken, with duck, with fish (even raw fish), with rice and vegetables, you name it. The sauce is called ssamjang (\uc308\uc7a5), and it is slightly spicy with a flavor that I don&#8217;t know the word for. I can&#8217;t simply say &#8216;salty&#8217; or &#8216;sweet.&#8217; It&#8217;s very good, though. People will often also put a clove or half-clove of garlic in the wrap before eating it.</p>\n<p>So inside the piece of lettuce, you have a piece of meat, some vegetables, garlic, and some sauce. Then you eat it in one bite, and it&#8217;s amazing. Usually the lettuce is a green leafy kind, not iceberg. Sometimes it&#8217;s not lettuce, though. My favorite is perilla. It is a leaf that has a flavor that is strong the same way that licorice is a strong flavor, and at first I thought it was very weird. Ssam can also be wrapped with seaweed or very thin slices of a daikon radish.</p>\n<p><div style=\"width: 385px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img title=\"Photo by &quot;joyosity&quot; [Flickr username, no real name given].

After cooking the noodles, you rinse them in cold water until they are no longer warm. There are two main kinds of naengmyeon, both made with the same type of noodles (made from buckwheat, potatoes, and sweet potatoes): bibim naengmyeon (\ube44\ube54\ub0c9\uba74) and mul laengmyeon (\ubb3c\ub0c9\uba74). \u00a0Bibim means something like &#8220;mixed,&#8221; and this kind has a spicy red sauce added to the cold noodles. Ashley really likes this kind of noodles because of the taste of the sauce and because of the texture of the noodles. They are not too thick but they also don&#8217;t break too easily, she says. Mul means &#8220;water,&#8221; and so this second kind of naengmyeon is rinsed with cold water and then put in a bowl with an icy-cold broth made of water, vinegar, and other seasonings. It often actually has slushy-like ice chunks in the broth, so it is very refreshing on a hot summer day.</p>\n<p>Both kinds often have other ingredients, such as thinly-cut vegetables or even Korean pears. And if you order a bowl of these noodles, you will get half of a hard-boiled egg that comes on top of the noodles. One of my co-workers told me to eat it first to keep the noodles from unsettling my stomach. Whenever Ashley and I make a bowl of instant naengmyeon, though, we don&#8217;t bother to cut up extra toppings or boil an egg.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img title=\"Photo by Jinho Jung.

In fact, The Korea Herald reported a survey that indicated ddeokbokki is the <a href=\"http://www.koreaherald.com/lifestyle/Detail.jsp?newsMLId=20110408000361\">most popular street food among foreigners</a>. So here is the street food entry for this list, although ddeokbokki (also commonly transliterated as tteokbokki) is not limited to street vendor carts. Restaurant and home versions of this meal are usually more complex, while what you can get on the street is, from what I can tell, more simple: ddeok, odeng, and the thick, gochujang-based sauce. Eggs, meat (chicken is popular), and vegetables are also common additions to this food. Now, I know a few recent words just went over your head. I&#8217;ll explain. Ddeok is &#8216;rice cake.&#8217; Some are spongy snacks you eat by themselves, and many foreigners think that they are bland (some of them are pretty heavy on the flour or bland beans, but I&#8217;ve had some filled with chocolate or jam that were awesome). Some are rock hard and have to be cooked, and they become soft and chewy. It is this second kind that is in ddeokbokki. In the gochujang sauce (gochujang is a spicy, pepper-based condiment), they become sticky and sweet with a very fun texture. The last part is odeng, which is a kind of fish cake. It&#8217;s not as bad as it sounds.</p>\n<p>Anyway, ddeokbokki is very spicy and it&#8217;s also a bit sweet. Sometimes people add it to ramyeon (ramen) for a super spicy dish that even I thought was <em>almost</em> too spicy. Ashley doesn&#8217;t care much for the rice cake part of ddeokbokki (which is good, I guess, because rice cakes aren&#8217;t exactly health foods, and, hey, more for me), but she likes the odeng and the sauce is good for mixing with other foods.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img title=\"Photo by KFoodaddict (Chloe Lim).

But it still looks so good to me.</p></div>\n<p><strong>Chicken</strong></p>\n<p>Wait. What? Chicken isn&#8217;t Korean food. It&#8217;s everyone&#8217;s food. Well, in Korea, the chicken is great. I&#8217;ve seen comments on Waygook (the foreign teachers&#8217; forum, where we discuss lesson ideas and life in Korea) that said fried chicken is one thing Korea does <a href=\"http://blogs.koreanclass101.com/blog/2010/01/19/western-food-in-korea-scary-and-expensive-with-a-side-of-pickles-p2/\"><em>better</em>\u00a0than most places in America</a>, and maybe it&#8217;s because I haven&#8217;t had American fried chicken in several months, but I tend to agree. The fried chicken (and other chicken) that I&#8217;ve had in Korea has not left me wanting. I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;ve had the best chicken of my life here, but I definitely haven&#8217;t had the worst.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s something interesting about chicken and kimchi that I&#8217;ve noticed. I mentioned kimchi already, but here&#8217;s something I didn&#8217;t say. Generally, kimchi is eaten at every meal. It&#8217;s a side dish, not an entree, but it shows up at nearly every meal. I think only at hamburger joints have I not seen kimchi. When you go to get chicken, you will get the white radish cubed kimchi, which has a mild and sweet flavor, and I expect that people repulsed by the idea of eating fermented cabbage probably wouldn&#8217;t object to this tamer variant. I think it&#8217;s a pretty good complement to chicken.</p>\n<p>When we were new to Korea, Ashley and I went to a few chicken places. Before we had the basic food vocabulary that we have now, our strategy in all restaurants was to simply pick an item at random and hope it wasn&#8217;t live octopus. The risk isn&#8217;t so high in a chicken shack, but we still often didn&#8217;t know what we were ordering. The first two times we ate chicken, the server expressed concern and said, &#8220;Umm&#8230;is spicy.&#8221; &#8220;Okay,&#8221; I replied. And yes, it was spicy (and delicious), but certainly not cause for alarm. However, the third place, which expressed a similar concern, was <em>completely warranted in its concern</em>. I don&#8217;t think I have ever <em>cried</em>\u00a0from spicy levels before that day. Okay, maybe my memory of the night has been exaggerated, but I do know that Ashley and I both felt the heat. And surprisingly, the chicken was chockfull of flavor. There&#8217;s always concern, when you make something too spicy, that the flavor will take the hit.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a very small chicken bar (as in, there are maybe four tables crammed in 120 square feet or so, including the kitchen space) near our apartment. Actually, there are several all in the same building. But this one in particular is run by a friendly couple. Once, when we were looking for a place to eat, the woman looked at us and gave us a friendly smile and said we could eat at her establishment. So they got our vote. And as for the quality of that chicken, well, we&#8217;ve been back.</p>\n<p>If you want a basic run-down of the differences between American fried chicken and Korean fried chicken, you can read <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/07/dining/07fried.html\">this page</a>.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img title=\"Photo by arnold | inuyaki (Arnold Gatilao).

Korea is different from any place I have ever been, and some of these differences I find rather beneficial, especially having kimchi at every meal; in my opinion it is unsurpassed for assisting with digestion, but I\u2019m sure most of you don\u2019t want to hear about that.</p>\n<p>1. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Koreans love to eat. When we think of Korean people we usually think of very slim, good looking folks who enjoy eating kimchi, at least I do. But although these stereotypes are generally true\u2014I haven\u2019t seen any obese Koreans yet&#8211;I\u2019d have to say that I don\u2019t know how Koreans stay so thin. They are obsessed with eating. Even their drinking culture isn\u2019t like what we would think of in the West. One of our lecturers told us that at every pub they go to, they order a full meal with their drinks and on a night of drinking they might go to three or four different places!</p>\n<p><strong>Cafeteria food from orientation:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>I don&#8217;t now what everything is called, but I think I love pumpkin porridge! That yellow stuff.</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/100_1245.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-58\" title=\"100_1245\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/100_1245.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/100_1245.jpg\"></a><strong>Kimchi, soup, peaches and things I don&#8217;t know what&#8230;\u00a0<a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/100_1244.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-57\" title=\"100_1244\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/100_1244.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Cafeteria Bibimbap, kimchi and tater-tots!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/100_1238.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-56\" title=\"100_1238\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/100_1238.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\n<p>Anyway, since coming to Korea I have never actually felt hunger. Not because I couldn\u2019t stand the food, because I like Korean food, but because during the orientation all of the meals were buffet style, and they just. Kept. Feeding us. Between meals there were cute little snacks, and there was always plenty, plenty to eat.\u00a0 And anyone who knows me knows how I feel about eating food.</p>\n<p>2. \u00a0 \u00a0 Korea is convenient. I\u2019m talking about the transportation system here. It\u2019s so easy to get your t-money card and go from subway to bus to taxi and it all counts as one trip.\u00a0 My t-money card is a little keychain that looks like a pink bear and I can charge it up with money at the subway station or convenience store, tap it on the subway turn-style thing and I\u2019m good to go. I can also get on a bus, tap the \u201ccard\u201d on a machine, and go. Some taxis even accept t-money cards. And I think it works in Seoul as well as here in Busan. That\u2019s almost like being able to use your transit card in LA and New York, which seems pretty convenient to me. Also, if I wanted to\u2014but I don\u2019t want to&#8211;I could use my check card as a t-money card and skip the refilling stage altogether. It\u2019s so nice!</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_66\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/100_1253.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-66 \" title=\"100_1253\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/100_1253.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">My T-money &quot;card.&quot;</p></div>\n<p>3. \u00a0 \u00a0Korea recycles. This isn\u2019t rocket science people. Ever since I went to Canada and saw all the recycling bins in public parks and pizza joints alike, I\u2019ve wondered why the USA doesn\u2019t have any similar initiatives. In Korea you can recycle almost anything for free; it\u2019s throwing out trash you have to pay for. During the orientation, we couldn\u2019t just dispose of our uneaten food in the garbage; we had to scrape all the leftovers into a bowl for composting. This, to me, is a good way to be responsible about our impact on the environment. Right now the United States as whole doesn\u2019t care about the environment, and, in a global community that\u2019s moving more toward solutions to our energy and resource problems, that makes me ashamed.</p>\n<p>4. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Korea has heated floors. The ondol is one of the most wonderful heating systems I have heretofore encountered. The whole house or apartment is heated by the hot water pipes under the floor, and you can control the temperature via thermostat. I don\u2019t quite understand all the functions yet, since they are in Korean, but I do like when I feel it start to warm up my feet, which are usually always cold. Dear Ondol, my feet thank you.</p>\n<p><strong>Some pictures of the Apartment (\uc544\ud30c\ud2b8)!</strong></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_59\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/100_1246.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-59 \" title=\"100_1246\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/100_1246.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kitchen</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_63\" style=\"width: 235px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/100_1250.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-63 \" title=\"100_1250\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/100_1250.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Bed seems bigger than the one back home...yay!</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_64\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/100_1251.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-64\" title=\"100_1251\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/100_1251.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">sliding door</p></div>\n<p>5. \u00a0 \u00a0And finally, Koreans speak Korean. My brain, like most other people\u2019s brains, is only interested in what it thinks is logically relevant or interesting. I think Korean culture and language is interesting, so I\u2019ve learned to read the Hangul alphabet and a few phrases, but acquiring language takes\u00a0<strong>use</strong>, and in America, there are so many reasons NOT to use Korean that I can\u2019t even count them. Coming to Korea has eliminated these have been and would-be barriers to my learning. In Korea I am actually immersed in a culture that speaks an\u00a0<em>entirely</em>different language. In order to make myself understood I have to change and grow. Thank you Korea for providing me with the chance to do so.</p>\n", "post_id": 55, "location": false, "date": "02-26-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>(by Brian)</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been a while. Sorry. Sometimes I feel that nothing new has happened worthy of blogging about, but on the other hand, that&#8217;s completely false. Why, I&#8217;ll give you a brief update on things that have happened over the last several weeks (and maybe one of us will write some more on these topics later).</p>\n<ol>\n<li>At the end of the semester, my school went on a retreat. We got on two tour buses and drove to another part of Korea, first to a nearby city called Changwon (\ucc3d\uc6d0) to listen to the leaders of a Christian boys&#8217; high school talk about their school (in Korean), then somewhere else in Korea to do some sightseeing. We were up in the mountains, secluded from pretty much anything except a butterfly museum and a cozy little hotel/lodge where we ate dinner and then stayed the night to resume some sightseeing activities the following day. It was very nice, although it was the first time I had been away from home overnight since I&#8217;ve been married. So Ashley was a bit sad, but she had gone to an orchestra and dinner with her school that evening. She came home pretty close to bed time, and I was back in Busan before she got off work the next day. A couple of times when I&#8217;ve been let early off of work, I&#8217;ve taken walks around the city until Ashley would get off work (I felt really healthy those days), so on that day, I waited outside Ashley&#8217;s school and sent her a text that read, without any untruth, &#8216;I should be home when you get there.&#8217; Then she saw me outside her school, waiting for her.</li>\n<li>We&#8217;ve been slowly making more friends. We go on almost-weekly hikes now with some other foreign teachers (and even one Korean who usually goes too) on the weekends. It&#8217;s fun, although it&#8217;s pretty intense sometimes. I&#8217;ve posted about <a href=\"http://129degreeseast.wordpress.com/2011/05/05/childrens-day-the-lovely-coast-of-igidae-park/\" target=\"_blank\">one of those hikes</a> before. That hike was kind to us, but one we went on recently almost made us turn back. Ashley had to take a break and our friends had to wait for us to catch up.</li>\n<li>We&#8217;ve started &#8216;summer vacation&#8217; which means, for Ashley&#8217;s school, that the students are out of school except some who signed up for special English classes. For my school, it means <em>all</em> the students have classes in the morning (for the first few weeks of vacation, then they actually get a break), but most of them get to go home after lunch or stay at school to self-study or take a special class (such as my conversation class with six students). So Ashley has a few hours of work in the morning, and I have a couple of hours of work in the afternoon (one hour with six students and one hour with five teachers). But we still have to be there the whole day.</li>\n<li>We&#8217;ve been learning Korean. And that is the main theme of this post.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Starting July 4, Ashley and I have been taking classes twice a week (Monday and Thursday) at Pusan National University. We&#8217;re not enrolled or anything like that. It&#8217;s just that a group students from PNU volunteer to teach Korean for free to \uc678\uad6d\uc778 (foreigners) like us. Most of the teachers have one or two students, so we get very concentrated attention.</p>\n<p>I said that one Korean goes with us on the hikes sometimes. Her name is JiHee, and she saw me post some sentences in Korean on Facebook, so she told me about the classes and invited us to join. The next &#8216;term&#8217; was beginning, so we were just in time to take the placement test and begin the summer classes on July 4. Our teacher is named Hyeonseok (\ud604\uc11d) and he&#8217;s cool. He&#8217;s our age (no, really, the three of us are all age 26 in the Korean way of counting age) and a very nice guy, but he does push us hard in class. He gave us homework to start a Korean diary, plus he assigned us to choose 10 new verbs and write sentences in the past and present tense. The next class period, he asked us to write sentences in the future and continuous tense. So it&#8217;s pretty intense.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s pretty good because I often listen to Korean lessons on talktomeinkorean.com (TTMIK), and I&#8217;m on the third level in that program, but I don&#8217;t really have in-person feedback on my learning. Hyeonseok gives that to us. He often tells me, &#8216;Well, the sentence is grammatical, but Koreans wouldn&#8217;t say it that way.&#8217; And that&#8217;s the kind of help we need. It&#8217;s also good because TTMIK teaches a &#8216;middle&#8217; level of formality, and Hyeonseok is starting us with the &#8216;high&#8217; level of formality. He makes us read sentences out loud so we can practice pronunciation, and once he even wrote some dates on a piece of paper and had us read them as fast as we could. It was stressful but helpful.</p>\n<p>Over the last few weeks I&#8217;ve really felt an increase in my motivation to learn Korean. Sometimes I&#8217;m lazy and don&#8217;t want to do it. But now I feel like, sometimes, I can actually understand a few things I read or hear. But usually only what I read. My ear is still rather untrained in hearing Korean, so I need to work on that. I listen to people talk to try to understand what they say, but mostly I just catch \uc9c4\uc9dc (really?) or some other very common word.</p>\n<p>The part of learning Korean that is the hardest is thinking of an end goal. Why are we learning Korean? And it&#8217;s a good question. We won&#8217;t be here long enough to become completely fluent in the language unless we&#8217;re here for three or four years, and then we&#8217;d be gone (unless we stay even longer). And outside of Korea, the Korean language isn&#8217;t very useful. People only speak Korean in South Korea, North Korea, and special Korean-heavy areas of China and Russia (I think). Once we go back to America, it will be difficult to maintain whatever level of Korean we attain (so I plan on finding some kind of webcam language exchange or something). And our jobs require us to speak English. So why are we learning Korean?</p>\n<p>Ashley says I want to impress people. Which I guess is true. I&#8217;ve come to admit some things about myself I previously denied (see <a href=\"http://129degreeseast.wordpress.com/2011/06/19/of-celebrity/\" target=\"_blank\">Of Celebrity</a>), and one of those things is that I do like to impress people. But is that my only reason? I think not. I also know, from college and my professors, that knowing and using multiple languages is good for your brain. One benefit is the prevention of Alzheimer&#8217;s. And language has been shown to have an influence on the way people think and view the world. If I can learn a new language (especially one so different from English), then I can broaden my mind and think more deeply. If I learn enough Korean, I can also speak Korean to my children, and they will have a great headstart on multilingualism and thus will be geniuses who never get Alzheimer&#8217;s.</p>\n<p>Also, I think learning one new language makes learning more languages even easier. I&#8217;d like to know Spanish, and if I tackle a difficult language like Korean, then learning Spanish will be a piece of cake in comparison. I&#8217;ve actually grown to adopt some Spanish phrases more deeply than English phrases over the years, and now that I&#8217;m in Korea, that fact is even bigger. I don&#8217;t know why. Maybe I&#8217;m in a country with a foreign language and Spanish is a <em>familiar</em> foreign language. So now, instead of &#8216;Are you ready?&#8217; I often think of the phrase &#8216;Est\u00e1s listo?&#8217; Or instead of &#8216;Where?&#8217; I think &#8216;D\u00f3nde?&#8217;</p>\n<p>So why not learn Spanish right now? It would be an easy language to learn and it would be very useful back home in America or in one of more than 20 countries where it is the official or most dominant language. Well, I&#8217;m in Korea right now. It is the best language for me to learn considering the environment. I can&#8217;t practice Spanish at restaurants or at the street markets. I came to Korea for many reasons, but one of those reasons was to experience a completely different culture, and part of that experience involves the language. I don&#8217;t want to leave this country without learning a decent amount of the language.</p>\n<p>Besides, how many non-Korean Americans can say they know Korean? Yes, I like doing things that are different, and maybe that is my biggest reason for learning Korean.</p>\n<p>As for the language itself, here are some things I have learned about Korean.</p>\n<p>People say the language is really difficult to learn. Many even say it&#8217;s one of the hardest languages to learn. Maybe it is, but I think it&#8217;s still possible. Here are the reasons they give for Korean being so difficult. (You can pretty much quit here if you want. It&#8217;s pretty technical from here on out.)</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Korean is an SOV language while English is an SVO language</strong>. The letters stand for subject, verb, and object. So in English, a typical sentence reads, &#8216;I ate food.&#8217; In Korean, the same equivalent sentence is \uc800\ub294 \uc74c\uc2dd\uc744 \uba39\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. The words in order are I, food, ate. It can be even more complex with things like &#8216;I went to the school.&#8217; The sentence is \uc800\ub294 \ud559\uad50\uc5d0 \uac14\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. I, school, to, went. So people say it&#8217;s difficult to learn to speak in a different order, but with practice, it&#8217;s not really so bad. With really simple sentences it&#8217;s almost not even a problem. You just have to get used to knowing<em> first</em> what\u00a0is <em>involved</em> in the sentence and not what is <em>happening</em>.</li>\n<li><strong>The Korean alphabet isn&#8217;t as easy as people say it is.</strong>\u00a0First of all, yes, the Korean alphabet is different. But it was invented to be easy. It&#8217;s estimated you can learn it in an hour, average. But there are special rules for pronunciation. If a syllable ends in \u314c (t) \u00a0and the next one begins \uc774 (ee), for example, then the two letters combine to form \uce58 (chee). And there are several rules like this, but they make pronunciation easier, actually. We have the same rule in English in a way. How do you say &#8216;Don&#8217;t you?&#8217; We say, &#8216;Donchew?&#8217; right? Because we took the &#8216;t&#8217; from the first word and combined it with the &#8216;ee&#8217; sound that &#8216;you&#8217; starts with (say ee-oo quickly) and turned it into &#8216;ch.&#8217; Another rule is that if a \u3139 (which can be R if there is one of them between vowels or an L if it is at the end of one syllable and the beginning of the next) follows a consonant instead of a vowel, it turns into \u3134 (n). In Korean, the R is actually a flapped R like in Spanish (not the rolled RR, but the single R, which is flapped). Saying that flap after a consonant is very awkward. A plain &#8216;English&#8217; R is easy to say after a consonant because it&#8217;s a &#8216;liquid&#8217; sound, but the flap is not so &#8216;liquid.&#8217; So Koreans turn it into an N and it&#8217;s a piece of cake.</li>\n<li><strong>Korean has built-in formality levels</strong>. The argument is that Korean is difficult because you have to learn several words just to learn one word, because you have to conjugate the verb based on whom you&#8217;re speaking with, depending on your age and the listener&#8217;s age, your title/job/status, where you are (home, work, etc.), and so on. The sentence I wrote earlier, about eating food? Check this out:</li>\n<ol>\n<li>\uc800\ub294 \uc74c\uc2dd\uc744 \uba39\uc5c8\uc5b4</li>\n<li>\uc800\ub294 \uc74c\uc2dd\uc744 \uba39\uc5c8\uc5b4\uc694</li>\n<li>\uc800\ub294 \uc74c\uc2dd\uc744 \uba39\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4</li>\n<li>\ub098\ub294 \uc74c\uc2dd\uc744 \uba39\uc5c8\uc5b4</li>\n<li>\ub098\ub294 \uc74c\uc2dd\uc744 \uba39\uc5c8\uc5b4\uc694</li>\n<li>\ub098\ub294 \uc74c\uc2dd\uc744 \uba39\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4</li>\n<li>\uc804 \uc74c\uc2dd\uc744 \uba39\uc5c8\uc5b4</li>\n<li>\uc804 \uc74c\uc2dd\uc744 \uba39\uc5c8\uc5b4\uc694</li>\n<li>\uc804 \uc74c\uc2dd\uc744 \uba39\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4</li>\n<li>\ub09c \uc74c\uc2dd\uc744 \uba39\uc5c8\uc5b4</li>\n<li>\ub09c \uc74c\uc2dd\uc744 \uba39\uc5c8\uc5b4\uc694</li>\n<li>\ub09c \uc74c\uc2dd\uc744 \uba39\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4<br />\nThese are all ways to say &#8216;I ate food.&#8217; And there are even more ways to say it (I only used the three most common forms of the verb for &#8216;to eat'; there are seven levels of formality in Korean, but a few of them are rather rare). In reality, though, some of these are not very common. Sentences 4-6 and 10-12 use a form of the word for &#8216;I&#8217; that is informal and usually not used with the polite form of &#8216;ate&#8217; seen in numbers 3, 6, 9, and 12. And numbers 7-12 are only different because they use contractions of the word for I (sort of like the difference between &#8216;do not&#8217; and &#8216;don&#8217;t&#8217;). All in all, yes, there are many ways to say the same exact thing in Korean, and you have to keep in mind the social situation in order to speak properly, but once you learn the endings that correspond to different formalities, it&#8217;s pretty easy to remember what the word is. And you&#8217;ll see that the difference between 1 and 2, 4 and 5, 7 and 8, and 10 and 11 is just one syllable at the very end of the word. You add that syllable to be more polite and you take it out if you are speaking to someone you&#8217;re close to or who is younger. Very easy. [Note: Ashley reminded me of another thing. It can be interpreted as something that is harder or easier about the language. I choose to think it's easier. In Korean, you can remove words if the context will provide that information. So I could take out the word for 'I' and people would still know that I ate food, even if I only said 'ate food.' If I spoke about a friend and then said 'ate food,' you would know it was my friend who ate the food.]</li>\n</ol>\n<li><strong>Korean uses two number systems</strong>. Yeah, it&#8217;s true. There are two words for every number. At least up to 100. Beyond that, people just use the same system that money is counted with, which is good because it&#8217;s the easier system. We don&#8217;t really have two number systems in English, although we do have four different suffixes for ordinal numbers (st, nd, rd, th as in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Having said all that (whew, you read a lot), there are many things I appreciate about the Korean language. Some of the differences will take me some time to get used to, but once I know them, they will make the language so much easier. For just one example that I&#8217;ve learned so far, there&#8217;s a particle that means &#8216;also&#8217; in Korean. It is -\ub3c4, and you add it to whatever part is &#8216;also.&#8217; Try this sentence: &#8216;Sam also went to get some food.&#8217; What does also mean? Sam went, but Carl went, too? Sam went to get some water, but also some food? Or Sam did something at home and then he also went to get food? There are three possibilities in English. In Korean, you have to choose which one is true. You can attach -\ub3c4 to Sam, which means someone else also went; or you can attach it to food, which means Sam bought other things; or you can attach it to went, and it means that Sam did multiple actions.</p>\n<p>Well I fear I&#8217;m making this blog too long and too technical. Also, it&#8217;s pretty late here. \uc798 \uc2dc\uac04\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. (It&#8217;s time for bed.)</p>\n<p>UPDATE: I nearly forgot. Here&#8217;s another reason I want to learn Korean, a big reason. Back in high school, maybe 9th or 10th grade, I learned about Hangeul (\ud55c\uae00), the Korean writing system, and about how it was made to be easy. I decided to look it up. I learned it from the Internet, but it wasn&#8217;t much later that I forgot most of it (I did pick it up again here in Korea pretty quick though, and remembered a few things from that time, eight or nine years ago). I don&#8217;t remember every detail, but I probably stopped after learning the alphabet and learning that the actual language was very difficult to learn. Imagine if I had decided to spend just a few hours each week trying to prove those claims wrong. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;d be fluent by now.</p>\n<p>And there&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve known about myself for a long time now, and it&#8217;s that I&#8217;m a quitter. Well, in my life I&#8217;m trying to quit that (pun intended, and I would say sorry, but that would be a lie; I just really like puns), and I feel that finally learning Korean, no matter how long it takes, will be one great step toward reversing that terrible trait.</p>\n", "post_id": 553, "location": false, "date": "07-30-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>We made a new video.

It will therefore be in sections. This first section deals with what happened just before our trip began.</em></p>\n<p>Our six-day-five-night trip to South Korea&#8217;s volcanic island started on the wrong foot. I&#8217;m not even sure I would call it a foot. Maybe it started on a knee or an elbow. Yet we carried on.</p>\n<p>We left early Sunday morning. Our flight was at 7:30 am, so, in keeping with the general rule of two hours, we wanted to arrive at Busan&#8217;s Gimhae International Airport by 5:30. As we would soon find out, it was a completely unnecessary motivation, and if we had not had it, I&#8217;m sure things would have turned out differently.</p>\n<p>We woke up shortly after four, to be sure we could leave by 4:45 and ensure our arrival. I factored in the time it might take to find a taxi at such an early hour, the possibility of airport traffic, and, according to my usual methods, some extra time tacked on just in case. All of it, of course, unnecessary. We found a taxi in just a few minutes and it took us to the airport in less than 20 minutes and for less than 10,000 won ($9.20).</p>\n<p>And then our vacation was ruined. A few moments after stepping out of the cab, I tapped my pocket in the same manner my father had taught me long ago. It&#8217;s an action I perform dozens of times each day without thought. The idea is to be sure your wallet is still there. The downside is that, if you touch your pocket and feel no wallet, the only difference is that now you <em>know</em> your wallet is gone. It doesn&#8217;t make the wallet any less gone. But it does help narrow down the possibilities of time and place of loss. After a quick scan of the sidewalk and road revealed no out-of-place bundle of leather, the instant conclusion was that I somehow dropped my wallet in the cab. Which was now well away from us.</p>\n<p>There wasn&#8217;t a single thing I could do. If I had known I was going to drop my wallet, I would have looked more thoroughly at the cab driver&#8217;s information plate, so I could call him and ask him to turn around. (Actually, I would have just more thoroughly secured my wallet.) But as the driver had done no wrong (in fact, I was about to overpay him, because I thought the toll for the tunnel was more than it was, having misread the <em>Korean</em> signs, and he made sure to take no more money than what I owed), I had no need to write down his information to make a complaint.</p>\n<p>Yet I called my co-teacher, the one responsible for taking care of me. I didn&#8217;t know what she could do, but nonetheless I tried. Of course, 5:15 in the morning is probably not her ideal time to receive phone calls. And she didn&#8217;t answer. Her phone is probably on silent in the night hours. That&#8217;s reasonable. I sent her a text: &#8216;At airport, lost wallet in cab. \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c?&#8217; (That Korean word, eo-ddeo-ke, literally means &#8216;how&#8217; but in context also can mean &#8216;What do I do?&#8217;) She would see it later.</p>\n<p>After coming to terms, I was glad that I also learned another lesson from my father (thank you, Dad, for teaching me so much in my life). That lesson is to split your money. Don&#8217;t carry it all in one place. After withdrawing money for our trip, we split it between Ashley and me, and I further split some between my wallet and in a pocket in my messenger bag. So cash losses were very limited.</p>\n<p>Which left only cards to worry about. The airport, luckily, had an Internet zone to use for free, although the computers were slow. I logged onto my credit card account and tried to send a message to stop the card, but I needed to call. I found out that my pay-as-you-go cell phone doesn&#8217;t allow international calls, so I sent a Facebook message to my parents to call and have my card stopped and to tell my bank to stop the debit card.</p>\n<p>But that still left my ATM cards. Yes, I have two bank accounts in Korea because EPIK opened KEB accounts for everyone at Orientation, but many schools pay their employees through particular banks. In Busan, it&#8217;s usually Busan Bank. I had asked if it was truly necessary, and even my co-teacher, who had her own account already, had to open an extra one to be paid. If she had to, I knew that my foreigner self would have to as well. And although no one who could find my wallet would know my PINs, they could still make purchases at the check-out counter.</p>\n<p>I briefly considered canceling our trip, but given the timing, we wouldn&#8217;t have received a penny in return. That deadline was two weeks ago. Also, what could I do if we didn&#8217;t go? Absolutely nothing that would in any way help me retrieve my wallet. I counted on stopping cards and hoped that it was unnecessary because of the generosity of Koreans. I&#8217;ve heard several stories about losing things in Korea, thinking that they&#8217;re forever gone, only to find that, for example, someone used your cell phone&#8217;s contact list to call people until finding out your address, and then mailing your phone to you. Or checking your ID card&#8217;s address and mailing your wallet or purse there. So I hoped for that, but I knew it was also possible for my wallet to fall into the wrong hands. Thus the precautions.</p>\n<p>So we went through check-in and security. We had to wait to check-in, because counters didn&#8217;t even open until maybe six. And security took five minutes. I was thankful that we were going to Jeju because, without my foreigner card (which was in my wallet), I&#8217;m stuck in Korea. Our visas are single-entry. The foreigner card allows multiple entry. So if I leave without the foreigner card, I can&#8217;t get back in with my passport alone. I need the foreigner card. So choosing a South Korean island rather than one in the Philippines, as we had considered, turned out to be a good decision.</p>\n<p>In the terminal, we saw two fellow English teachers, twins Genessa and Anushka, who are stationed in Daegu. We knew that they were also going to Jeju, but as it turned out, they were on our same flight. We told them about my lost wallet and they offered some encouragement. Much appreciated. They also told us about someone they knew who just withdrew $50,000 and then lost it. Ouch.</p>\n<p>So we went to Jeju, but I was in a miserable state, worried that I had put my family (that is, Ashley and me) into financial ruin by the chance that someone would manage to ruin my good credit before I could do anything to stop it.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll put a stop to your worries now and tell you that eventually I got the bank cards deactivated. It wasn&#8217;t easy. My co-teacher thought that I would need to talk to the banks myself, but I mentioned how I couldn&#8217;t speak Korean. Not to mention, it was Sunday. Could I do anything about it then? And the next day was a national holiday. It might be Tuesday before anything was fixed. That&#8217;s two whole days of opportunity for any would-be identity thieves.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, I have a very kind and awesome friend named Gloria. She is Korean but was raised in New Zealand. She&#8217;s also an EPIK teacher, but one who knows Korean. And she&#8217;s the one who invited us to the Jesus Generation Movement church meetings we attend. So if I can&#8217;t count on a fellow Christian, colleague, and friend, who can I count on? I really hated to bother her, but this was important. So I called her and explained my situation, about how I couldn&#8217;t even understand the phone menu for Busan Bank and how KEB, as friendly as it is to foreigners, seemed not to be answering their foreigner phone lines this weekend. She called back within a half an hour and told me that the cards were now deactivated. I even got a text from one of the banks to confirm (it was in Korean, but in context I understood). God bless Gloria and people like her. She also took it upon herself to ask if any charges had been made in the last twelve hours. The answer was, thankfully, no.</p>\n", "post_id": 582, "location": false, "date": "08-20-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>(by Brian)</p>\n<p>I guess we&#8217;ll get all of the bad stuff out of the way. In this post I&#8217;ll talk about transportation on Jeju Island. To put it bluntly, I hate transportation on Jeju Island. I&#8217;ve come to prize the efficiency of Busan&#8217;s transportation system and even Seoul&#8217;s sprawling network of subways, buses, and taxis. But in Jeju? Not at all. Of course, I spent less than a full week on that island, but regardless, I&#8217;m glad to be back in Busan, in regards with transportation.</p>\n<p>Jeju, <a href=\"http://129degreeseast.wordpress.com/2011/08/20/jejudo-prologue/\" target=\"_blank\">as I mentioned before</a>, is a volcanic island. The Korean peninsula is mountainous, but the island of Jeju <em>is</em> a mountain. It makes sense that neither \uc81c\uc8fc\uc2dc (Jeju-si/Jeju City) nor \uc11c\uadc0\ud3ec\uc2dc (Seogwipo-si/Seogwipo City) has a subway system. In fact, both cities contain lots of rural areas. I spent much of the week wrapping my head around a city that goes from dense and urban to grassy and rural to calm and coastal in just a matter of miles. At least it seemed that way. My point is, rural areas are not exactly prime real estate for the underground rail market. That leaves buses and taxis.</p>\n<p>But that&#8217;s still a problem. In Busan, I ride buses every day and the subway at least two or three times a week. In Jeju-si, I rode buses only a few times. Why? Because buses in Jeju are terrible. They&#8217;re more scattered, for one, and quite infrequent. Depending on the bus number, the frequency in Busan is potentially fifteen minutes at the most, and sometimes as low as fifteen seconds (of course, it&#8217;s always frustrating when you see two number 179s come back-to-back while you&#8217;re waiting for a number 17), with an average of maybe eight or nine minutes. In Jeju? I&#8217;m not sure about downtown, where we didn&#8217;t need buses as much because we simply opted to walk (a fifteen-minute walk to the seaside Food Street and a nearby waterfall? Okay!), but in the rural areas, the standard rule seemed to be more like twenty or thirty minutes.</p>\n<p>And even then, we couldn&#8217;t figure it out. In Busan, buses and bus stops have clear listings of where buses go. Sometimes the bus stop will have the same route map that the inside of the bus will have, to let you know every stop for each number bus that comes to that stop. Sometimes they only list the prominent ones, but even then you have a general idea of where the bus is headed. In Jeju? We didn&#8217;t have a clue. The first time we tried waiting for a bus to save money on taxis, I spent probably fifteen minutes of our thirty-minute wait trying to figure out the chart, and at the end I was no more enlightened than I was before we got to the bus stop.</p>\n<p>Which was in the middle of nowhere:</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_592\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/img_2993.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-592\" title=\"IMG_2993\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/img_2993.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">I snapped this really quick while there wasn&#039;t a car in sight.</p></div>\n<p>If you look closely, you can see that there&#8217;s a lane at this intersection designated for U-turns. I appreciated that, because it meant we could hail a cab from either direction. Most intersections in Jeju seemed to have this useful lane (and a number of them in Busan as well). And hail a cab we did, after a bus finally came and the driver thoughtfully informed us that, if we were going to downtown Seogwipo, his bus wasn&#8217;t. So we waited another five or six minutes for an empty taxi to come by.</p>\n<p>The taxi experience on Jeju was rather interesting and made for quite a bit of our adventure on the island. With such a limited public transportation system, we often had to use taxis. Of course, we tried to do everyone together in terms of location on the island, to save money. In a way, it was nice, because taxi rides are very comfortable and quick. In other ways, it wasn&#8217;t nice, because taxis are expensive (although still much cheaper in Korea than in most other countries, it seems, by what other English teachers have said). Also, in the more rural areas, taxis aren&#8217;t as common as they were downtown or even in the sparsest areas of Busan.</p>\n<p>The worst taxi experience we had on Jeju was on Tuesday night. We were leaving a rather lonely area, but one that was rather popular because of a few tourist attractions. We had tried getting there by bus, but going to a PC bang (an Internet cafe) and looking up the bus information was no help. We took a taxi, and it cost about 16,000 won, or a little under 16 dollars. (I&#8217;m glad that most attractions themselves in Jeju are very cheap). It&#8217;s a bit pricey, but not too bad. On the other hand, getting back to our hotel was not nearly as fun.</p>\n<p>After a few minutes, we finally saw an empty taxi. We hopped in and I felt a little uneasy. As I was opening the door, the decals on the door looked briefly like police decals. But it was a taxi. I shook off the uneasy feeling. When we got in, I told the driver where we wanted to go. He didn&#8217;t know what we were talking about, so we told him a different nearby landmark to go to. Then he said, &#8216;\uc774\ub9cc\uc624\ucc9c\uc6d0.&#8217; We know what that means, but he proceeded to show us 25,000 won so we would know what he meant.</p>\n<p>Oh, so he wanted to charge us 25,000 won, eh? When it cost nearly 9,000 won less to go the same distance. I tried to ask him what the deal was, but of course he just spoke in Korean. I remembered reading, just a few days before, that no matter what, you should always insist on the meter. So I did just that. I pointed at the meter and said &#8216;Meter.&#8217; Okay, it&#8217;s in English, but the Korean words for things like meter and kilometer are, well, meter and kilometer. I figured he should know &#8216;meter,&#8217; especially if I point at it.</p>\n<p>He answered me in a rational Korean tone. I imagine what he said was something like this: &#8216;I can speak Korean, but you can&#8217;t, so even though I&#8217;m trying to rip you off, I&#8217;m speaking in a rational tone so you think that there&#8217;s a good reason I can&#8217;t use the meter now. I&#8217;ll pretend it&#8217;s because it&#8217;s night, even though it&#8217;s not even 9:30, or that it&#8217;s because you&#8217;re going so far, even though you probably came here by a metered taxi for a fair price.&#8217;</p>\n<p>Then he started to drive. Nuh-uh. I&#8217;m a person who&#8217;s still learning to stand up for himself, so it was especially important for me to do what I did here. I told him, &#8216;\uc5ec\uae30&#8217; (yeogi). It means &#8216;here&#8217; and it&#8217;s the way you tell a cab driver to &#8216;stop here.&#8217; There&#8217;s also the more polite form of &#8216;\uc5ec\uae30\uc694,&#8217; with &#8216;yo&#8217; added to the end, which is what I usually use. He didn&#8217;t respond at all. I said it probably four times. He kept going. Finally I said, &#8216;\uc5ec\uae30 \uc8fc\uc138\uc694&#8217; (yeogi juseyo). It wasn&#8217;t quite a correct sentence (it means &#8216;please give me here&#8217;), but \uc8fc\uc138\uc694 is a form that means both &#8216;please give me&#8217; and &#8216;please do for me.&#8217; But in order for it to mean &#8216;please do for me,&#8217; you have to connect it with the verb you want to be done. I didn&#8217;t know that word, so I just said &#8216;please give me here.&#8217;</p>\n<p>Thankfully (or not, as you will see), it worked. He stopped. I started to open the door and considered giving him some money. But what was I to give him? His asking price of 25,000 won? No, we didn&#8217;t go that far. So of course I gave him what the meter read: zero. He could have received at least a base fare of 2,200 won for 20 seconds or so of driving, but he refused to start the meter (and if he had used it, he would have received a full payment around 16,000 won). So even though I later started to feel guilty about not giving at least the base fare, I did feel kind of justified by the fact that, by all appearances, he seemed to be trying to rip us off and, in addition, the meter read <em>zero</em>.</p>\n<p>So we got out of the cab and the driver drove away. I believe he sneered at us while he did.</p>\n<p>So now all we had to do was wait for another taxi on this lonely road. That was the worst part, and the part that made us wonder if we should have just accepted the 9,000 won rip-off in order to actually have a ride home. Cabs were still passing by, but they seemed to have occupants. We continued to walk as we waited for cabs, and once in a while we&#8217;d see one with \ube48\ucc28 (bin cha) lit up in the window, which means &#8216;empty car.&#8217; I&#8217;d stick my hand out in the polite Korean gesture, and reactions were varied, but equally disturbing. Some cab drivers sped on as if they didn&#8217;t see us. A few slowed down and, after getting a good look at us, sped away. I think one even turned off the \ube48\ucc28 after seeing us.</p>\n<p><em>What was going on?</em></p>\n<p>Ashley wasn&#8217;t quite serious when she suggested that perhaps the cab driver angrily called the other drivers and warned them about us, but it seemed to be true, as unbelievable as it was. After maybe 25 minutes of walking, I realized it would take us hours. We&#8217;d have to walk until some morning driver on a different shift spotted us. I started feeling sorry for what I had inadvertently put my wife through, with images of us having to sleep in some field or dragging our exhausted bodies to our hotel room at dawn running through my mind. Finally, though, we found a driver who stopped for us and took us to where we needed to go.</p>\n<p>For much less than 25,000 won.</p>\n<p>We also did in fact take a few buses. On Wednesday, we went to Jeju-si (we stayed in Seogwipo-si) and visited a few attractions on that side of the island. To get there, we took the same bus that brought us from the airport to Seogwipo. In America, a similar airport shuttle bus from Michigan City to O&#8217;Hare cost $25 one way. It would cost Ashley and me almost $100 to go round trip. This shuttle was very nice, at 5,000 won a ticket. Round trip price of around $20, around one-fifth of the cost for nearly the same distance traveled. The shuttle also ran every 20 minutes rather than every hour. So naturally, we took that bus rather than spending who knows how much on a taxi to the other side.</p>\n<p>Once in Jeju-si again, we went into the airport itself and a tourist desk worker with excellent English kindly helped us figure a cheap way to go to where we wanted to go by bus. So we took that bus route and eventually got to where we had to get off. (Jeju-si, being the capital city, would have more buses, we thought, and it turned out that we were probably correct.)</p>\n<p>Of course, we still had to walk a ways:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/img_3064.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-593\" title=\"IMG_3064\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/img_3064.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a>But two kilometers was not much at all. In fact, after fifty minutes on a bus, Ashley said it would be good exercise. It also got us an unexpected discount at one of the two attractions that we visited at the end of this two-kilometer walk!</p>\n<p><em>Tune into 129\u00b0 East later for more details on Brian &amp; Ashley&#8217;s Adventures in Jeju!</em></p>\n<p>[Note: Not all cab drivers were like the one described in this post. In fact, toward the end of our Jeju-si Day Activities, we visited an attraction closer to the bus terminal, where we returned after the two attractions mentioned above, but in the interest of time we took a cab. On the way back, the driver asked where our next destination was (in awesome English), after we had already said the airport. I wondered why he cared, but then we said Seogwipo. He asked if we wanted to go to the shuttle bus. So then I realized, he wanted to know which part of the airport to take us to. But not only did he thoughtfully keep that in mind, he dropped us off one of the stops for that shuttle bus, saving us money on the cab fare and bypassing about fifteen minutes of the shuttle travel time.]</p>\n", "post_id": 591, "location": false, "date": "08-21-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>As Brian has mentioned before, Jeju-do (Jeju island) is volcanic. That means that the soil is very good for growing things, all sorts of things. Jeju is particularly famous for citrus fruits like halla-bong and other tangerines. In the neighborhoods we walked through, I also saw several persimmon trees, what looked like a few nut trees growing wild, and once even some pomegranates. The richness of the soil is not wasted at all. And, as it turns out, the soil as well as the weather conditions make the island an optimal environment for growing tea. So during our vacation we decided to go to a green tea farm. I enjoy drinking tea (hot, iced, or whatever) so I was especially curious about what the tea farm would be like. Also, I heard they made special ice cream.</p>\n<p>On Jeju island the green tea facility is called O&#8217;Sulloc Green Tea museum. In front of the museum there are some nice topiary-like shrubs shaped like tea cups:</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_599\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/img_2931.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-599\" title=\"IMG_2931\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/img_2931.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">OoOoh!</p></div>\n<p>This picture was taken by a friendly person who offered to help us take a picture together.&#8221;\uac19\uc774&#8221; they said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_600\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/img_2936.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-600\" title=\"IMG_2936\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/img_2936.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">They kind of cut off Brian&#039;s head, but it was an appreciated gesture.</p></div>\n<p>Before entering the museum itself, we tramped through the green tea fields for a little while. The fields were beautiful and green, with rocky volcanic soil, buzzing insects, and the light fragrance of something very essential: manure. The sun was bright that day, and it was hot. As is their custom, Korean women walked around with parasols to protect their skin; as is customary for me, I relied on my God-given brownness. It was really a delight to watch everyone taking fun pictures standing in the rows. So Brian wanted us to capture these \u00a0moment as well.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_602\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/img_2939.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-602\" title=\"IMG_2939\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/img_2939.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">but not without hardships on my part.</p></div>\n<p>As I have mentioned already, the sun was bright that day, and even though my skin was drinking in the sun with joy, my eyes do not share its enthusiasm. I was happy to be in the fields of the tea that I enjoy so much, but my feet were not happy on the rocky soil, considering my footgear (flip-flops). My nose was a little offended by the rich, wholesome smells of the fertilized earth, and I really wanted some of that famous green tea ice cream. But not before taking an idyllic photo of my beloved surrounded by a lush field-full of the leaves that I love:</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_603\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/img_2942.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-603\" title=\"IMG_2942\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/img_2942.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Look at him. Isn&#039;t he so happy and cute? Okay, I know you can&#039;t see his face, but take my word for it.</p></div>\n<p>After this we made our way inside. Because it was hot, and because I wanted ice cream. But before we could have any, we had to get some culture. So we paused to contemplate the tea exhibit and learn about its origins, how it has been served in various cups, and poured from various kettles including those carved entirely from a single block of stone. Finally we learned about the health benefits of tea, and how it was imported to England in the 16th century. Very interesting.</p>\n<p>The tea was equally interesting, and I don&#8217;t mean that as some sort of euphemism. They had free samples of freshly brewed tea, which was much more fragrant and flavorful than the cheap green tea I had back at the apartment, many people were gathered around to taste the tea, and I smiled at the taste, knowing that I was soon going to have to buy some of my own to take home.</p>\n<p>Although it was listed on the tourist maps as the O&#8217;Sulloc Green Tea Museum, the main feature of the museum seemed to be the cafe, which was bustling. The line for the\u00a0comestibles\u00a0was long, but people were happy to stand in it. The cafe chairs both inside and outside the cafe were full of folks eating and drinking. The cafe&#8217;s menu boasted such delights as green tea ice cream, cake, and cookies, and even an absolutely delicious iced citron green tea. After making our purchases we waited with a buzzer for our order.</p>\n<p>This is what we got:</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_604\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/img_2944.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-604\" title=\"IMG_2944\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/img_2944.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">I doubt that any of this has much health value but it was oh so lovely to eat.</p></div>\n<p>After we ate our treats, we decided to go up onto the observatory decks and survey the fields from above.

Halla (known in Korea as \ud55c\ub77c\uc0b0 and pronounced Hallasan; each &#8216;a&#8217; is pronounced &#8216;ah,&#8217; and &#8216;san&#8217; means &#8216;mountain,&#8217; so &#8216;Mt. Hallasan&#8217; is redundant). Halla Mountain is the highest mountain in the Republic of Korea (South Korea), and we hiked it. It is only too bad, as you also know from the video, that we did not go all the way to the top. We cannot therefore say that we hiked to the highest point in South Korea.</p>\n<p>But it was definitely the highest I&#8217;ve ever climbed in my life. We went on a backpacking trip for Wilderness Living class in college, and that lasted a weekend. However, we hiked mostly horizontal distance (with some inclines), not vertical. On Mount Halla, we continuously traveled upward. It was a bit of a work-out.</p>\n<p>We had planned a few things earlier in the week. On Tuesday, we decided that on Wednesday we would head to Jeju-si to see a few sites there. On Thursday, then, we would hike Hallasan. We should have consulted the weather report, of course, but that unfortunately did not cross our minds. Things would have been much different.</p>\n<p>We woke up around seven in the morning, so that we could perhaps be on the mountain by nine or ten. According to our booklet, the trail we wanted to take (the other nearby trail did not go to the top, and the other trails started on the other side of the mountain) would take seven or eight hours. We wanted to be done before eight at night for obvious reasons (especially given our <a href=\"http://129degreeseast.wordpress.com/2011/08/21/jejudo-getting-around-on-the-island/\" target=\"_blank\">terrible experience finding a cab</a> in the evening earlier in the week). However, when woke up, we saw fog and mist and clouds. Not a good sign. Of course, this was the earliest we had been up that week, and maybe things would have still been different if we had thought about that.</p>\n<p>We checked the weather. Rain. What a bummer, yet hey, we can go back to sleep. So we did. A few hours later the sun was in the sky and Ashley woke up, expressing her wish that we had gone hiking, now that the weather was fair. I wanted to go, too, so I said, &#8216;Well, we&#8217;d have to leave <em>right now.&#8217; </em>So we did. We got ready, headed to the convenience store to put some trail snacks in my bag and to get some water, and hailed a cab to take us to the trailhead. The cab driver was friendly, although he kept asking if we wanted to go to \uc601\uc2e4 trail (yeongshil). No. That trailhead was quite far away. The cab fare would have been probably more than twenty-five dollars (equivalent). I think he simply didn&#8217;t know about \ub3c8\ub0b4\ucf54 trail (Donnaeko) because, as the booklet told us, it was only recently opened.</p>\n<p>He dropped us off at what appeared to be a cemetery. There was a sign that pointed the way to the trailhead, and we arrived just after eleven. We walked up, about ten minutes, to where the park office was located. So we started perhaps 11:15. The sign showed us the breakdown of the trail distances, and I saw something that appeared to say that the trail takes about six and a half or seven hours to complete, round-trip. I don&#8217;t know for sure, since one number and its accompanying text was bigger than the other number and its accompanying text.</p>\n<p>Well, I thought, we&#8217;ll be done around six o&#8217;clock, maybe, or a bit after. I had assumed we would take quite a while.</p>\n<p>We started walking. First, it was a paved road that led to an orchard. That orchard led to a wooden staircase that was mostly horizontal. Three or four steps and then twenty feet or so of leveled walking before encountering more stairs. Ashley and I remarked that the booklet said this was one of the easier courses, but we didn&#8217;t know it&#8217;d be this easy! Not a problem with us, though, we just wanted to get to the top.</p>\n<p>But of course, after a few minutes, we left that wooden walkway. We came into a forested area, and the real hike began. The slope was gentle for a while, but eventually we had to climb quite a bit. The scenery was great and the forest was quiet. Once in a while we saw one or two people coming back down the mountain. We smiled to them and said hello (in Korean, although some of them greeted us in English). We moved at a quick pace. We wanted to get up and down the mountain before it was too late and cabs became scarce. Once in a while, we saw a sign telling us how many of the seven kilometers we had hiked and how many were remaining (seven kilometers is approximately 4.35 miles, so the round-trip was just under nine miles).</p>\n<p>After an hour and a half or two, when we reached the four-kilometer point, I noted the time and thought that we were going pretty good, and we&#8217;d make the top before two as long as we didn&#8217;t hit a wall. But, of course, just minutes later was when I hit the wall. I slowed tremendously. Ashley frequently had to slow down or wait for me, even though she is usually the one to take a hike leisurely to enjoy the sights more than the actual traveling. That lasted more than half an hour. I constantly would think, &#8216;Hey, I&#8217;m getting my second wind,&#8217; followed by an attempted increase in energy only to resume crawling two minutes later. Finally, we came out above the trees, where everything was pure gorgeousness. The mountain also reduced its slope a bit, and then we really did have our second wind. We also saw more people. Lots of people, all headed back down the mountain. We remarked on how much this mountain reminded us of <em>Lost.</em>\u00a0After all, that show was filmed in Hawai&#8217;i, which is volcanic just like Jeju. It makes sense that the mountains would seem similar.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_617\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_3128.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-617\" title=\"IMG_3128\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_3128.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">This path was so inspiring and peaceful.</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_613\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_3120.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-613\" title=\"IMG_3120\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_3120.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Some volcanic rocks just chillin&#039; (pun intended) among all that lush greenery. </p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_615\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_3125.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-615\" title=\"IMG_3125\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_3125.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Above the clouds! Yeah!</p></div>\n<p>Anyway, we finally got to a shack, at the end of the seven kilometers, although there was a wooden staircase that lead to the very top of the mountain (so the seven kilometers was simple the main part of the trail, without the added portion). There, at the shack, a man was waiting. He seemed a bit concerned or confused and asked us a question. I thought he asked us where we came from, so we answered, \ub3c8\ub0b4\ucf54 \ucf54\uc2a4 (Donnaeko Course). He told us &#8216;no more climbing&#8217; while saying something about three o&#8217;clock. We were confused, because it was perhaps twenty minutes after two. Some other climbers were sitting on a wooden platform. It seemed that it would take more than forty minutes to go up (it was a pretty big staircase), and so we wouldn&#8217;t have the time to go to the top.</p>\n<p>We were sorely depressed. We wanted to see the crater lake at the top. Even without that lake, we had gone probably 90 or 95% up the mountain. So we sat down for a few minutes just to enjoy the view and compose ourselves before heading back down the trail in defeat. After a few minutes, Ashley heard the man speak to some elderly Koreans, who were enjoying what appeared to be a post-hike picnic. She gathered that he asked them to &#8216;go with&#8217; us when we went back down the mountain. Yes, because we&#8217;re foreigners, which means we&#8217;re incapable of being safe while hiking.</p>\n<p>We didn&#8217;t want to be chaperoned, so we left immediately, perhaps ten minutes after reaching the end of the trail. Sure enough, at one point we looked back up the mountain and saw those elderly Koreans <em>going up the wooden staircase</em>. Ashley quickly deduced that the man asked them to &#8216;go with&#8217; us up to the top. We had been walking for ten minutes at a quick pace already, so going back up wasn&#8217;t an option at this point. So now our mood was twice as bad.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll spare you, though, and tell you quickly that just an hour later we were glad. Hiking uphill is tiring, but hiking downhill is <em>painful, </em>while you&#8217;re already tired. Each step downward on another rock was another jolt on our wearied bones. And there were a lot of steps. Also, going up is a thrill. We&#8217;re going somewhere. Going down is anticlimactic. There isn&#8217;t nearly as much excitement in it. You also have to be careful not to go too fast and thus lose your footing. In the end, we were very tired and our legs were sore. Going up to the very top to see the crater lake would have added easily another hour and a half, or two full hours, to our trip.</p>\n<p>On the way down we also consoled ourselves, before realizing that we weren&#8217;t so depressed after all, by talking about returning to Jeju for a weekend, or even just one night, to hike to the top. Flights to Jeju are really cheap, so it wouldn&#8217;t cost that much to do anyway. But now I don&#8217;t know if we&#8217;ll actually do that. Why?</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the answer. Before we went to Hallasan, I saw a picture of Baekdusan (\ubc31\ub450\uc0b0, the highest mountain on the Korean peninsula, on the border of North Korea and China) and its crater lake, called \ucc9c\uc9c0 or Heaven Lake, shown here:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" title=\"Heaven Lake, Copyright 2005 by Bdpmax\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6d/Baitou_Mountain_Tianchi.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"561\" height=\"405\" /></p>\n<p>Isn&#8217;t that beautiful? So I imagined \ubc31\ub179\ub2f4 (baengnokdam, meaning &#8216;White Deer Lake&#8217;), the crater lake of Hallasan, to be similar. And according to a picture of it I later saw on some promotional flyer for Jeju&#8217;s inclusion in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New7Wonders_of_Nature\" target=\"_blank\">New7Wonders of Nature</a>, it is that pretty. However, that was clearly a promotional photo. Or perhaps an old photo that means to suggest the need to preserve that area. Because after returning to Busan, I saw this photo of the lake:</p>\n<div style=\"width: 651px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"    \" title=\"\ubc31\ub179\ub2f4 Copyright 2008 by Mass Ave 975\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/Halla01.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"641\" height=\"481\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Just not quite as majestic.</p></div>\n<p>It just wasn&#8217;t as pretty as we thought. Of course, in person it might look better. On the other hand, the promotional photo was probably altered to be better than the truth. Who knows for certain? So in the end, we really didn&#8217;t suffer that much loss. We had a good hike. It was beautiful regardless of our expectations and their disappointments. Not to mention, when we got to the end of the trail, to the end of the 14 kilometers, it was just before or right at five o&#8217;clock. Meaning we did the trail in less than six hours! We are excellent hikers.</p>\n<p>[Note: While writing this blog, I found another picture of the lake. Perhaps it is beautiful. It certainly is from this view:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.jejuweekly.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=1778\" target=\"_blank\">link</a>. But don't worry. It doesn't bring back my depression.

A fellow Guest English Teacher, who happens to be a Korean who grew up in New Zealand, invited us. The services are in Korean, but our friend translates for us. We really appreciate the service because it is serious Christianity. The pastor, who speaks fluent English, travels the world (and I mean <em>the world</em>) constantly, which is why he can only speak once a month in Busan. He is the most missionary missionary I&#8217;ve ever met.</p>\n<p>But anyway, that&#8217;s not the point. The point is that last month, out of nowhere, he asked me if Ashley could sing.

It starts after about thirty seconds of the song. Usually we sit in the back because Gloria, our friend, has to translate for us without disrupting other people. So I wasn&#8217;t planning to record it, because the sound would not pick up on my camera (which is <em>not</em>\u00a0a video camera) very well.\u00a0Today, however, there were more foreigners than usual and it&#8217;s Chuseok weekend, a <em>major</em>\u00a0Korean holiday, so less people showed up. Therefore, the pastor spoke in Korean and English, alternating every few sentences, so we sat in the front. After about twenty seconds of the song I realized, &#8216;Hey, I&#8217;m in the front!&#8217; So I quickly started the video.</p>\n", "post_id": 627, "location": false, "date": "09-10-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>(by Brian)</p>\n<p>[Note: Sorry that we haven't updated this in a while.]</p>\n<p>Last weekend, Busan ended its annual firework festival at Gwangalli Beach. This year it lasted nine days, which is much longer than it was in previous years. I guess the story is that seven or eight years ago, Busan lit off some fireworks in celebration of some one-time event. And the people enjoyed the fireworks so much that they decided to shoot them off the next year as well. Now it&#8217;s pretty much there for the heck of it. Also, because it generates revenue from all of the tourism and from the flooding of the restaurants and convenience stories and coffee shops in the area.</p>\n<p>Ashley and I wanted to go the weekend before last, on the Saturday evening when there was a firework competition between four foreign countries. However, it rained that day and we got lazy.</p>\n<p>So we made sure to attend the final night of the festival last Saturday. I showed up early to meet our friends. Ashley would come later and find us. I met up with our friends near the beach and we looked for an ideal place to watch the fireworks. Eventually we gave up on getting seats on top of a restaurant and settled for the beach, which was getting more crowded by the minute.</p>\n<p>The show would start at eight. By the time we sat down on the beach, it was around 4:30. Ashley planned to leave the apartment around that time, so I expected her at the beach around 5:15 or 5:30, depending on the crowd. I called her to let her know where we were located, about how she could probably see us from the sidewalk. She said the subway line was packed going toward the beach and completely bare in the other direction.</p>\n<p>So naturally it took her a bit of time to arrive. Based on how I felt when we left the beach afterward, walking down the street, she must have wondered if everyone was a lemming and she was headed for a cliff.</p>\n<p>And because it took her some time to arrive, the beach became packed to the point that a half-dozen or so police officers were refusing entry for any more people. Some people even tried to tell the officers that they had come from the restroom, that they had a seat already, that they had left their bag on the beach, and so on. After Ashley and I finally spotted each other in the crowd, she tried to get onto the beach. No go. She tried to tell one officer \ub0a8\ud3b8 [nampyeon] which means &#8216;husband&#8217; and to say \ub0a8\ud3b8 \uc788\uc5b4\uc694 [nampyeon isseoyo] which meant, in that context, &#8216;My husband is there.&#8217; The officer proceeded to put the megaphone in her face and yell at her in Korean.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, I was on the other end of a line of officers blocking people from passing through the very narrow walkway between the crowds of people waiting for the show. Some Koreans kept talking to the nearest officer, so while I waited, I thought of what to say and how to say it. The young officer finished speaking to the Koreans, turned to me, and said, &#8216;You can go out, but&#8230;you can&#8217;t come in.&#8217; I tried to tell him, in both languages, that my wife was on the street. He said the same thing again and added that there was no space. I told him that we had space. I pointed to one of the cheap plastic beach blankets my friends that everyone had and said that we had one, so we had space. After all, it seemed that <em>some</em>\u00a0people were getting in somehow, evidenced by the occasional small stream of incoming spectators. But he simply repeated his line.</p>\n<p>So I left. I walked onto the street. My wife had been yelled at by a megaphone in a foreign language, so I wasn&#8217;t going to leave her alone. Once I got to the top of the stairs, I was in shock. The street was filled with people. <em>Filled</em>\u00a0with people, all sitting down. I found Ashley and sat down next to her, and we waited there, dejected, for the show to start.</p>\n<p>For a few seconds, I wondered if I might be arrested. The tension between civilians and officers in that area threatened a chaotic breakout, and nudging and occasional pushing had already begun. Would I get caught up and mistaken as a troublemaker?</p>\n<p>I couldn&#8217;t believe how many people there were. The street was full of people sitting down.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_634\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/img_3250.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-634\" title=\"IMG_3250\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/img_3250.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">It was sprinkling for some time, hence the umbrellas.</p></div>\n<p>I can&#8217;t remember the last time I was in such a crowded area.</p>\n<p>After a few minutes, we heard a Korean woman saying &#8216;\uce58\ud0a8 \uc788\uc5b4\uc694&#8217; [chikin isseoyo] which means &#8216;I have chicken&#8217; or &#8216;There&#8217;s chicken.&#8217; Well, to cheer ourselves up (and because we hadn&#8217;t eaten much), we bought some of that woman&#8217;s chicken.</p>\n<p>We continued to wait for the show while we ate our supper on the street. I didn&#8217;t enjoy being forced onto the street, and I didn&#8217;t enjoy knowing that a Korean yelled point blank at Ashley with a megaphone, but I did enjoy the sense of adventure and unexpectedness that we were experiencing. I thought at the time, &#8216;There is no way just hours ago I would have thought, &#8220;I believe that I will end up eating chicken in the middle of the road tonight.&#8221;&#8216;</p>\n<p>After we finished eating chicken, we still had maybe ninety minutes until showtime. Then that sprinkling that I mentioned earlier became a bit heavier. Generally, Koreans don&#8217;t like to be out in the rain. Enough people left the beach that we saw people begin to attempt to enter the beach. We decided to try for it ourselves. We got up just in time to see the officers leaving. There was no longer a block on beach access. We got in and found our friends. I had texted them to say that I&#8217;d be out on the streets since Ashley couldn&#8217;t get in. One friend suggested I try telling the officers I left my child on the beach or something, but I said that I couldn&#8217;t lie like that. Plus, we had a pretty decent spot on the street. I didn&#8217;t want to risk losing that too. So we were glad to be on the beach.</p>\n<p>Even though we still had about an hour of waiting left.</p>\n<p>In that time, the rain picked up a little bit more, on and off. By the time the show started, I think the density on the beach was about half what it had been. And because the show was forty-five minutes long, and because occasionally the rain picked up, it didn&#8217;t take long for the density to halve again.</p>\n<p>Finally the show started, and at the bottom of this post you can see a brief, cheap video I put sloppily put together.</p>\n<p>After the show ended, we left the beach, but we did not go to the subway station. We knew that would be a waste of time. We just took a walk. Of course, for a few minutes, that walk consisted of slowly pushing forward in a crowd of hundreds who simply moved along the road. We didn&#8217;t know where we were going. We were just going. Eventually a crowd of people pushed through our crowd, and I realized the going had been so slow because two opposing forces were in the middle of a showdown. The crowds broke through and then we were able to actually see the ground ahead of us.</p>\n<p>And boy was it dirty.</p>\n<p>We took a long walk, eventually arriving at the subway station two stops down from the beach. It was crowded, but not abnormally so. But the subway car itself was very packed. We were very glad once we finally got back home.</p>\n<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/DeTZ1kBJ_Zc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span>\n", "post_id": 630, "location": false, "date": "11-04-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>Friday, 11.11.11, was the Dangpyeong Elementary School&#8217;s fall festival.

We passed by a sign one day that read \ub300\ub9bc\ucc38\uce58 (Daerim Chamchi), and we know that \ucc38\uce58 means &#8216;tuna.&#8217; So we took note of it and, on Sunday, we walked down the stairway into the basement of that particular building, where this cozy little restaurant was located.</p>\n<p>Did I say cozy? Maybe claustrophobic would be a better word. When we entered the restaurant, we saw a long, narrow table in a long, narrow room. The table had a space in the middle for the chefs to walk through and prepare food. I wasn&#8217;t quite prepared for such an intimate setting, but we had entered already, and there were plenty of seats. Only three other patrons dined there, leaving probably twenty or so extra seats empty. As foreigners in a mostly empty establishment sitting right across the counter from the chef, we would be scrutinized.</p>\n<p>I heard the customers across the table from us say \uc678\uad6d\uc778 on occasion, meaning &#8216;foreigner.&#8217; Ashley says one guy even pointed at us while speaking. I think they laughed at our chopsticks skills. Or Ashley&#8217;s maybe: I&#8217;m quite proficient with chopsticks. I&#8217;m not bragging. I&#8217;m repeating the compliments of nearly every co-worker I&#8217;ve eaten lunch with. (Okay, I&#8217;m bragging.)</p>\n<p>Another chef at the restaurant must have thought our skills were lacking, though, because after a few minutes he took away our metal chopsticks (the kind of chopsticks Koreans use) and gave us some wooden chopsticks (which are more familiar to most people and, because they have more texture, are easier for some people to use). I prefer the metal ones but I wasn&#8217;t going to argue.</p>\n<p>You can be at ease, though. I purposely related all of the negative and minor details first, perhaps slightly inflating them in the process.</p>\n<p>When we first sat down, the chef gave us the menu and asked if we spoke any Korean. I replied \uc870\uae08\ub9cc, which means &#8216;only a little.&#8217; It turns out that his English is very good, though, and throughout the meal he would converse with us. He was very friendly and for that reason alone, I want to return to that establishment just so that he will know that we enjoyed our previous visit.</p>\n<p>Yet there&#8217;s another reason. I also want to return because the food was awesome. As we looked at the menu, and as I tried to quickly read the Korean and decipher the meanings, the chef simplified things for us by telling us a few things about the main page. Next to one item was the price 20,000 won per person (about $17.50), next to another was 25,000, and then 35,000, and I think two more prices that reached 70 or 80 thousand won. He explained that each increase in cost meant an increase in the cuts of tuna you can get. So the real prime stuff must have been at that 80,000 won price. All the prices seem kind of expensive, but any kind of sushi or sashimi is, especially good stuff such as tuna. We also gave ourselves a weekly budget starting a few months ago, so if we decide on one day to treat ourselves, we simply cut back for the rest of the week.</p>\n<p>The chef said something about getting full and telling him to stop. I did not want to assume, because of the language barrier, that he meant this was an all-you-can-eat deal. So I intended to eat until I noticed him looking at our bill and considering adding another tally mark to it.</p>\n<p>He never did though. When Ashley got full and said so, I thought I&#8217;d play it safe and let that be it. The chef remarked, &#8216;Most of our guests eat lots. You don&#8217;t want any more?&#8217; Well, I did want more, and I don&#8217;t like lying.</p>\n<p>So I got more.</p>\n<p>Lots more.</p>\n<p>We did, after all, already have the bill (in Korea, you usually get it right away, which is nice). No one had bothered to even look at it. Also, I didn&#8217;t mean to eat so much. Whenever the board would be low on pieces of tuna, the chef would take the bin out from the cooler and cut a few more strips.</p>\n<p>We didn&#8217;t only eat tuna, of course. Right away we were served our own bowls of salad, soup, and rice porridge, and on the board where the tuna would be placed were also some vegetables, sushi roll pieces, and some aged kimchi. All of which were replenished as needed. Throughout the meal, the hostess would bring out other dishes, such as such tasty vegetable dish or a hot bowl of steamed egg custard (it&#8217;s good).</p>\n<p>I think we actually got a special treatment. I think that our menu choice allotted four different cuts of tuna, but I&#8217;m pretty sure we had more like seven. He would tell us which part it was, too, and suggest which sauce would go best with it (and, of course, he was right). Sometimes the soy sauce mixed with wasabi, sometimes the garlic oil. At one point, he got out a torch and used it on a few pieces of tuna. Then he assembled for each of us a treat with those torched pieces on a piece of roasted seaweed with a few well-chosen vegetables. It tasted like artwork.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m sure if I ate as much sashimi at SoHo (the place in Mishawaka where I would get sushi or sashimi back in America), I would spend probably 50 or 60 bucks for myself alone, probably more. One piece of tuna there would probably be three or four dollars, and seven dollars for the prime cuts. And although the pieces we ate at Daerim were smaller, I ate a good 25 or 30 pieces. At least. That&#8217;s not to mention the other food brought out to us periodically.</p>\n<p>So how much did we spend? Our food cost 50,000 won, or about $43 for the both of us. The only times I ever got full at SoHo were from buying a regular dish and having just a few pieces of sushi on the side. This time I got full primarily on sushi.</p>\n<p>Yeah, we&#8217;re going back someday.</p>\n", "post_id": 682, "location": false, "date": "11-22-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>Sometimes, Ashley and I go to the movie theater. We watch American movies, of course, which have Korean subtitles for the mostly-Korean audience. At any given time, I think a theater might show an average of three different English-language films. Take out the ones we absolutely don&#8217;t want to see (such as the children&#8217;s films and recent releases such as <em>Breaking Dawn</em>), and we end up watching most of these movies pretty quick.</p>\n<p>We also would like to see some Korean movies. But we know that our Korean skills are not even high enough to watch a half-hour children&#8217;s show, so the only way it would be possible would be to see a movie with subtitles. Most people in Korea speak Korean, so it makes sense for movies not to have English subtitles.</p>\n<p>Yet one day, while browsing talktomeinkorean.com, I saw that some theaters in Seoul and Busan have foreign subtitles. Could it really be so? I Googled it and found a page on the Official Site of Korean Tourism. It claimed two theaters in Busan that had foreign subtitles for select films. One theater includes Japanese subtitles and the other includes English.</p>\n<p>Yes! We would be able to watch a Korean movie and perhaps pick up on some language use. Well, we went to that theater, in Centum City (which is a shopping district in Busan that includes the world&#8217;s largest department store, twenty feet next to another large department store) and could not see any markings that indicated which films had subtitles. We decided just to watch an English-language movie, <em>The Help</em>, and to come back some other day.</p>\n<p>Well, today was that day. I made my plan and we went to Centum City again. This was my plan: to ask the ticket clerk \uc601\uc5b4 \uc790\ub9c9 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\uae4c? It means, &#8216;Are there English subtitles?&#8217; I guess I expected her to say, \ub124 (yes) and then show me a list of which movies had subtitles. Instead, she spoke in rapid Korean. I couldn&#8217;t catch a word of it. I guess that&#8217;s what I get. If I speak a fluent sentence, I guess I should expect such a fluent response.</p>\n<p>I tried again. She didn&#8217;t understand what I meant. She asked me for the title of the movie I wanted to see. I didn&#8217;t know that. We just wanted to watch <em>any</em>\u00a0Korean movie that we could. So I asked, \uc601\uc5b4 \uc790\ub9c9 \uc788\ub294 \uc601\ud654? which is an incomplete sentence (I hadn&#8217;t planned this one like the other) roughly meaning, &#8216;Movie having English subtitles?&#8217; or &#8216;Movies that contain English subtitles?&#8217; She got excited and got a book of movie posters. I thought it would be a reference to which films contained subtitles, but then she opened the book and pointed at a movie we had already seen. An English-language movie, I mean. We said no, so she pointed to another. Saw it. Another. Didn&#8217;t see it but don&#8217;t want to. Finally I apologized to her and we left.</p>\n<p>Well, we hadn&#8217;t eaten anything yet for that day so we decided to get some food. But I wanted to try one last time. I realized that my second Korean sentence wasn&#8217;t very good, and I had an idea to make it better. I went back and grabbed the notebook in my bag. I wrote a few sentences, which I would use as backup if I stumbled over my Korean.</p>\n<p>I wrote \uc778\ud130\ub137\uc740 &#8220;\uc774 \uc601\ud654\uc9d1\uc740 \uc601\uc5b4 \uc790\ub9c9 \uc788\ub294 \ud55c\uad6d \uc601\ud654\uac00 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4&#8221; \ub77c\uace0 \ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc601\uc5b4 \uc790\ub9c9\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4 \uc601\ud654\uac00 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\uae4c? \ub9cc\uc57d \uadf8\uac00 \uc788\uc73c\uba74, \uc6b0\ub9ac \ubcf4\uace0 \uc2f6\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.</p>\n<p>Rough translation (or the good English equivalent of my poor Korean): The Internet said this movie house has Korean movies with English subtitles. Are there Korean language movies with English subtitles? If there are, we want to see them.</p>\n<p>I said I would use the writing as a backup, right? Haha. Well, I got to the desk, a different employee this time, and simply held up the notebook. I guess my voice caught or I forgot what to say or&#8230;well, you know.</p>\n<p>The woman looked at it for a few seconds in confusion (probably because, hey, what&#8217;s this foreigner doing shoving a notebook in my face?) and then shook her head apologetically and said no, they don&#8217;t have the subtitles.</p>\n<p>Okay. I thanked her and walked away. Defeated. I wondered if I had remembered the theater correctly. But no. I got home and checked. <a title=\"Movie Theaters Offering Foreign Subtitles\" href=\"http://visitkorea.or.kr/ena/HA/HA_EN_7_2_6_0.jsp\" target=\"_blank\">That site</a> clearly shows the correct theater (it&#8217;s at the very bottom).</p>\n<p>Well, I guess we&#8217;ll just have to stick with English-language movies.

In the summer, we shared nine, including the weekends.</p>\n<p>The vacation is still in progress: Ashley returns to work on February 1 and I the day following. But most of it has been accomplished. Here&#8217;s what was up:</p>\n<p>First, we did a whole lot of nothing. We stayed home and relaxed with a whole lot of nothing. But on Sunday morning, we went to Gimhae Airport and flew down to Jeju Island. Yeah, we went there already, but this time we visited some friends from Andrews University. We spend three days hanging out with Chris and Becka in Seogwipo, the city that covers the south half of the island. We had quite some fun, although we were surprised by the weather in Jeju. The island is considered the &#8220;Hawaii of Korea,&#8221; but apparently that&#8217;s only acceptable to say in the summer. Almost everything was just as green as it had been, but the temperature was colder, and the wind was biting. I was glad I brought my scarf.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_729\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/img_3488.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-729\" title=\"IMG_3488\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/img_3488.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">So was Chris.</p></div>\n<p>In fact, it snowed a bit in Seogwipo. Only a bit, though, but in Jeju City (the north half of the island), it snowed a lot, as we learned on our slow bus ride to the airport on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>In the background of that photo above is the Yakcheonsa Temple (\uc57d\ucc9c\uc0ac) we visited briefly on Monday. Chris and Becka thought that it would be all decorated with lanterns and other ornamentation for the Lunar New Year. However, there was only disappointment. They realized that perhaps the lanterns only come out for Buddha&#8217;s Birthday. They had also expected the holiday to be a big deal, as it is in China, with parades and parties and public celebrations galore. But it seems that most of Korea&#8217;s biggest holidays simply involve people visiting their eldest relatives and having a quiet celebration at home.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_739\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/img_3472.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-739\" title=\"IMG_3472\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/img_3472.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Making this place sparsely populated.</p></div>\n<p>We also took walks along the coast of Jeju, near some waterfalls, and we revisited Cheonjiyeon Falls (\ucc9c\uc9c0\uc5f0 \ud3ed\ud3ec).</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_740\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/img_3500.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-740\" title=\"IMG_3500\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/img_3500.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Chris and Becka at Cheonjiyeon Falls</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_741\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/img_3505.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-741\" title=\"IMG_3505\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/img_3505.jpg?w=500&#038;h=666\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"666\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Brian and Ashley at Cheonjiyeon Falls</p></div>\n<p>After we went to Cheonjiyeon, we went to the coolest cafe I&#8217;d ever been to. It was a little wooden cabin house with a couple of fireplaces. There was one room where you could order drinks and snacks. The rest was one big room in the cabin with booths and partial walls added to make places for friends and families to gather. The atmosphere was very cozy, friendly, and &#8220;local.&#8221; We also ordered some sweet potatoes that were roasted in the fireplace, because Ashley loves sweet potatoes. Chris got some corn on the cob, but we&#8217;ve determined that Korea and corn have an odd relationship. I&#8217;ll leave it at that. I wish I had known about that place last time we were in Jeju, even though we went <em>right by it</em>. It&#8217;s hidden among trees and plants that grow all around it. We had seen it before, but only the part of it where Jeju oranges were sold at what appeared then simply to be a roadside stand.</p>\n<p>Among other activities were visiting a noraebang (\ub178\ub798\ubc29) which literally means &#8220;singing room,&#8221; and having dinner at \ud589\ubcf5\ud55c \ucc28\uc2e4 (which is also called, and literally means, Happy Tea Room). A noraebang is similar to karaoke at a bar, except you and your friends get a room to yourselves. You don&#8217;t have to sing in front of any strangers. Ashley sang Radiohead&#8217;s &#8220;Creep,&#8221; which everyone loved hearing when she sang it on Rock Band back home.\u00a0I sang a few Korean songs (or tried to at least). Chris got a video of me singing <a title=\"\uadf8\ub807\uace0 \uadf8\ub7f0 \uc0ac\uc774 Music Video\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixfXGcuINx4\" target=\"_blank\">\uadf8\ub807\uace0 \uadf8\ub7f0 \uc0ac\uc774 by \uc7a5\uae30\ud558\uc640 \uc5bc\uad74\ub4e4</a>. My best performance was on another song, though, but I don&#8217;t think he got a video of it. If he posts the video, I&#8217;ll add it to this page or make a new post for it.</p>\n<p>And the Happy Tea Room is a small restaurant in the upstairs of some woman&#8217;s home. Although it&#8217;s called the Happy Tea Room, they serve full meals. We all ate some kind of soup that had green pieces of ddeok (\ub5a1, or rice cake). It was quite delicious. We met a couple of Chris and Becka&#8217;s friends there. Despite there being six people, apparently most of them don&#8217;t care much for kimchi. At one point I realized I had eaten most of the kimchi (it was especially good kimchi). I expressed my guilt of hogging all of the kimchi, but everyone assured me that I should eat it all myself. No problemo.</p>\n<p>Other than that, we didn&#8217;t do too much. We just relaxed and hung out with our friends. It was cool to see them. They kept remarking how strange and awesome it was to see people from their former lives, and university no less. We had experienced it when we met Kristina, and when we had met Dr. Closser and Dr. Greig, but it had been a while since those visits. It was nice to see people from the past, to speak with them about our similar and differing experiences, and to have prolonged exposure to people who spoke English.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, somehow Ashley injured her foot during our last full day in Jeju. Sometime on Tuesday, her foot suddenly started hurting with every step. I suspect that it was because of all the walking we did. We hoped that her foot would feel better the next day, but that was not the case. On Wednesday morning, we left Jeju, and Ashley&#8217;s foot hurt just as much as it did the day before. Still, she toughed it out and we got on the plane to Seoul, where we planned to stay for two nights and relax. We had very little plans in Seoul, other than to meet Ashley&#8217;s former employer, from when she worked as a webcam tutor, and with Ashley&#8217;s foot injured, we doubted that we would add much to those plans. Which was okay, because&#8230;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_730\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/img_3509.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-730\" title=\"IMG_3509\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/img_3509.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">...this was our hotel room...</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_731\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/img_3510.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-731\" title=\"IMG_3510\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/img_3510.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">...and this was the jacuzzi/shower that came with our hotel room, next to the heated-seat toilet...</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_734\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/img_3518.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-734\" title=\"IMG_3518\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/img_3518.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">...and here are the computers which were in our room...</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_735\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/img_3519.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-735\" title=\"IMG_3519\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/img_3519.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">...one of which had an input setting on this big screen TV in front of the bed.</p></div>\n<p>That computer had a bunch of DVDs saved to it, so there were lots of movies to watch. And did I mention that the TV had surround sound? Ashley kept saying it was the coolest hotel she&#8217;d ever been in. It was pretty cheap, too.</p>\n<p>With Ashley&#8217;s injured foot, we didn&#8217;t go far for supper that night. Before that, I stopped by a pharmacy to buy her an elastic bandage, first learning the word for &#8220;elastic bandage&#8221; in Korean (it&#8217;s \ud0c4\uc131 \ubd95\ub300 in case you&#8217;re interested) so that I could ask the pharmacist &#8220;\ud0c4\uc131 \ubd95\ub300 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\uae4c?&#8221; (&#8220;Do you have elastic bandages?&#8221;) After she wrapped her foot, we walked down the street and found a tuna restaurant. It was a bit pricier than we expected, but it was delicious.</p>\n<p>The next day we met David, Ashley&#8217;s former supervisor, who had also been trying to help us find jobs in Korea. He turned out to be a very friendly guy. I liked him, and not only because he bought us tea, lunch, and snacks. We went to a touristy area that&#8217;s popular with foreigners called Insadong, and one of the first things we stopped at was a snack cart, where David said, Oh, free samples. He gave us each a piece, and then the vendor encouraged us to try all of the flavors. David asked us if we liked it, so when we said yes, he bought us a bag. He wanted to take us to a tea house, but it wasn&#8217;t open yet, so we walked around and looked at various shops. Some of the shops allowed customers to make their own goods. You could make your own cake, or take a simple mirror and add jewels or beads or paint to it, or make a candle, and so on. We didn&#8217;t do any of these things, but it was neat to look at.</p>\n<p>Then we went back to the tea house, which was now open. He and I both tried the ginger tea (he said he always gets jujubee tea, but that he should try something new). It&#8217;s now my favorite tea (or at least <em>that</em>\u00a0ginger tea is my favorite; I suspect if I try to buy it elsewhere, it would highly disappoint me). Then we went to lunch, where all three of us were surprised and glad at the food. There were <em>many</em>\u00a0side dishes with our meal, and all of them were very tasty.</p>\n<p>David had printed out some information for the Seoul City Tour bus, which would have let us get off at any of 18 spots, see a sight, and wait for another bus to come every half hour to continue the tour. Some of the stops were just hotels, for various tourists, and we only saw a few items we wanted to see that we hadn&#8217;t. With Ashley&#8217;s injured foot, though, we also took the bus anyway as a way to see the city without having to walk too much. In the end, though, we decided just to take the cable car up Namsan to see the Seoul Tower. When we visited Dr. Closser and Dr. Greig, it was too late at night to get tickets to go into the tower, but this time we saw the tower. We also saw some traditional Korean performances at the top of Namsan, and we ate some of the best hamburgers I&#8217;ve eaten in this country.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_742\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/img_3537.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-742 \" title=\"IMG_3537\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/img_3537.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ashley looks at the Seoul sprawl.</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_746\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/img_3538.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-746\" title=\"IMG_3538\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/img_3538.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A bit hazy out that day, I guess.</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_743\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/img_3542.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-743\" title=\"IMG_3542\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/img_3542.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">I think most days in Seoul might be like that.</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_744\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/img_3557.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-744\" title=\"IMG_3557\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/img_3557.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">In front of the sun, shining on the river.

The following morning would have us check out and get on the Mugunghwa, the cheapest (and slowest) train to Busan. We chose it for its scenic advantages over the faster KTX, although I think the scenery was much better last time we rode the Mugunghwa, when the scenery was in full green.</p>\n<p>And now we&#8217;re back in our apartment. We have a few days of vacation left, but they will, I hope, be spent more productively, taking advantage of not being at work during business hours. We have some errands to attend to, including applying for an extension on our visas, because our one-year contracts started about 10 days after we entered the country on one-year visas.</p>\n<p>And I hope that Ashley&#8217;s foot is fully healed this weekend as well.

We will do business there and make a profit.&#8221; How do you know what your life will be like tomorrow?

On February 14, 2011, we said, &#8220;Tomorrow we are going on a plane to a certain city and will stay there a year. We will teach there and earn a living.&#8221; And now we say, &#8220;What does the Lord want us to do: this or that?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Our contracts end on February 25. It&#8217;s a Saturday. As of that date, we will no longer be employed by the Busan Metropolitan City Office of Education (BMCOE). That admission was long in the making. Just months ago, we expected to stay at our schools and work at least one more year. In fact, we had even decided to stay at least three, and possibly four, additional years. It was our four-year plan.</p>\n<p>Then December came. December is the month when people generally find out from their schools if they will be renewed. We had a stressful time. We heard from our colleagues on Facebook, fellow foreign teachers of English in Korea, that the BMCOE needed certain documents by a certain date. These documents included a health check, which would take a few business days to process. We were approaching the date without a word from our schools. Finally we asked our schools to give us a few hours off from work to go get our health checks processed, even though they had said nothing regarding these things. So I went to get my health check, and Ashley was to go the next day.</p>\n<p>However, that next day, Ashley found out from her school that she would not be rehired next year. It turned out that she was doomed from the beginning, from the moment she was placed with a school that prefers to employ a fresh teacher each year.</p>\n<p>We spent some time in deep thought, considering the options, which at the time appeared to be 1) go home and hope the job market wasn&#8217;t as bad as people were saying it was; 2) stay in Busan and hope Ashley finds a job; 3) stay in Busan while Ashley becomes a housewife, because then at least one of us would have a job. We didn&#8217;t like option 3 much, and option 2 seemed difficult, because although there are many jobs in Korea, it would be difficult for us to find her one that fit with our needs. Sure, hagwons are everywhere in Korea, and therefore the job market is generous. But hagwons are after-school educational institutions. Most of them have hours until nine or ten in the evening, which is a problem for us regarding Fridays. Still, we considered the possibility; some hagwons have morning hours, and some hagwons teach adults, which would be even more in line with Ashley&#8217;s abilities and interests.</p>\n<p>Yet there was still the question of my employment. Was I to be rehired? I had begun to doubt. Ashley&#8217;s co-teacher had called my co-teacher to ask if I had been renewed, but my school said that they didn&#8217;t know. That&#8217;s enough to lower a man&#8217;s confidence. Finally, though, my school gave me a decision. I was called down to my co-teacher&#8217;s office, where she told me, &#8220;Congratulations, you passed the evaluation.&#8221; I told her that I didn&#8217;t know, though, if I could accept the renewal, and I explained the situation.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I talked with Ashley&#8217;s school and they said that if you are rehired then they will change her points.&#8221;</p>\n<p>What? Really? This was great news if it were true. In either case, my co-teacher said I needed to decide to turn in the documents for renewal by the next day. I went back to my office and contacted Ashley, telling her the great news. Later, my co-teacher came and said, &#8220;I called Ashley&#8217;s school and they are not sure if they will change her points. So please consider that when you make your decision.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Heartbreak. Utter heartbreak and anger. What is up with Ashley&#8217;s school? Maybe there was something lost in translation. Maybe my co-teacher misunderstood Ashley&#8217;s co-teacher, and then that misunderstanding was translated. It could happen in English alone. This was in English\u00a0<em>and</em>\u00a0Korean, so there you go.</p>\n<p>The next day I asked my co-teacher if Ashley&#8217;s school had decided for certain whether they would hire her. &#8220;No.&#8221; Then I brought up the possibility of submitting my documents and then, if Ashley failed to find a job, of refusing to sign the contract. She said it was alright. Then she asked me to sign the contract. She explained, when I showed apprehension, that it was a preliminary contract. It didn&#8217;t even have all the details filled in yet. She also explained that my school would allow me to back out of my contract a few weeks before the school year would start if Ashley couldn&#8217;t find a job.</p>\n<p>They were certainly being very generous, and I did note that the contract itself allows employees to give a 60-day notice if necessary. If push came to shove, I could work for two months and then leave, or even fill out a six-month period.</p>\n<p>Well, a few days later, my co-teacher called me to her office. When I saw her, she just looked up from her computer at me. Normally she would say \uc548\ub155! (Hi!), so I started to wonder if something was bothering her. She told me to sit and asked if I wanted some tea. She was very quiet. Finally she sat down and said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how to tell you this, but&#8230;&#8221;</p>\n<p>My evaluation had been 81. The minimum to renew was 80. I had received a perfect score on attitude, but I had missed some points on teaching and student reaction. The BMCOE, probably in an effort to meet a reduced budget, decided to cut high school foreign teachers by raising the minimum evaluation score to 85.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Oh, okay,&#8221; I said. I explained that it was quite alright, because it made decision-making easier for Ashley and me. And in truth I was indeed very calm. My co-teacher was more upset, it seemed, than me. She had been afraid how I would take the news, but I assured her that it was quite alright. And it was. I had been quite depressed earlier at the thought of leaving my school, just when more of the shier students began to be less shy around me, just when I started to form closer relationships with some of my co-workers, just when many students had been telling me, &#8220;We love you. Our school loves you.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But I think I moved on from that. I&#8217;ll still miss my students and co-workers, but it no longer feels like the end of the world.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>The Daejeon Decision</strong></p>\n<p>So we couldn&#8217;t stay in Busan unless we got university positions or found a Sabbath-friendly hagwon to work at. Ashley had remained in contact with her former supervisor, from when she worked as a webcam tutor for elementary and middle school students in Korea. He began looking into jobs for us around Seoul, where he works, and throughout Korea. He passed our resumes on to various schools, and one school in Daejeon seemed very promising: \ub300\uc804\uc0bc\uc721\ucd08\ub4f1\ud559\uad50 (Daejeon Sahmyook Elementary School). It&#8217;s an English immersion school, meaning that the students learn many of their subjects\u2014math, science, language arts, and geography\u2014in English from foreign teachers. It&#8217;s also a school run by Seventh-day Adventists, meaning that there would definitely be no trouble with keeping the Sabbath.</p>\n<p>The news came at a time when we were just starting to give up, and it seemed like the answer to a prayer. When Ashley spoke with her former supervisor, David, he said that the school was very keen on hiring us. And the principal wanted to meet us on a Sabbath to assess our character. Scary, okay, and at first I didn&#8217;t like the idea of going to Daejeon on Sabbath, but I later reasoned, They want us to go to church with them and meet them; it&#8217;s not an interview.</p>\n<p>That thought seemed confirmed when we received a call from the school. A Korean woman then interviewed us, without warning, over the phone. She seemed very excited at our interest in their school, as they have seventeen foreign teachers, and only one of them is Adventist. I asked her if the others were at least Christian, and she said no. I was quite surprised. Usually Adventist institutions are quite selective in that regard.</p>\n<p>David also told us that the school was worried that we would change our minds once we saw the school. So they really seemed to want to hire us, even though we don&#8217;t have experience teaching subjects other than English and I have no elementary education experience. Our Adventist background seemed to be working in our favor.</p>\n<p>Our faith also seemed to be in our favor, in a way. We said to each other that despite our lack of experience, if God wanted us to have this job, He would give us the ability, if not immediately then, at least, over time. We also decided that if we were not offered the job, then it would definitely be God&#8217;s choice. We felt good about either outcome.</p>\n<p>The interview had already taken place and they still wanted us to go meet them, so things seemed quite positive. So we went to Daejeon, and we met the staff of the school. One staff member, Stephen, showed us around the school before church started. Then we went to church, and then, finally, we went to the school cafeteria to eat lunch with everyone. A few teachers who sat with us started to ask us some questions. It seemed quite alright at first, like mere conversation. &#8220;Oh, how long have you been in Korea?&#8221;, &#8220;Where are you from?&#8221; and so on. The principal came, too, and he asked us some questions. Eventually they called some other teachers over and we realized, as the questions turned into, &#8220;What are your strengths as a teacher?&#8221; that this was an interview.</p>\n<p>Even when lunch was over, the principal made a prayer to &#8220;end the interview.&#8221; Then Stephen took us back to the train station. Wow, I thought, just wow. Ashley told me later that they were surprised that we showed up for church, that they only expected to meet us afterward. Which means that they had only wanted us to come to interview us. Which they had already done on the phone. I wondered if they had even spoken with the woman who called us.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I started to wonder if we would get hired. On one hand, the principal had showed concern over my lack of smiling during the sermon. (In Korea, there&#8217;s a prejudice for foreigners who smile. They think that foreigners who don&#8217;t smile 24/7 won&#8217;t win the students&#8217; trust or affection, which isn&#8217;t quite true. My students love me, and I don&#8217;t smile 24/7. I also learned to smile more as time went on. In any case, when he expressed this concern, I mentioned it was because I was concentrating on listening to the sermon, which was in Korean, and translating what little of it I could. I didn&#8217;t mention that Stephen was also translating it, but only parts of it that he was able to, so that I had to listen to him once every third or fourth sentence that he would translate. I said that I could smile more often. I even smiled quite a bit during lunch and while Stephen was showing us the school.) On the other hand, the principal&#8217;s prayer (which was translated by one of the English teachers) ended with something like, &#8220;and I hope we get to work together.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As it turns out, by &#8220;we&#8221; he must have meant &#8220;Ashley and our school.&#8221; We got news a few days later that they wanted to hire Ashley but not me. David said that Stephen argued vehemently in our favor, but that some other teacher didn&#8217;t like me. The school thought I was too nervous (which I didn&#8217;t really feel nervous at all, but I guess not smiling equals afraid). In any case, Ashley told them that she wouldn&#8217;t accept their offer. Daejeon is smaller than Busan. If it seemed difficult for us to have me working in Busan and hope Ashley could find a job, the chances were to be much slimmer in Daejeon. In any case, we accepted this news as God&#8217;s will, although we were, I admit, quite sad the day we found out the news. The details of our situation, some of which are not included in this post because of length (and the inability to translate certain thoughts into words without a great effort that I wish at the moment not to expend), convinced us that the Daejeon decision would be God&#8217;s decision for us regarding employment in Korea this year (after all, if He had wanted us to stay, we would have been hired; I suppose it&#8217;s also still possible that we get a job here, and one given by God&#8217;s will, because nothing is impossible, but we must first visit our families).</p>\n<p>While all of this was happening, we were trying to figure out our plan of action regarding coming to America. If we had landed the job, we would have visited for about two weeks in the States during our vacation, which is going on right now. If not, we would simply wait until the end of our contracts to see our families. This interview happened just a bit over a week before our vacation started, so we were looking at some very last-minute flight possibilities. As it turned out, we didn&#8217;t need those flights after all.</p>\n<p>So we spent our vacation as mentioned in the previous post, and within a few days of February 25, we&#8217;ll be, Lord willing, on a plane to LAX.</p>\n<p>See you soon.</p>\n<p>PS: One of the teachers at my school, who talks to me frequently in order to practice her English skills, told me that this year, unlike other years, the student evaluations for teachers were unusually low, that it seemed that a considerable number of students simply rated all the teachers low. She said, &#8220;My score is low. My heart is broken.&#8221; So I wonder if, had that not happened, I would have had a better score. Not that it matters, but I was quite interested to learn this detail a few weeks ago.</p>\n", "post_id": 750, "location": false, "date": "01-31-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p><em>A few years ago I heard a joke that I really appreciate.

Where the rabbi said, &#8220;I told you I didn&#8217;t know.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Two weeks ago, I <a title=\"A Tale of Two Cities\" href=\"http://129degreeseast.wordpress.com/2012/01/31/a-tale-of-two-cities/\" target=\"_blank\">wrote about the events</a> that ultimately led us to the moment wherein we had to realize that we would be going back home a little earlier than we had expected. I must eat my words. Ashley and I will continue to work in Korea.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;d been quite calm. \u00a0In my previous post, I mentioned that we were trying to see what happened as God&#8217;s will, or, in the least, I should add, that even if your own plans don&#8217;t happen, life goes on and in the end, none of it will matter by comparison.</p>\n<p>That being said, on Friday, I said goodbye to my students and co-workers. Korean teachers change schools every four or five years, so on Friday, a half-day of school, all of the teachers who are leaving appeared on stage in the school&#8217;s auditorium so that they could all bow to the students and the students could cheer them on for their new schools. As an exiting teacher, I was included in that ceremony. Afterward, teachers packed things up and went home. There is no more school until March 2, when the new school year begins, but foreign teachers usually have to stay. Thus, I would be coming back to school, but my students and co-workers would not.*</p>\n<p>And I&#8217;ll admit it. Once I got back to my apartment I broke down. I was excited to come home, to see my family and friends, to be in my own country, but I just said goodbye to one of the most significant years of my life (I&#8217;m not insulting my other years at all or diminishing the importance of them and the people who populated them; I merely mean that I changed a lot in Korea, and even without that, I&#8217;d say spending a year on the other side of the globe after living for nearly 25 years in one little pinpoint of it is rather significant).</p>\n<p>Shortly thereafter, I received a message from Ashley. She wanted us to pray for a place to live (which would mean finding jobs as well), and over the days she had been stressing the importance of praying for jobs themselves (not just any jobs, as those are everywhere in Korea, but a workplace where we would be needed, and appreciated). I think lately that we&#8217;ve learned a bit more about what trusting God means, and how to live without anxiety, as Jesus commands (it&#8217;s still a struggle, of course, but I have more hope these days). Nonetheless, we didn&#8217;t know what we&#8217;d be doing once we returned to America. We had plans for a few interviews and applications, but you never know how long that might last. Some people live that life for months or even years. I wanted to go home and relax and enjoy my time with people. I didn&#8217;t want to have to go home and then look for a job. I didn&#8217;t know which scenario would have been worse: to get home and be jobless for several months or to get home and land a job that would require immediate relocation, thus preventing me from spending much time with my family. This is not even to mention the thought that finally occurred to me a few weeks ago: what about health insurance? We have it now, but once we go return to America&#8230;.</p>\n<p>So I prayed. I can&#8217;t remember what I said, but I do feel that I put more faith into it than many other prayers. It&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve been learning lately. Sometimes, an effective prayer almost feels like a gamble, except one where the entire roulette wheel is full of one number. Sometimes, you know it&#8217;s not your number, and then the prayer almost feels meaningless, but sometimes&#8230;sometimes it&#8217;s your number. But I can&#8217;t boast. Perhaps only in hindsight I feel like I had faith then. Perhaps I wasn&#8217;t faithful, but God was.</p>\n<p>So we both prayed, I at home and she at work. Perhaps one hour later, or even less, Ashley sent me a message. David, her supervisor from her days as an online English tutor for Korean students, told her that a school was interested in potentially hiring us.</p>\n<p>At first, to be honest, we were kind of upset. We had decided to come home. We had even purchased our plane tickets. And, in fact, we had even turned down a last-minute interview request that he had mentioned a couple of weeks ago, so he knew (or should have known) that we didn&#8217;t want to hear any of it. (We turned down the interview because, for one, Ashley&#8217;s foot was in quite some pain. It&#8217;s better now, but also at that time, we were on a two-day trip to Seoul and had already passed our window for visiting America. If we started another school year, we wouldn&#8217;t get to visit our families first, and we really needed to do that.)</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, our job-seeker profiles were adrift in cyberspace and David continued to field the calls, never presuming that we were not interested, whatever Ashley told him. This time, Ashley told him that we had already purchased tickets and that we weren&#8217;t interested. A few minutes later he sent a text, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry that I did it without your permission, but I gave your number to the vice principal.&#8221;</p>\n<p>What?!</p>\n<p>So the school called her. It was a school that had had a vacancy for one teacher before, but due to a sudden occurrence, another teacher had to leave, so the school now needed two teachers. Ashley told them right away that we had already booked our tickets and planned on going home.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Oh, well that&#8217;s okay. We&#8217;re flexible. You can start at the end of March.&#8221;</p>\n<p>What?!</p>\n<p>The school is \uc11c\ud574\uc0bc\uc721\ucd08\ub4f1\ud559\uad50 (Seohae Sahmyook Elementary School; Seohae means &#8220;western sea&#8221; and is the Korean name for the Yellow Sea), so it&#8217;s run by Adventists, just as the school in Daejeon is. The person who called Ashley this time, though, was not an English-fluent Korean. He was Canadian, and he&#8217;s the head English teacher. He understood our desire to go home first and supported it, having himself benefited from the same process.</p>\n<p>So Ashley and I discussed it together and agreed to visit the school and the town on Sunday, just to check it out and see. Mr. Anderson told us that if we liked it, he would inform the vice-principal and principal, and they would decide if they would be willing to accommodate our need to go home. He told us to stand our ground if the vice-principal, who would also meet us, asked us to cancel our tickets and allow the school to reimburse us.</p>\n<p>We visited the town, which is quite small. It takes over three hours on two trains to get there, and there are only a handful of buildings with more than two or three stories.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_766\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/img_3585.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-766\" title=\"IMG_3585\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/img_3585.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Reminds me of home.</p></div>\n<p>It&#8217;s bigger than that, of course, and the schools are <em>very</em>\u00a0nice. That was just a photo I took quickly before we got on the train to go back to Busan. Sometimes, while riding the train, I see little farming communities with houses and stores spread far apart, and I was afraid Gwangcheon would be like that. As it turns out, everything is comfortably spaced, and the train station is even just 10 or 15 minutes by foot from the apartment, so it&#8217;s not too much of a burden to hop on the train and pay two bucks to go into the city.</p>\n<p>The school was very nice. Mr. Anderson and his wife (who is Korean) and daughter (of whom I am jealous, as she&#8217;s bilingual) showed us around and explained a few things. They even showed us the apartment we&#8217;d be staying in if we got the job. It&#8217;s a bit smaller than our current apartment, but we don&#8217;t need as much space. It&#8217;s also newer. And it&#8217;s in walking distance from the school.</p>\n<p>We asked a few questions, including when their summer vacation began. Since my sister&#8217;s getting married at the end of July, it is important for us to be able to go back home at the right time, especially because my sister was already expecting us to be in America once we had &#8220;decided&#8221; to come back home. Mr. Anderson told us, &#8220;July 20 to August 13.&#8221; All I needed to know was that July 28 is right in the middle of that, so there wasn&#8217;t even need to ask if we would be able to take a few days off of work.</p>\n<p>The vice-principal, Mr. Moon, came by and met us. For a moment, it seemed like he was going to ask us to give a lesson demonstration (actually, he did ask us). We weren&#8217;t warned of that, and Mr. Anderson and his wife were kind of shocked. How can you do a lesson demonstration with no students and no preparation? After a few minutes, he relented. Perhaps we should have just stood up and started talking about&#8230;ummm&#8230;Idunnowhat, but we also kept in mind that, hey, not getting this job is not the end of the world.</p>\n<p>He did ask us to consider canceling our trip home, but we stayed firm. We had already told our families, and we couldn&#8217;t so easily back out on our word. Mr. Anderson, I guess, told Ashley that he would probably be like that just to cover his own tracks, knowing that the school needs two teachers, but also having to at least try negotiation.</p>\n<p>So Mr. Anderson gave us a copy of his own contract as a reference and asked us to let him know by the next morning (today) our decision. If we said yes, the vice-principal and the principal would then have the decision, if letting us come a month late would be too much. (The VP also asked if one of us could stay, as one of the teacher&#8217;s we&#8217;re replacing isn&#8217;t actually leaving until March 25, so one of us could come late without any worry. But we declined. If it was to be a problem, then okay, we&#8217;ll just go home.)</p>\n<p>We were feeling hungry so Mr. Moon drove us to a restaurant (and dashed away after telling the owners that he would pay the bill). So we had a bite to eat with Mr. Anderson and his wife and daughter before heading back home, and that was the best \uc721\uac1c\uc7a5 (spicy beef stew) that I ever had. I think that may have been when I decided I wanted to move to Gwangcheon.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_768\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/picture-9.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-768\" title=\"Picture 9\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/picture-9.png?w=500&#038;h=414\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"414\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Gwangcheon is here, by the way.</p></div>\n<p>So we got on the train and, while we were waiting during our transfer, we called and said that, if the vice-principal and principal agreed, we would work at the school. Then we finished our journey home. Hoping and praying that God&#8217;s will would be &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Just two days before this, we had expected to go home.</p>\n<p>As I stepped off the bus to go to work today, I got a phone call from Mr. Anderson. And we&#8217;ll be returning to Korea after a few weeks of rest back home in America. I&#8217;m excited and a bit nervous. As I said before, I don&#8217;t have elementary education experience, and this school, just like the one in Daejeon (although different in some ways I appreciate), is an English immersion school. We&#8217;ll be teaching subjects like science and social studies and language arts all in English. It&#8217;ll be different from our experience as &#8220;guest English teachers.&#8221; So we hope, with God&#8217;s grace, to learn quickly.</p>\n<p>So it&#8217;s very shocking to us, that suddenly we will be coming back to Korea. In my previous post, I almost made it seem like God didn&#8217;t want us to stay in Korea, at least for the moment. I did, however, say that I couldn&#8217;t know God&#8217;s will. I said, &#8220;I suppose it\u2019s also still possible that we get a job here, and one given by God\u2019s will, because nothing is impossible, but we must first visit our families.&#8221; And that&#8217;s exactly what&#8217;s going on.</p>\n<p>Everything seemed so perfect. At first, I didn&#8217;t like the idea of moving to a small town, but once I was there, I liked it. There&#8217;s a mountain nearby for hiking and a river. Walking to work means more exercise. Fewer western restaurants (okay, no western restaurants) means cooking more often and saving more money. Less city means less pollution. Living in a place with fewer foreigners means I should be forced to speak more Korean. The offer resulted from persistence beyond our control and it came after heartfelt prayer. The vacation time is perfect for our needs, and the school is accommodating our condition. We wanted to stay in Korea and learn more Korean, and spend more time abroad before settling down. Ashley&#8217;s mom had also wanted to visit us in Korea, and now she still has that opportunity (if she wants), to experience a new country with family who are familiar enough to be comfortable guides. Ashley has been quoting this verse for the last few weeks, and I think it applies here: &#8220;The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it&#8221; (Proverbs 10:22 KJV). The only question that remains is, Can we do this job? It&#8217;s a question that you have to ask yourself about any job, though, and I think the answer will be, Yes. Even if it takes some persistence and patience.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">- &#8211; -</p>\n<p>*And I did come back to school today, on Monday. At one point, I noticed that one of my co-workers was online on the school&#8217;s message system. She&#8217;s not an English teacher, but she enjoys talking with me and practicing her English sometimes. On Friday, I think my longest conversation was with her, when we talked about our respective plans for the future, and she called me her friend. So I went downstairs to say hi and saw also a few other teachers and the principal. We all sat down together and shared a big pastry. After some time, the principal asked me, &#8220;Brian, why did you come to school today?&#8221; I answered, &#8220;Because I should, right?&#8221; After all, I&#8217;ve used up my vacation days. &#8220;I think you&#8217;d better go home and take a rest until Friday.&#8221; (She later clarified that she meant including Friday). So I have this week off. I&#8217;ll go in for my final week next week, and then I&#8217;m coming home for a good, stress-free (i.e., without running around doing interviews and filling out job applications) visit.</p>\n", "post_id": 765, "location": false, "date": "02-13-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>Next month we&#8217;re moving to Gwangcheon.

Our flight is at 2:00 on February 26, so we leave one week, one hour, and fourteen minutes from now (the time changed to 12:46 mid-sentence).</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m excited. Home feels like so long ago. I wonder how it will feel to be on American soil after more than a year. To see signs, all of them, in English. To use bills that have &#8220;United States of America&#8221; stamped on them. To understand all of the various conversations happening around me in public places (and having to work a little harder to tune them out). To greet my family and friends with hugs and handshakes rather than Facebook chat bloops.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve got lots to do and so little time (at home). We also have lots of time and little to do (at work). I have five days of work yet, and as far as I know, I have no duties other than to be there. At home, though, we have to get ready. We need to pack up our stuff by Wednesday night, because on Thursday, Ashley&#8217;s school is sending a cleaning company to clean our apartment for the next tenants. On Friday (which is our final payday), I have to leave work a little bit early so I can go to the bank and close my account. I have two bank accounts in Korea. EPIK opened accounts for us all with Korea Exchange Bank when we first came, but my school does business through Busan Bank. I won&#8217;t be living in Busan, so I&#8217;m going to close that account. I&#8217;ll keep KEB, though, since I&#8217;m coming back. Sometime on Saturday the gas company is coming to shut off our gas (Ashley&#8217;s school is trying to get them to come as late in the day as possible so that we won&#8217;t be cold). We&#8217;ll leave on Sunday morning and go to the airport, where it&#8217;s warm.</p>\n<p>Then we&#8217;ll get on two planes. The first, a two-hour flight operated by Japan Airlines, to Tokyo. We&#8217;ll wait there for almost three hours, and then we&#8217;ll board a flight by Singapore Airlines, lasting ten hours, to Los Angeles. The reviews for both airlines are extremely high. We&#8217;ll arrive at 11:50 am, two hours and ten minutes before we left. I plan to call myself in Korea with the lottery numbers.</p>\n<p>Twelve days later, we&#8217;ll board Virgin America and come to O&#8217;Hare. We&#8217;ll be in Michigan just in time for my mom&#8217;s birthday. Thirteen days later, the day after my own birthday, we&#8217;re boarding a flight by Korean Air, another very popular airline, to go to Incheon International Airport near Seoul. After taking a bus to Seosan, someone from our school is loading us and our stuff up in a van and taking us to Gwangcheon.</p>\n<p>I am really looking forward to those twenty-five days. See you soon!</p>\n", "post_id": 837, "location": false, "date": "02-19-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>Right now, it&#8217;s 9:20 am (at the time of posting), Pacific Standard Time, because I&#8217;m no longer in Korea. I&#8217;m in Hesperia, California, for the next 12 days. We left Busan yesterday at 2:00 pm, when it was nine at night on Saturday in California. We boarded a plane and spent the next 16 and a half hours traveling to the United States.</p>\n<p>Our last night in Busan was spent with our closest Korea-made friends: Stephen, Brian and Kathleen (a married couple), and Laurent, a Frenchman who&#8217;s been in Korea for 15 years. We ate burritos at Brian and Kathleen&#8217;s apartment, played Apples to Apples, and sang some songs at noraebang (again, that&#8217;s karaoke, except you only have to sing in front of your friends instead of the entire crowd). It was a great night, in my humble opinion. We actually spent quite some time with these friends in the last couple of weeks, always saying goodbye, just in case, only for one of us to arrange another get-together at a Korean barbecue establishment or on a mountain trail.</p>\n<p>At the end of it, we went home and finished packing. We had packed most of our stuff three days earlier, because an administrator from Ashley&#8217;s school came by to check our apartment (for damage and to make sure the supplies given to us were still there) on Thursday while we were at work.</p>\n<p>We went to sleep and packed the rest of our stuff, the things we used right up to the last moment (such as our computers, toothbrushes, and last change of clothes), and cleaned the apartment to a decent, presentable status. At 9:20 (although he said to expect him between 9:30 and 10:00), Mr. Lee\u2014the head English teacher of my school, who considers himself our angel in Korea and assigns himself missions to help us\u2014rung our doorbell. I picked up the intercom and said, &#8220;\uc5ec\ubcf4\uc138\uc694?&#8221; (the standard greeting for when you answer a phone). Mr. Lee didn&#8217;t respond; I merely saw him, on the screen, look around. Ashley answered the door and he greeted us happily, explaining that he heard me say &#8220;\uc5ec\ubcf4\uc138\uc694?&#8221; and for a moment was embarrassed, thinking that I was Korean and that he had gone to the wrong apartment.</p>\n<p>We carried our stuff to his car and loaded it all in. We gave one box of stuff to Mr. Lee, who offered to keep at his apartment anything we knew we wanted to keep in Korea, so that he could ship it to us when we return. (He is one of the most thoughtful people I met in Korea.) I went to the security guard&#8217;s office and gave him the keys, telling him &#8220;\uc774\ubc31\uc721\ud638&#8221; (number 206) so that Ashley&#8217;s school could retrieve them for the next tenants.</p>\n<p>Then Mr. Lee&#8217;s son drove us all to the airport, about a 20-minute drive from our apartment (Mr. Lee himself never got a license). We gathered our things and said goodbye to Mr. Lee, thanking him for his year of great kindness. Then we went to check in at the airport.</p>\n<p>And apparently we were very early. Our flight was at 2:00, and we arrived four hours before that. Our flight was purchased through Korean Air, but operated by Japan Airlines. We couldn&#8217;t find any desk open for Japan Airlines, so we asked someone at Korean Air. She told us that we would have to go to Japan Airlines, who would open at 11:50. So we had to do some waiting. While we waited, I exchanged some of our Korean won to United States dollars. Ashley was excited when I gave her some Benjamins.</p>\n<p>When I exchanged the money, I handed the woman most of my Korean cash and asked for American currency. We&#8217;re keeping some Korean money not only to show it to people back home, but also so that we&#8217;ll have some when we return. The exchange clerk counted my money and then calculated the exchange. Next, she merely pulled bills from a box that sat on the desk in front of her. A box which had no lid. A box on the counter just feet from me. If I had had the nerve, I could have reached that box and grabbed a fistful of 100-dollar bills. I suppose few people would have such nerve, though; you wouldn&#8217;t get very far.</p>\n<p>Right before exchanging the money, I saw Stephen. He was on his way to check in and would come back and say goodbye to us when he was done. Later he did come back, explaining that he now knew why his plane ticket was so cheap (other than what he had already learned from Internet reviews, that Air China is a thoroughly terrible airline): he had to pay 200 dollars for an 11-kilogram bag. I think the charge resulted because, while most airlines allow one carry-on luggage piece plus one &#8220;personal item,&#8221; including a small backpack, Air China considered that to be two pieces.</p>\n<p>So we said our goodbyes again and Stephen went through security. We still had some time to wait. When it was time to check in, we approached the desk, and the clerk took our printed itinerary so she could check our bags and give us our boarding passes. For a few minutes, we were afraid. She couldn&#8217;t pull up our second flight, from Tokyo to LA. Finally she managed to at least ensure our bags were on that flight, so that we wouldn&#8217;t have to retrieve them and then check them again, and explained that, because our second flight was through a different airline, it seemed we would have to get our boarding passes at the next airport.</p>\n<p>So then we went through security. It took two minutes. We still had quite a wait, of course, and at one point I saw Stephen (again) because his flight had been delayed by about 15 minutes.</p>\n<p>Eventually, we got on our first flight, Japan Airlines to Tokyo. It was scheduled as 2:00 to 4:00 (with Tokyo in the same time zone as Korea), yet the flight lasted only until maybe 3:30. The captain had even announced at the beginning of the flight that he expected it to last an hour and a half. A similar bit of time-saving occurred on our next flight, too, because that ten-hour flight was announced by the pilot as nine hours (and he was pretty accurate).</p>\n<p>That first plane was kind of small, so I wasn&#8217;t exactly comfortable, but the flight was short. Despite the flight&#8217;s brevity, they served us a meal. It wasn&#8217;t anything at all big, but it was definitely more than a pack of peanuts.</p>\n<p>Then we got to Tokyo, where we went to go to our connecting flight. We saw a sign saying we needed our boarding pass to go through security. We showed our itinerary to the woman, who showed it to someone else, and they let us go through (after all, the print-out clearly showed that we had purchased a ticket). We went through security and then learned that our flight was coming from Terminal 1. We were in Terminal 2, so we had to go downstairs and get on a bus to go to Terminal 1. Even once we got to Terminal 1, we had a long walk to take to get to our gate. We were glad that we had eschewed a flight with a one-hour layover for one with almost three hours of waiting (a one-hour layover is my ideal layover time for <em>domestic </em>flights in America, not international flights between two different airlines overseas). We finally found the desk for connecting flights and got our boarding passes, and then waited. I think I fell asleep for fifteen minutes or so.</p>\n<p>Finally we boarded our plane, which was incredible. It felt roomier than the Japan Airlines plane (not that Japan Airlines isn&#8217;t any good, but it was a small plane for short flights). Ashley had a window seat, and the window was, I would say, almost a foot from her face, because the wall curved away from the seat to give passengers a bit more room. I noticed that the overheard storage bins were curved into the wall very nicely, as well, which was especially nice for the middle row of seats. I&#8217;ve been on planes before where the overhead bins over the middle seats simply come down as one big box from the ceiling, so turbulence makes it shake. On this plane, it was shaped to be more seamless with the ceiling, and I never once heard it shake.</p>\n<p>We each had our own TV screen with a remote control for selecting any of the various options we had: a library of movies, TV shows, music albums, radio stations, e-books, audio books, and games. I was excited because there were movies in several languages, including <a title=\"The Quest for Yeong-eo Jamak\" href=\"http://129degreeseast.wordpress.com/2011/11/28/the-quest-for-yeong-eo-jamak/\" target=\"_blank\">Korean movies with English subtitles</a>. So I watched two Korean movies: \uc624\uc9c1 \uadf8\ub300\ub9cc (the English title was &#8220;Always&#8221; although I think &#8220;\uc624\uc9c1 \uadf8\ub300\ub9cc&#8221; means &#8220;only you&#8221;) and \uc644\ub4dd\uc774 (titled in English as &#8220;Punch&#8221; even though the Korean title is simply the main character&#8217;s name).</p>\n<p>I also liked that flight because they gave us some socks. We could wear them, if we wanted, so that we could take off our shoes while wearing fresh socks, to let our feet breathe and not have well-traveled, smelly socks offending our noses or those of our neighbors.</p>\n<p>Finally the plane landed. We got off the plane, walked a long way to US Customs, and made our way through that. The flight attendants on our plane had announced that US citizens did not need to fill out a customs form, but I think they must have been mistaken. We did had to fill one out, so we did, but it was easy. I just wrote my name, birthdate, country of travel, then checked &#8220;No&#8221; a few times and signed my name. Well, I did also write that we were bringing some tea and clothes that were purchased abroad, but that would have ruined the flow of my previous sentence, and even that was accomplished in ten seconds.</p>\n<p>After customs, we retrieved our luggage and made our way to the world outside the airport. We don&#8217;t have cell phones in America, so I had to go get some change for a pay phone so that Ashley could call her mom and tell her we were here. We went outside, waited a few minutes, and then there were Ashley&#8217;s mom and sister. We crammed our stuff into the car and then made our way to Ashley&#8217;s grandparents&#8217; house, where we visited and ate our first meal in America: pasta, salad, and some amazing raisin bread.</p>\n<p>Then, I fell asleep.</p>\n", "post_id": 840, "location": false, "date": "02-27-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>\uc5b4\uc81c \uc800\ub141\uc5d0 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uac00 \ud55c\uad6d\uc5d0 \ub3cc\uc544\uc654\uc5b4\uc694. Yesterday evening, we returned to Korea.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know how I feel about that right now. When I first found out that we would be leaving Busan, I was upset. Then I looked forward to being back in America. Then, as our time in Korea drew to a close, I started feeling sad. Then we got new jobs and I was excited to come back, only to go home to America and realize I didn&#8217;t want to leave. Then I got on a plane and couldn&#8217;t wait to be back in Korea. Then the plane landed in Korea and I wondered, &#8220;What am I doing here?&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_849\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/graphquestion.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-849\" title=\"graphquestion\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/graphquestion.jpg?w=500&#038;h=351\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"351\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">So kind of like this.</p></div>\n<p>Perhaps it&#8217;s only because in two days I&#8217;ll be at a new job, and right now I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m going to do when I get there. Perhaps the undercurrent of anxiety is driving my thoughts on the subject, but I briefly wonder, &#8220;Did we make the right choice?&#8221; If you read my last few blogs, you&#8217;ll see that prayer and faith played a big part in our decision to return to Korea, but last night on the bus from Incheon International Airport to Seosan, where our school picked us up to take us to Gwangcheon, I wondered, &#8220;What if all of the stuff that seemed like perfect puzzle pieces falling into place was just to see if we would decide to take a leap of faith in America, and now we&#8217;ve chosen our downfall?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Well, I sure hope not. Now that I&#8217;ve written that out, I hear how ridiculous and paranoid it sounds. But I did realize over the last few days that one reason for wanting to stay in Korea\u2014to learn more Korean\u2014turned out not to be so important after all. In America, I don&#8217;t need to know Korean. Another reason I wanted to come back was Korean food. But you know what? I survived for almost a month without any Korean food. (Initially I planned on making some Korean food or going to the Korean restaurant and speaking Korean, but I never got around to any of that. Although there were a few times when I thought, &#8220;I feel in the mood for some naengmyeon or some doenjang jjigae.&#8221;)</p>\n<p>Finally, some of my favorite aspects about living in Korea were specific to Busan. For one, the transportation system in Busan is excellent. However, we won&#8217;t need it here, so that&#8217;s a neutral point. There aren&#8217;t as many restaurants and stores in Gwangcheon, but we&#8217;ll manage. What I refer to the most are the friends we made in Busan. In the last few months especially, we made some good friends in Korea. We went hiking with these people. We went to Korean barbecue together. We went to noraebang and sang songs. We went to the apartment of two of them (the married couple we befriended) and ate burritos. One of those friends left Korea when we did, so he&#8217;s back in California now. A few of those friends are still in Korea, but they&#8217;re in Busan. So now we&#8217;ve left our friends back home to come to Korea, but our friends <em>in</em> Korea are also far, far away. We also have friends we know both from home and in Korea, but they are also far away.</p>\n<p>So if we left two groups of friends to come to Gwangcheon, and if we can survive without eating or speaking Korean, why did we come back?</p>\n<p>I think I may have had similar thoughts in my mind when I first came to Korea. It was so long ago, though, so I don&#8217;t remember. I remember of my first months in Korea feeling very glad. But what about those first few days? Didn&#8217;t I sit in the taxi on the way from the airport, looking out at the foreign streets and buildings, wondering to myself, &#8220;Wow. I&#8217;m in another country. I&#8217;m in Asia. And I&#8217;ve come to\u00a0<em>live</em> here. This is&#8230;weird. What are we doing? Why did we come here?&#8221;</p>\n<p>So now I&#8217;m thinking similar thoughts and asking myself similar questions. I think I will have to rediscover the answers for myself as time goes by.</p>\n<p>And I think those answers will be worthwhile.</p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8211;</p>\n<p>AUTHOR&#8217;S NOTE: I intended for this post to be a brief summary of our vacation, but then I wrote the second sentence and this one came out instead. I plan to fill you in on our exciting time in America soon.</p>\n<p>Also, there are a few things I want to add to this post. They fit the theme of the post, but there was nowhere for them in the prose. One is that I remarked to Ashley that I didn&#8217;t realize how much I had missed hearing a bunch of Korean. Another is that I also thought, while looking out the window on that same bus to Seosan, &#8220;Look at it! Look! It&#8217;s Korea! It&#8217;s home!&#8221; (See? That thought doesn&#8217;t fit anywhere without disrupting the prose. Also, don&#8217;t worry, Mom. I don&#8217;t mean Korea is home as in I will live here forever. I think I have a few personal definitions for home, and Korea fits one of them, but there is just one word for them all.)</p>\n<p>Finally, I don&#8217;t want you to worry about me. I actually do know a reason or two for being here. But adding that bit to the last line would have been a terrible mistake, in terms of writing.</p>\n", "post_id": 845, "location": false, "date": "03-24-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>In the spring of 2008, I took a contemporary poetry course at Andrews University taught by Dr. Scott Moncrieff.

I haven&#8217;t been back for even a week, but I think I can say that it was unnecessary. The concerns, I mean.</p>\n<p>I know you haven&#8217;t heard much from us. I apologize for that. I haven&#8217;t posted anything here, I haven&#8217;t sent out e-mails, and I haven&#8217;t even been on Facebook very much to let people know that I&#8217;m still alive. In fact, if I don&#8217;t get on Facebook tomorrow while at work, I can claim that I didn&#8217;t use it on the job during my first week at all. I suppose today I finally had the opportunity, but instead I took a walk in the hallways and made a vocabulary PowerPoint for the next unit in science class.</p>\n<p>The similarities between my previous job and my current one are not endless, not at all. In Busan, I lived in a city and worked in a girls&#8217; high school, seeing, in a week, 20 classes of between 30 and 40 students (most under 35, though) and teaching only English conversation with very little structure and a truck load of free time I could have spent making better lessons. I wasn&#8217;t proud of my performance there. I had plans for improving it (mostly by coordinating more with the Korean teachers and spending more time and care on each lesson), but you know <a title=\"A Tale of Two Cities\" href=\"http://129degreeseast.wordpress.com/2012/01/31/a-tale-of-two-cities/\" target=\"_blank\">the story</a>.</p>\n<p>Now, in Gwangcheon, I live in a small town and teach at an elementary school. I have 24 classes, with 18 students in my largest class and eight in my smallest. Yes, I teach English conversation (one class of second and third graders, and one class of fourth and fifth graders), but I also teach language arts (one class of third graders and one of fourth graders) and science (one of fourth graders and one of fourth graders). Then there&#8217;s an after school program I have with eight third graders. Some of the other teachers have called the after school classes &#8220;glorified babysitting,&#8221; but we still learn English.</p>\n<p>In Busan, I was the only foreign teacher. Here, there are six of us, and one of the others is married to a Korean who lived with him in Canada for several years. She speaks fluent English. There&#8217;s no shortage of conversation partners. Of course, I kind of miss talking to Koreans (especially a few specific teachers at my old school). There&#8217;s something inherently different about speaking with a Korean and with a fellow foreigner. I think part of it is the bit of informational cultural exchange that can happen in such a conversation.</p>\n<p>In Busan, I had to leave my apartment around 7:30 and take the bus to work, then arrive back at my apartment around 5:20, give or take. In Gwangcheon, I can leave the apartment around 8:10 and get home by 4:40 (if I leave right away), all by walking for about ten minutes. Probably a bit less, even.</p>\n<p>In Busan, I had a job that is called, by many who hold the same position, &#8220;not real teaching.&#8221; Perhaps some of the materials our students are learning is a bit watered down for their grade level (considering the language barrier), but we&#8217;re still very much teachers here. We take attendance, give grades (in EPIK at the public schools, students generally don&#8217;t earn grades for the foreigners&#8217; classes), and teach numerous unique lessons each week. All of that made me wonder if I was up for the job, but after four days on the job (one day spent in training, by watching other teachers teach my classes), I think that I made the right choice in coming to Gwangcheon. Things can change in the future, but I only think that it will improve. My elementary teaching skills will be refined (plus I&#8217;ll become even more familiar with the setup of this school and the way things work).</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve really been hard at work. On Monday, Ashley and I watched the other foreign teachers teach our classes. Starting Tuesday, we taught on our own (except those classes that don&#8217;t meet on Mondays; those we observed, so that each class had one observation/training period first). With getting adjusted to the school, figuring out the system, and dealing with classes, we haven&#8217;t had lots of time to do whatever we wanted. Being newly arrived (with jet-lag lasting until we started work) also means we&#8217;re still slowly stocking our fridge and cupboards (we don&#8217;t have a car, which means I&#8217;ve been making one or two trips each day to the supermarket ten minutes away to either stock our cupboards or to make that night&#8217;s supper). Added all together, it made us quite tired. Most of this week, we&#8217;ve been going to bed around 9 pm, give or take an hour, and waking up between 5 and 6 am. That means going to bed three-to-five hours earlier than normal and waking up an hour, give or take, earlier as well. It also means that we came home, went to the store, made supper, washed the dishes, then had a very small bit of down time before giving in to sleep.</p>\n<p>And I kind of like it. The Bible says, &#8220;The sleep of a labouring man is sweet, whether he eat little or much: but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep&#8221; (Ecclesiastes 5:12 KJV). My labor certainly is more in quantity than it has been for most of the last year, and the sleep indeed is sweet. There&#8217;s something nice about going to bed at nine, not too long after dark has arrived, and waking up to see it off. As we get adjusted to our jobs, I&#8217;m sure that this won&#8217;t last, but for the moment I&#8217;m enjoying it. I previously had some concern about what we would do in such a small place like Gwangcheon, but that concern is unfounded, at least for now. We have no time for wondering what to do. We wake up, go to work, come home, and go to bed. It is a simple life, and one not so quickly desired for trade.</p>\n", "post_id": 896, "location": false, "date": "03-29-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>On February 26, Ashley and I left Korea for the first time since we had arrived in the country. On March 22, we again left Michigan for our other peninsular home. This post is the first of two about what happened between those two days. I&#8217;ll try to be brief.</p>\n<p>We arrived late in the morning on Sunday, February 26. We had left early in the afternoon on February 26, making February 26, 2012, officially the longest day of my life. We made it through customs quite easily and had no problem claiming our luggage. The problem we did have was that, having lived outside of the country for a year, we had no cell phones. At the airport in Busan, I had exchanged some money so that we would have some before finding ATMs (and good thing, too: we had been sent new ATM cards, and to make a long story short, we didn&#8217;t know our PINs). However, I was given mostly Benjamins. I also had a ten. Thus I had to make change with the ten so that Ashley could call her mother from a pay phone to let her know that we had arrived. A few minutes later, we met Ashley&#8217;s mom and sister. The hurry of airport pick-ups, though, kept our reunion effectively to, &#8220;Hi there! Let&#8217;s get this luggage in the car, eh?&#8221;</p>\n<p>We went from LAX to Ashley&#8217;s grandparents&#8217; house in Pasadena. We caught up with Ashley&#8217;s grandparents and cousins before having lunch and crashing (at least, I crashed, so I remember nothing that happened afterward until we got back in the car and went the rest of the way to Hesperia).</p>\n<p>Normally when we would visit Ashley&#8217;s family, we would be with a large group. There would be siblings, cousins, sometimes aunts and uncles. This time, however, there were Ashley&#8217;s mother and sister. Her sister, this time, had a job.</p>\n<p>It meant that Ashley and I would be alone for part of the day. It was decided, therefore, that we should rent a car. Fortunately, Ashley&#8217;s sister went to work in the afternoon, so she took us to the car rental place in the morning and dropped us off there.</p>\n<p>We entered the shop and, after the clerk asked us for a credit card, we realized that we didn&#8217;t have one. I had a debit card, but there was a set of extra regulations and stipulations for using those. We needed to go back home to retrieve Ashley&#8217;s purse.</p>\n<p>Now remember two things: we had no American cell phone, and Ashley&#8217;s sister had dropped us off.</p>\n<p>Thus began the adventure of walking to a nearby gas station to make change, using their faulty payphone, and then finding a better payphone and finally calling Ashley&#8217;s sister to bring the purse. And to wait for us. Just in case.</p>\n<p>We had a rental car, so we figured we should use it. On Wednesday we went to the Devil&#8217;s Punchbowl.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_920\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/img_3659.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-920\" title=\"IMG_3659\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/img_3659.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Seen here.</p></div>\n<p>That trip was about an hour from Hesperia.

There&#8217;s hardly any light pollution at all, so the stars abound. As for the daytime Death Valley, what would be there to see except a bunch of dirt-tan dryness?</p>\n<p>It turned out to be the opposite. Our night sky was a bit of a disappointment, because the moon was more than half full. Next time we go, we&#8217;ll have to schedule on a new moon night, when the moon won&#8217;t outshine the stars. However, we still saw dozens, perhaps hundreds, more stars than we would see in Busan or even in Berrien Springs.</p>\n<p>But the daytime Death Valley? I want to go back. I want to go back and take in even more of that beautiful, beautiful, beautiful place. I thought I would see monotonous, rusty terrain. I was wrong. Before we even got to Death Valley, I knew I was wrong. Google Maps showed the last hour and a half of the drive to be on a lonely desert road. What it didn&#8217;t show was how diverse the scenery would be on that drive. Every five or ten minutes, the terrain changed. I saw flat, brown desert. I saw small rocks and boulders. I saw desert bush. I saw a field of what I&#8217;m guessing was salt. I saw smooth, rocky hills, and I saw rough rocky hills. I saw mountains of several shades, patterns, and shapes.</p>\n<p>And when we got to Death Valley proper, it all continued.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/img_3790.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-919\" title=\"IMG_3790\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/img_3790.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/img_3775.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-917\" title=\"IMG_3775\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/img_3775.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/img_3741.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-916\" title=\"IMG_3741\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/img_3741.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/img_3759.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-915\" title=\"IMG_3759\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/img_3759.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a></p>\n<p>The next day, we drove another hour into the depths of Death Valley National Park to visit Scotty&#8217;s Castle. It was Ashley&#8217;s idea, and I wasn&#8217;t too keen on visiting it (&#8220;Why visit some random guy&#8217;s hundred-year-old house in the middle of the desert?&#8221;), but, again, I was wrong. Very wrong. Scotty&#8217;s Castle, with its innovations in its time period and location, and the very amusing story of its history, was yet another highlight of our amazing two-day visit to Death Valley.</p>\n<p>Finally we drove back. It would have been a standard trip if a rock truck carrying talc hadn&#8217;t slammed into the back of another truck on Death Valley Road (CA-127). The road was blocked. Cars lined up by the dozens on a road where you pass another vehicle once every few miles. We stopped there about 50 minutes, learning, piece by piece, what kind of accident had taken place. The talc-loaded truck had failed brakes. Normally on such a deserted road, the driver would have switched to the left lane to pass the truck ahead. As it turned out, at that moment there actually was another vehicle, a small car, in the oncoming lane. Therefore, the driver opted to rear-end the next truck. The driver of the car thanked him for sparing his life. Fortunately, no one was killed, although I spent fifteen or so minutes believing there had been no survivors. &#8220;They said two trucks,&#8221; I thought. &#8220;I just see a few bits that could be part of\u00a0<em>one</em>. No one could survive that.&#8221; But I was wrong. Apparently, it was just a case of the diesel fuel igniting and burning everything to\u00a0<em></em>gone.</p>\n<p>In California, we also met Ashley&#8217;s high school friend, the mother of her godson. On our last evening in California, we visited her house and shared a meal. We also went together to the botanical gardens at University of California &#8211; Riverside, which is probably the nicest (and most comprehensive) botanical gardens I&#8217;ve been to. I don&#8217;t think we saw the whole thing.</p>\n<p>Ashley&#8217;s grandparents also bought us tickets to a dance performance, which included a ballet performance plus a few contemporary acts. I wasn&#8217;t too interested in ballet, and I expected the event to be just okay. What have I said a few times already in this post? I was wrong. I had a ton of fun. I think it would have been impossible not to. The dancing was spectacular, the styles were varied, and at one point, the dancers grabbed audience members and pulled them onstage to join the fun. Including one old woman who appeared to have the time of her life on the stage and who, at one point, lost her wig.</p>\n<p>So that, in a rather large nutshell, was California. In part two, I&#8217;ll write about our time in Michigan.</p>\n", "post_id": 902, "location": false, "date": "04-07-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>On February 26, Ashley and I left Korea for the first time since we had arrived in the country. On March 22, we again left Michigan for our other peninsular home. This post is the second of two about what happened between those two days. I&#8217;ll try to be brief.</p>\n<p>We landed at O&#8217;Hare International Airport around 3:00 pm CST. The date was March 9, also known as my mom&#8217;s birthday. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m being too conceited when I say that my arrival was probably the best birthday present I&#8217;d ever given to her in my lifetime.</p>\n<p>My parents came to O&#8217;Hare to pick us up. Our plan, originally, was to have an early dinner in Chicago, to celebrate Mom&#8217;s birthday and our return. Instead, we decided to get out of Chicago before rush hour hit. We could eat in Michigan City instead.</p>\n<p>As it turned out, Michigan City was too far for our hungry stomachs. We stopped in Portage and had dinner at the Longhorn Steakhouse. We all ate steak, even Mom, who only eats steak at home.</p>\n<p>During dinner, my Mom remarked that it felt like we had never left. I wonder why that is. I thought the same thing, and later, while meeting our friends, we made similar observations. I suppose that it&#8217;s just easier to pick up where you left off with people you&#8217;re close to.</p>\n<p>When we got to my parents&#8217; house\u2014for almost 25 years I called it my house\u2014we were met by an excited trio of nieces. Perhaps I exaggerated that. We have a trio of nieces, but one of them certainly wasn&#8217;t excited. Abigail was less than a year old when we left, so I think she simply wondered who we were.</p>\n<p>The oldest one, though, run up to and jumped onto Ashley, holding onto her for probably a full two minutes before letting go. Kaylee missed us both a lot, but Ashley especially, I think because Ashley used to play with her more.</p>\n<p>When we left, the middle one only spoke a few words and so I wasn&#8217;t sure how much she would remember us. But when we got home she spoke in full, sophisticated sentences and called me Uncle Brian and talked to us as if we had been there all along. So that was nice.</p>\n<p>Ashley and I visited my grandfather for a couple of hours the next day and caught up with him, and later in the evening we saw our friends for the first time in over a year and went to a Japanese restaurant with them. We had also gone to a Japanese restaurant in California with Ashley&#8217;s mom and sister, an amazing all-you-can-eat buffet with quality food and a great price. There was no buffet at this place, but it was nonetheless fulfilling. And no, I didn&#8217;t eat a lot of Japanese food in Korea except for the few times we ate sushi, because Japanese food and Korean food aren&#8217;t really the same thing. Before moving to Korea, I had expected Korea and Japan to be similar and close, like friends. The actual relationship between the two countries, however, is not entirely jovial.</p>\n<p>In California, we of course had experienced some jet lag, but after a day or two, I think it mostly went away and, while we had a hard time waking up in the morning (who doesn&#8217;t on vacation?) we mostly kept to a reasonable schedule. However, I think Daylight Savings Time was the straw that broke the camel&#8217;s back. We moved 17 hours back when going from Korea to California.Then we transferred to Michigan and jumped forward three hours and, two days later, one more hour forward. We got tired, so it took us a few days before finally making more rounds to see more people.</p>\n<p>Finally we went to campus to meet people. We said hello to the folks at the bookstore and we made our rounds at the English Department, including a student-guided tour (i.e., by Serenity) of Buller Hall. It was nice to catch up and see everyone. Even though I&#8217;m sure my mom talked increasingly more and more about our return as it neared, the people at the bookstore still seemed shocked to see us. I guess the time can do that to a person. I guess it can also be a case of not knowing exactly when we&#8217;ll come marching in.</p>\n<p>Which happened in its ultimate form when, after visiting a few professors at Nethery and going back to the bookstore for a few minutes, we returned to the English Department to seek out Dr. Pittman. We had stopped by her office once but had quickly deduced that she was busy with conferences. The timing was perfect. We walked into the building and were perhaps ten feet into the hallway when Dr. Pittman emerged from another room down the hall. She headed toward her own office, which put her facing us. I think it took her a good two or three steps before her vision focused on the two approaching persons down the hall. My memory is a bit hazy on the exact details, but I think she made some form of audiovisual exclamation.</p>\n<p>In the end, we managed to meet with all the professors except Dr. Warren and Dr. Kim, though Dr. Kim joined the faculty as we were finishing our graduate studies, we never had a class with her, and she&#8217;s on leave. I think the familiarity is minimal in both directions.</p>\n<p>We had sated our sight-seeing, adventure-going appetites in California, so we spent most of our time in Michigan simply hanging out with our friends and/or family and relaxing. This included a lot of playing with our nieces. In fact, one other reason, other than sleepiness, that it took a few days to make it to campus was that I hurt my shoulder playing with them. I should probably add Ashley&#8217;s godson to that. The day before we left, when we had visited Ashley&#8217;s friend, I played with Jayden, including swinging him around by his feet and whatnot. Just days later in Michigan, I pulled all three nieces on a blanket along the hardwood floor, and all three of them combined are rather heavy.</p>\n<p>For a few hours, I was really worried. My mom thought it could have been the same problem she had with her shoulder, which required surgery. &#8220;Great,&#8221; I thought. &#8220;During the four weeks in which I have no medical insurance I need surgery.&#8221; As it turned out, according to a chiropractor, all it needed was ice and an over-the-counter anti-inflammatory (ibuprofen).</p>\n<p>What else happened in Michigan? We went shopping with my parents, who bought us some stuff to help replenish our work-situation wardrobe (somehow I managed to destroy most of my slacks). We also had a family get-together on one Sunday, finally seeing everyone else we hadn&#8217;t had a chance to see until then. We played games, ate spaghetti, and had a general good time. And on our last day in Michigan, we had a small birthday party (for me, because that day was my birthday).</p>\n<p>The next day, early in the morning, we started our trip back here, to Korea.</p>\n<p>I have to say that my overall impression of being in America was, &#8220;This is weird.&#8221; When we landed at the airport in LA, I thought, &#8220;We&#8217;re in America! Whoa!&#8221; When we were in the car on our way to Pasadena, I thought, &#8220;Look at all these cars. They&#8217;re driven by Americans! And look at those street signs!&#8221; While we were driving through residential areas, I thought, &#8220;Look, no mammoth apartment buildings! This is so weird!&#8221; Eventually, I adjusted, but for a few days, and with brief, occasional episodes thereafter, I simply felt at a loss for words at my present location.</p>\n<p>I also have to say that I think that this vacation, to America, to California and Michigan, was one of the best vacations I&#8217;ve been on, and it was vacation I spent, more or less, at home. Most people go away from home for vacation, but we went to it. (I suppose people who move away for college go home for vacation, but I didn&#8217;t have to do that, so I never had that experience until now.) It makes sense, though. It was this vacation wherein I saw the most people I care about, and it was a vacation that was actually and almost fully defined by the theme &#8220;relax.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Yes, I definitely want to visit that place again.</p>\n", "post_id": 908, "location": false, "date": "04-07-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>We haven&#8217;t been much in contact lately. I put up two blogs, but that was old news. We&#8217;ve been nearly silent on our life in Gwangcheon, and we haven&#8217;t said much beyond this blog either.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re still getting adjusted, in some ways, although in some ways that&#8217;s not quite true. A better excuse is that I&#8217;ve been sick for more almost two weeks now. I almost called in sick the first day, but I didn&#8217;t. I woke up a few hours before work and by the time work started, I was feeling better. That&#8217;s how it is. I&#8217;m sickest in the mornings. In fact, for the last few days, I have barely felt sick, or have felt sick not at all, during the day, only to wake up the next morning with another sore throat. It&#8217;s not fun. I feel fine, but all day I have to remind myself that I am indeed sick, &#8220;So drink some tea, and stay away from those cookies.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s good that I didn&#8217;t call in sick. Another foreign teacher did, so the rest of us had to fill in for his classes. I asked the head teacher what would happen if two people called in sick. He and I both had felt ill that day, but decided to come into work. He answered that the first to call would be lucky, and that the second to call, well, too bad. It would be too much to cover for two missing teachers, unless those teachers were genuinely very ill.</p>\n<p>This last Friday marked three weeks since we&#8217;ve returned to Korea. It&#8217;s odd. I feel like I was here months ago. Maybe it&#8217;s because I was, and not just in Korea, but here in Gwangcheon, from when we initially visited the school. But it also seems like this place is, well, where I live, and not where I just moved to.</p>\n<p>I wonder if it has to do with our life last year. We lived in Busan, in a foreign country, away from everyone, together but alone, keeping comparatively to ourselves. Here, it&#8217;s the same, although we have more co-workers who came from North America.</p>\n<p>In Busan, we went out to eat frequently. Sometimes once or twice a week, but also five or six times a week. Sometimes it was easier and more effective than buying a bunch of groceries and trying to use them all between just two people. In Gwangcheon, though, we&#8217;ve been out to eat only a few times, and one of those times was a company dinner. We cook much more often.</p>\n<p>I think it helps that we eat breakfast more often, too. When we first started working, we had so much to do that we would go to bed around nine or ten at night. Sometimes even eight, which is about four or five hours earlier than I would normally go to bed. We would get up earlier than we&#8217;d need to, so we&#8217;d make breakfast. In Busan I got into the habit of not eating breakfast. Now we eat breakfast more often, which means we can afford to buy more groceries because we&#8217;ll use them up. (Well, usually. I bought a bag of potatoes and used quite a few, but after a few days of not using them, perhaps a week and a half after the purchase, the rest of them sprouted massively.)<em></em></p>\n<p>Sometimes I feel like I&#8217;m not in Korea. I go to work, where I share an office with six other fluent English speakers. I go to class and teach Korean students, but most of them have skills equivalent to or better than the high school students I taught last year (I guess it&#8217;s not that difficult a feat). Then I go home and talk to my English-speaking, American wife. Even walking downtown feels slightly less like Korea. In Busan, I practiced reading Hangeul by reading signs. Lots of them, all the time. We&#8217;re not in the city, so the signs are less frequent. In Busan, we&#8217;d get on a bus everyday, either to go to work or to go get food. Now we generally get on a bus once a week, to go into Hongseong. It&#8217;s more analogous to living in Berrien Springs. I didn&#8217;t ride buses in Berrien Springs (except school buses).</p>\n<p>Well, I guess that&#8217;s all I have to say for the moment. The next post will just be a slideshow of some pictures I finally took of our surroundings.</p>\n", "post_id": 931, "location": false, "date": "04-15-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p class=\"jetpack-slideshow-noscript robots-nocontent\">This slideshow requires JavaScript.</p><div id=\"gallery-935-1-slideshow\" class=\"slideshow-window jetpack-slideshow slideshow-black\" data-width=\"984\" data-height=\"410\" data-trans=\"fade\" data-gallery=\"[{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com\\/2012\\/04\\/img_3938.jpg&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;936&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;Our apartment building.

Last week we had Wednesday off because of a national election-based holiday. This week, both Tuesday and Wednesday offered a bit of rest. I say only a bit because we still went to work. The difference was what we did once we got there.</p>\n<p>Tuesday was &#8220;Science Day.&#8221; This meant that the students did special projects. Some students built plastic-bottle rockets, while others put together puppy robots or played with something very similar to Erector Sets. The very young students only drew, but according to Ashley, they drew science-inspired things like space houses, underwater schools and apartments, people flying with rocket shoes, diamond-growing trees, and so on.</p>\n<p>Something I haven&#8217;t explained about our school yet is our grade level system. I&#8217;m going to divert the stream of this post to discuss that before carrying on further. Our school is an elementary school, and like all Korean elementary schools, we have grades 1-6. We also have six foreign teachers. Each of us is assigned to a grade. I have grade 4, I assume because I have the highest level of interaction with that grade. I teach a handful of second graders, about half of the third graders, a few fifth graders, and about half of the sixth graders. Unless I&#8217;m mistaken, however, I teach all of the fourth graders. Just not at the same time.</p>\n<p>The way our school works is that classes are divided into proficiency levels, at least for when it&#8217;s time to go to English class. So when, for example, it&#8217;s time for fourth graders to go to their English-version science class, some of them stay in their homeroom with their Korean teacher, and their English teacher comes to them. The rest of them go to the English side of the building and have class with the foreign teacher, without the assistance of a Korean teacher (these are the higher level students). For conversation classes, there can even be three or four levels.</p>\n<p>So for fourth grade, I teach language arts to the Ruby students in their homeroom (Ruby is the lowest level, while Amethyst is the highest, although most classes are split between Ruby and Emerald), and I teach science to the Emerald students. Between science and language arts, then, I see all of the fourth graders. I also have some of the Emerald students in conversation class with a few fifth graders.</p>\n<p>Anyway, because I&#8217;m assigned to fourth grade, I check their English journals every week. Students have to write one entry in an English diary/journal each week, and we mark their diaries. And for any special occurrence or activity, we go and help in whatever way we can, including for Science Day. We went to our classrooms and&#8230;watched the students build their rockets or assemble their puppy robots or draw their gemstone-yielding vegetation. Our head teacher had told us just to go for a short while, though, because there wasn&#8217;t much for us to do.</p>\n<p>After an hour or two, the head teacher and I went outside, because the students that had built rockets were gathering to launch their rockets, and we wanted to watch. So I took some pictures, spending most of my time trying to get a picture as the rocket was leaving the launching apparatus. It turned out to be rather difficult. If you press the shutter at one moment, you get a picture of a stationary rocket. If you press the shutter the next moment, you get a picture of a stationary, but empty, rocket-launching apparatus.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_969\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/img_4130.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-969\" title=\"IMG_4130\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/img_4130.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Exhibit A: Two deadbeat rockets just sitting there.</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_970\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/img_4059.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-970\" title=\"IMG_4059\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/img_4059.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Students waiting outside for their turn at the launchers.</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_971\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/img_4063.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-971\" title=\"IMG_4063\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/img_4063.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Two students saw me taking pictures and posed.

The school had thought the weather on Friday was going to be bad, so they rescheduled it to Wednesday. The first, second, and third grade classes went to a museum and folk village (Ashley is assigned with the second graders, so she went with them; actually the three female foreign teachers are with the lower three grades, while the three male foreign teachers are with the higher three grades). I went with grades four, five, and six to \uc6a9\ubd09\uc0b0 (Yongbongsan, or Yongbong Mountain) for a hike. I had a lot of fun. We went hiking, we stopped to eat lunch and share snacks at the top of the hill, and then we went back down. I really enjoyed that mountain, too. It&#8217;s a good mountain. I think I&#8217;m partial to mountains that let me walk all over big boulders, though, which may explain part of my satisfaction with the trip.</p>\n<p>The rest of my satisfaction may have been a bit of schadenfraude, though. It was funny to hear the students complaining about the strenuousness of the hike. Early on in the hike, one student who was talking to me said, &#8220;Teacher, I don&#8217;t know why we came here. It is not beautiful. This is not trip. This is like punish.&#8221; She did later admit, though, that it was beautiful. Once we were higher up and could see other peaks and into the valleys.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_975\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/img_4234.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-975\" title=\"IMG_4234\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/img_4234.jpg?w=500&#038;h=666\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"666\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Hike commencing in 5...4...3...2...1...</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_976\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/img_4236.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-976\" title=\"IMG_4236\" src=\"https://129degreeseast.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/img_4236.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">We've but gone a stone's throw and it's time for a rest.

Mondays are the busiest!</p></div>\n<p>You can see that I&#8217;ve highlighted each class with a different color to keep everything orderly in my mind. When I first looked at my schedule it was overwhelming, but now I realize how good I&#8217;ve got it compared to some of the other teachers!</p>\n<p>Here are some important features of my schedule:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I have 1st periods free Monday-Thursdays! (on Mondays everyone has 1st period free)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>I have no classes after lunch on Fridays! (Also we go home at 2:30)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\u00a0The number after the class name denotes grade level. Social Studies 1 is\u00a0\u00a0first grade\u00a0Social Studies. Con 2,3 is a conversation class for second and third graders.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald are the students&#8217; English levels. Ruby is low and Emerald is high. \u00a0I teach a lot of low level. It can be brutal at times!</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The title that appears after the \u00a0gem levels belongs to the the course text book. Sixth grade Language Arts \u00a0is reading Shining Star A right now.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The room number lets me know where I \u00a0have to go to teach the class. Room 1 is the first grade homeroom, room 2 is the second grade homeroom etc. E1 means English classroom 1. Instead of meeting with the students in their home room, we have class on the &#8220;English side&#8221; of the school, closer to our office. Generally we meet with low levels in their homeroom (where the Korean teacher can assist with translation if necessary) and higher levels in the English rooms.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>My last teaching hour of each day is ASP, which stands for After School Program. Some of the parents pay extra to have their kids stay for this extra &#8220;class.&#8221; We do have a textbook, but this class is generally considered glorified babysitting by some.</p>\n<p>My class, however, consists of ten high-level first grade students. So, although the schedule says I should be teaching them in the homeroom, I actually use E1. The other ASP 1 teacher has lower-level 1st grade ASP and she was having a hard time without the Korean teacher&#8217;s help, so we switched. My class tends to speed through the easy workbook&#8211;and once they finish they want to be out the door&#8211;so I have to come up with extra activities and songs to keep them occupied for the full 40 mins.Hhaha. (The parents complain if they see their kids get out of ASP early).</p>\n<p>Yesterday, since it was the last Thursday of the month, my ASP class had a snack party and watched Tom and Jerry. In Korea, kids bring their own snacks for parties. They even bring snacks for the teacher! I received an orange juice, an assortment of chips and a candy bar.</p>\n<p>Songs aren&#8217;t just useful for ASP, though. With first grade, I use the Please Be Quiet song almost daily. Sometimes I try to play the air guitar (lamely). It doesn&#8217;t make them be quiet, but it helps them practice using those cherubic singing voices of theirs. Also, they love imitating the characters on the screen, or answering &#8220;NO&#8221; in response to the song&#8217;s request to &#8220;please be quiet.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Teacher, please be quiet!&#8221; the first graders shout, but they&#8217;re only asking for me to play the song.<br />\n<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/KMRePMc01LM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></p>\n", "post_id": 990, "location": false, "date": "04-27-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}], "edges": [{"data": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 20506610, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 20506610, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 20506610, 20506610, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 20506610, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 20506610, 0, 0, 20506610, 0, 20506610, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 20267169, 20506610, 0, 20506610, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 20506610, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 20506610, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 20506610, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 20506610, 20506610, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 26890975, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 20506610, 0, 20506610, 0, 0, 0, 0, 30471950, 0, 0, 0, 0, 20506610, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 20506610, 20506610, 20506610, 0, 0], "type": "comment", "service": "wordpress"}, {"data": [34983486, 20506610, 20267169, 26890975, 26890975, 26890975, 57061671, 15866780, 55262702, 57061671, 20506610, 26706079, 38798733, 57061671, 57560433, 60461870, 20267169, 30361232, 35670308, 53439546, 57061671, 25751712, 15443364, 28883882, 29004534, 29852259, 30463372, 28575716, 30471950, 29430402, 28192393, 31865803, 32601614, 22757411, 8190629, 26048408, 33886395], "type": "like", "service": "wordpress"}], "metadata": {"services": [{"username": "Brian and Ashley", "display_name": "ashleyandbrianurias", "service": "wordpress", "service_url": "https://wordpress.com/", "location": false, "service_id": 20506610, "profile_url": "http://en.gravatar.com/ashleyandbrianurias"}]}}

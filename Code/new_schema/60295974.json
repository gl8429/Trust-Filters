Why is that?</p>\n<p>The mundane routine of our daily lives generally does not give us the motivation to keep up with a diet or fitness program, but when there is a <a title=\"Know Why\" href=\"http://advocareadvisor.wordpress.com/2014/07/19/know-why/\" target=\"_blank\">goal</a>, finish line, or event everything seems to fall into place.</p>\n<p>So that brings it to how to find that motivation. First, know that it is not as hard as it seems. <a title=\"Its All in the Mind\" href=\"http://advocareadvisor.wordpress.com/2014/04/12/its-all-in-the-mind/\" target=\"_blank\">Mentality</a> is the first obstacle, eliminate &#8220;can&#8217;t&#8221; from your vocabulary and make the decision to be healthy. Next, write down the plan to make it real. You do not have to walk six miles a day or go to the gym for 3 hours. As long as you put together a workout that you stick to the pounds melt away. Eliminate <a title=\"Fat Food\" href=\"http://advocareadvisor.wordpress.com/2014/03/01/fat-food/\" target=\"_blank\">junk food</a>, make lunch and dinner at home, and get the appropriate <a title=\"Wellness Triangle\" href=\"http://advocareadvisor.wordpress.com/2014/06/07/wellness-triangle/\" target=\"_blank\">supplements</a> to your diet. Taking in<a title=\"Your Body Needs Real Food\" href=\"http://advocareadvisor.wordpress.com/2014/03/06/your-body-needs-real-food/\" target=\"_blank\"> good food</a> alone will make the pounds fall off and excercise speeds up the effects. Finally, just stick to it, normally it take 21 days to replace an old habit. Get over the hump to motivate yourself to be the person you want to be.</p>\n<p>Regards,<br />\nClifford Mitchem<br />\nAdvocare Distributor<br />\nNutrition + Fitness = Health<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.AdvoCare.com/13087657\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.AdvoCare.com/13087657</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.advocare.com/13087657/default.aspx\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-7\" src=\"https://advocareadvisor.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/logo.png?w=300&#038;h=40\" alt=\"logo\" width=\"300\" height=\"40\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 10, "location": false, "date": "01-18-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["advocare", "motivation", "fatty", "weight", "nutrition", "athlete", "fat", "health", "weight loss", "fitness", "performance"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://advocareadvisor.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/1005113_207319449392030_2137759753_n.jpg\"><img id=\"i-110\" class=\" wp-image alignright\" src=\"https://advocareadvisor.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/1005113_207319449392030_2137759753_n.jpg?w=351&#038;h=272\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"351\" height=\"272\" /></a>You are the the driving force behind the change in your life. Nothing moves without your consent. There is not a single person that can make you do a thing that you do not want to do.</p>\n<p>You are your greatest motivator and give the pat on the back before anyone else. When it gets tough there is only the voice inside that tells you to keep moving forward and find the path to success.</p>\n<p>All that propels you to the goal comes from inside and where you have been is not where you are going. Choose the map of good nutrition, quality supplements, and constantly challenging fitness. That is going to take you to the better you, follow the path to becoming a Champion!</p>\n<p>All that you wish to be can be accomplished you just have to be the force that will take you and there and no desired destination is found without something laying out the path. If it is weight loss, good health must be the core and then the pound loss is just a side effect. Improved performance comes through quality vitamin, mineral, and protein intake.

Measure your inches lost! That is a better reflection of how close you are to the <a title=\"The Better You\" href=\"http://advocareadvisor.wordpress.com/2014/01/18/the-better-you/\">Better You</a>. Many people and trainers will say that muscle weighs more than fat, but <strong>a pound is a pound</strong>. It is just that a pound of fat takes up more space, less dense, while muscle is more dense.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">When it comes down to it ignore what the scale says as long as you look the way that you <a title=\"How Bad Do You Want It\" href=\"http://advocareadvisor.wordpress.com/2014/06/21/how-bad-do-you-want-it/\">desire</a>. Keeping in mind that you must be replacing all of the lost fat with vitamins and minerals for enhanced muscle development and proper replenishment. A <a title=\"The Power of Healthy Food\" href=\"http://advocareadvisor.wordpress.com/2014/04/19/the-power-of-healthy-food/\">nutritious lifestyle</a> will handle much of this, but the nutrient density is no longer found in modern food.

If you need help with the plan ask, search the internet, or copy what a successful friend is doing. To create the Better You follow this simple equation <strong>Energy Output is Greater Than Energy Input</strong>. Work out and burn more calories than you take in as food. Make sure that the food you take in is nutritious, stay away from processed foods, sugars, dairy, and grains. It does not have to be forever but you eliminate before you can reincorporate them. You can do it!</p>\n<p>After you have the plan it is only a matter of time and that time is shorter when you cast off fear.</p>\n<p>Regards,<br />\nClifford Mitchem<br />\nAdvocare Distributor<br />\nNutrition + Fitness = Health<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.AdvoCare.com/13087657\" target=\"_blank\">www.AdvoCare.com/13087657</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.advocare.com/13087657/BecomeMember.aspx\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-7\" src=\"https://advocareadvisor.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/logo.png?w=300&#038;h=40\" alt=\"logo\" width=\"300\" height=\"40\" /></a></p>\n<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZJ-MGfzpJZU?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></p>\n", "post_id": 174, "location": false, "date": "02-15-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["advocare", "motivation", "fatty", "weight", "nutrition", "athlete", "overweight", "fat", "supplement", "health", "diet", "fitness", "performance", "muscle", "weight loss"], "text": "<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><a href=\"http://advocareadvisor.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/1000753_621155404569431_1858719793_n.jpg\"><img id=\"i-246\" class=\" wp-image alignright\" src=\"https://advocareadvisor.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/1000753_621155404569431_1858719793_n.jpg?w=312&#038;h=312\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"312\" height=\"312\" /></a><strong>The decision to make a change to become the Better You that is inside is only the first step in the journey to recreation</strong>. If it could happen over night, infomercials would have been slinging it and what they have would be flying off the shelves.</p>\n<p>The simple truth is that it has taken years for the body to reach the state that it is in right now. It will take time to undo what has accumulated. The body is constantly under reconstruction so for most it will not take years to rebuild and the amount of time is directly related to your intensity. Just put in the time! Follow the simple formula of<strong> greater energy output than food input.</strong> For the ouput design a challenging workout program, something that will break a sweat is the minimum and then ramp it up to a sweat pouring muscle toning regime.

Although, they can influence it and that is given, which in turn we must change where go to get food first, then change what we permit to influence decisions.</p>\n<p>You are responsible to learn and develop a plan of action to the goal. A degree is not required to find out about healthy options and with the numerous advisors available all one has to do is ask. Taking the time to find out is the only cost due to the fact that one could get the equivalent of a college education with internet access alone. All one has to do is determine the structured plan to follow and stick with it.</p>\n<p>You are responsible for your success based on how bad you want to achieve the goal. Temptation will always happen and if you want success more than the tempation you will win. A complete abandonment of a particular food or activity is not required, but moderation and control is.\u00a0 Every action must bring you closer to your goal and your happiness, along with confidence, grows with every win.

The difference being preparing it before you are in need of it.</p>\n<p>For a meal ready to eat, make casseroles to get a balance of the food groups and in large enough quantity to last a few days. That way it just requires heating in the oven. Stay away from microwaves, it kills what small nutrient value foods have.</p>\n<p>Making food at home is far more economical than eating out and will provide better nutrition and be higher quality than what you will get in 99% of the restaurants you pass. The average meal is $10-15 each while brown bagging it will cost maybe $20-$30 for an entire weeks worth. It just takes some fore thought and planning to accomplish.</p>\n<p>Think in terms of the 6 P&#8217;s: <strong>Proper Prior Planning Prevents Poor Performance </strong></p>\n<p>Furthermore the impact that you will have on your health knows no value.

Keep in mind that even organic food are not nutrient dense enough to provide everything that the body needs, which is why <a title=\"Supplement Lines\" href=\"https://www.advocare.com/13087657/Products/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">supplements</a> are necessary. They are to <a title=\"Supplement Lines\" href=\"https://www.advocare.com/13087657/Products/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">supplement</a> the nutritious food you are already eating.</p>\n<p>The number one quest that people pose is what to eat. Fruits and veggies should be at the top of the list and salads should be large part of a food plan. One before each meal is a great start or even one for the meal. Leafy plants like kale, spinach, romaine, mustard greens, and collards so packed with vitamin A and K along with calcium and other nutrients. Staying hydrated is the next aspect to improve on. The standard practice is half you body weight in ounces. If you weigh 200 lbs the you should have 100 oz, which is just 5 bottles that are 20 oz each between the time you wake up to the time you go to sleep. One as soon as you get up is a great start.</p>\n<p>Remove or at best significantly minimize grains and dairy These vids explain why:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUOexcqfX4k\">Nutrient Blocking Effects of Dairy &#8211; YouTube</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbBURnqYVzw\">William Davis &#8211; Wheat: The UNhealthy Whole Grain &#8211; YouTube</a></p>\n<p>Reconnect with the feeling of vibrant energy, healthy satisfaction, and the Better You !</p>\n<p>Regards,<br />\nClifford Mitchem<br />\nAdvocare Distributor<br />\nNutrition + Fitness = Health</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.AdvoCare.com/13087657\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.AdvoCare.com/13087657</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.advocare.com/13087657/BecomeMember.aspx\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-7\" src=\"https://advocareadvisor.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/logo.png?w=300&#038;h=40\" alt=\"logo\" width=\"300\" height=\"40\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 332, "location": false, "date": "03-06-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["advocare", "motivation", "fatty", "weight", "nutrition", "athlete", "overweight", "fat", "supplement", "health", "weight loss", "fitness", "performance"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://advocareadvisor.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/1005228_699311710085155_2116975383_n.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-337 alignright\" src=\"https://advocareadvisor.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/1005228_699311710085155_2116975383_n.jpg?w=200&#038;h=300\" alt=\"1005228_699311710085155_2116975383_n\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" /></a>Do not be fooled, there are numerous side effects to being healthy, looking good is just one.

They prescribe medications, set and manipulate bones, and conduct surgeries. However, NOTHING in the world will do better than what comes naturally.</strong></p>\n<p>Water is the key resource of our bodies and next to mother&#8217;s milk when you were a baby nothing will do more for you. Be sure to get half you body weight in ounces per day. If you weigh 200 lbs, drink 100 oz of water or 5 20oz bottles, start as soon as you wake up. Get some nice reverse osmosis water is the recommendation.</p>\n<p>Exercise is the best way to stay limber and maintain health. Burning the ingested calories is what makes the healthy balance possible, through sweating out toxins and using up the accumulated calories.</p>\n<p>Sunshine allows the body to create vitamin D which is essential for the immune system to optimally function. Bare some skin and walk in the sunlight for 30-60 minutes each day. The more skin shown the faster and more is produced. The body discards excess so this needs to be done each day.</p>\n<p>Fresh air carries the clean oxygen that we need to live well and oxygenation of the body kills harmful bacteria. Deep breathing maximizes the amount available so take in as much as you can and breathe out as much as you can also.</p>\n<p>Good diet ensures the body has all of the nutrients that it needs to rebuild and cleanse from the daily environment. Modern food is not nutrient dense enough so be sure to work in supplements that you need to round out the requirements.</p>\n<p>Rest is the most sacrificed commodity in our lives. When you rest the body becomes most active in rebuilding and cleaning up. Sleeping is when the brain is actually reinforcing new connections and removing cell waste and muscles are growing.</p>\n<p>In essence the best doctor is yourself, as long as you give it the tools it will not need to see the next best. Give your body the necessary materials and it will remain strong and sturdy.

This a terrifying point in life and there is not anything from someone that has not been through it can really say to relate, so I will not attempt that. What can be done is feed the body what it needs. I am not a doctor and do not make an attempt to diagnose or treat any medical condition. I am a man who has read numerous articles, researched, and just applied logic to the situation.</p>\n<p>Cancer needs 3 things low oxygen environment, low pH or acidic environment, and a body deficient in vitamins and minerals. In the standard American high sugar low veggie diet all three of these lead to the epidemic rate of cancer growth and varying types of cancers. People tend to breathe very shallow and when they exercise to the point that they are winded for extended periods of time they oxygenate the body, which kills harmful bacteria and cancer. Bacteria and cancer are not able to survive in oxygen rich environments that people who are on a regular fitness regimen produce. This was discovered and proven by <a title=\"Cause of Cancer\" href=\"http://www.detoxifynow.com/cancer_prime_cause.html\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Otto Warburg, Nobel Laureate</a> who states that depriving a cell from oxygen for 48 hours leads to it becoming cancerous.</p>\n<p>Foods that are ingested into the body determine the environment of it. Particularly acidic foods like citrus fruit are good and actually cleanse, but dairy (eliminate), meat (minimize), bread (minimize), and sugar (virtually eliminate) create a<a title=\"pH and Cancer\" href=\"http://www.cancerfightingstrategies.com/ph-and-cancer.html\" target=\"_blank\"> low pH or acidic body</a>. Change what you are eating from the processed and fat foods to home cooked, raw, as organic as possible, and non gmo foods. Take in as many salads, fruits, berries, nuts, and vegetables as you can stand, then have some more.</p>\n<p>Nutrient deficiency is the core of many maldadies and to rebuild and strengthen yourself to become the Better You fortify your body with good material. Consider that if you use inferior brick to build a house do you expect it to weather a storm?

For most it is the lack of discipline and consistency that is holding you back. All that it takes to move dreams from just that to accomplished goals is action. <strong>Dreams without the discipline and consistency to make it a goal are just wishes.</strong></p>\n<p>It is no longer okay to live like this, you are meant to be so much more because you have the desire and simply need to focus on what it will take for you to become the Better You. Too much time is spent listening to the haters and letting their lies be truth to you. You can and you will overcome cancer, disease, debt, and unfulfillment, once you use your discipline and consistently do what you already know is the right action to implement. Eat nutritious food, always intensify your fitness plan, and include supplements that will accelerate you to accomplishment.</p>\n<p>Accomplish your goals of <a title=\"Challenge\" href=\"https://advocareadvisor.wordpress.com/challenge%20\" target=\"_blank\">physical</a> and <a title=\"$$$\" href=\"http://advocareadvisor.wordpress.com/303/\" target=\"_blank\">financial</a> health by including a <a title=\"Opportunity\" href=\"https://www.advocare.com/13087657/Opportunity/Income.aspx%20\" target=\"_blank\">plan</a> that does both!</p>\n<p>Regards,<br />\nClifford Mitchem<br />\nAdvocare Distributor<br />\nNutrition + Fitness = Health<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.AdvoCare.com/13087657\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.AdvoCare.com/13087657</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.advocare.com/13087657/Opportunity/Income.aspx\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-7 size-medium\" src=\"https://advocareadvisor.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/logo.png?w=300&#038;h=40\" alt=\"logo\" width=\"300\" height=\"40\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&lt;a href=&#8221;<a href=\"http://www.bloglovin.com/blog/12347087/?claim=kkwytka4hu4&#8243;&gt;Follow\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.bloglovin.com/blog/12347087/?claim=kkwytka4hu4&#8243;&gt;Follow</a> my blog with Bloglovin&lt;/a&gt;</p>\n", "post_id": 442, "location": false, "date": "05-31-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["cancer", "fatty", "weight", "supplements", "food", "athlete", "fat", "dream body", "program", "diet", "proper nutrients", "performance", "nurse"], "text": "<p><a href=\"https://advocareadvisor.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/triangle-of-wellness.png\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-465\" src=\"https://advocareadvisor.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/triangle-of-wellness.png?w=300&#038;h=170\" alt=\"triangle-of-wellness\" width=\"300\" height=\"170\" /></a></p>\n<p>Many feel that they are hitting a wall in their fitness program.

Without the sufficient nutrients the benefits of our fitness efforts fall flat. That is where supplements step in to fill the gaps. They provide the nutrients needed to enhance digestion, increase nutrient absorbtion, and when the body has its proper nutrients appetitie is diminished.</p>\n<p>To maximize fitness we need to have the energy to endure the regiment, then the vitamin and mineral materials to build muscle, and burn off visceral fat. The body is a complex system that does not use a single component by itself, but needs everything in connection, which begins with the supplementing our <a title=\"Real Food\" href=\"http://advocareadvisor.wordpress.com/2014/03/06/your-body-needs-real-food/%20\u200e\" target=\"_blank\">food</a> to have what is needed for the base reactions.

A healthy eating lifestyle avails most everything.</p>\n<p>Fitness is what accelerates the healthy accomplishment. Activity allows the body to sweat out accumulated toxins, use stored energy, and rebuild stronger.

The question is how does the food you eat make you feel? You feel sluggish? You feel fatigued? You feel bloated? You feel heavy? You feel <a title=\"Well Built or Well Greased\" href=\"http://advocareadvisor.wordpress.com/2014/08/30/well-built-or-well-greased/\">fat</a>? When the body does not get the vitamins and minerals it needs then these feelings come. Fact of the matter is that without nutrients the <a title=\"Before and After 24 Days\" href=\"http://advocareadvisor.wordpress.com/challenge/before-and-after-24-days/\">body</a> is not satiated and does not replenish itself appropriately. Even when a person is eating a balanced meal the food itself is not nutrient dense, meaning that you would have to eat an exorbant amount of it and it still would not have enough of what is needed for optimum performance and growth. That is why <a title=\"Wellness Triangle\" href=\"http://advocareadvisor.wordpress.com/2014/06/07/wellness-triangle/\">supplements</a> are so necessary in todays modern diet to not come up short.</p>\n<p>In the modern factory farm system the soil does not replensish its nutrients so fertilizers are used and these ferilizers do not have the full spectrum of nutrients that would be provided through the natural growth and decay process.

To overcome this an intense <a title=\"Armah Fitness Workout\" href=\"http://advocareadvisor.wordpress.com/superstars/armah-fitness/armah-fitness-workout/\">fitness regimen</a> is key along with a <a title=\"The Power of Healthy Food\" href=\"http://advocareadvisor.wordpress.com/2014/04/19/the-power-of-healthy-food/\">healthy lifestyle</a> that includes a supplement regimen that incorporates the lack of vitamins and minerals.</p>\n<p>Achieving intake of vitamins and minerals allows the <a title=\"Before and After 24 Days\" href=\"http://advocareadvisor.wordpress.com/challenge/before-and-after-24-days/\">body</a> to balance out, giving more energy to perform throughout the day.

His results are obvious and his continued use has been critical to his success on the Naturals Bodybuilding Circuit.</p>\n<p>Create the results that you want to see.</p>\n<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=UUqjBbOuuoBhOFz8zSF2skYQ&#038;hl=en_US' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></p>\n<p>Regards,<br />\nClifford Mitchem<br />\nAdvocare Distributor<br />\nNutrition + Fitness = Health<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.AdvoCare.com/13087657\" target=\"_blank\">www.AdvoCare.com/13087657</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.advocare.com/13087657/Opportunity/Income.aspx\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-7\" src=\"https://advocareadvisor.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/logo.png?w=300&#038;h=40\" alt=\"logo\" width=\"300\" height=\"40\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 78, "location": false, "date": "01-31-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["advocare", "motivation", "fatty", "weight", "nutrition", "athlete", "fat", "health", "weight loss", "fitness", "haters"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://advocareadvisor.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/1002486_575780162459870_1181868561_n.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image alignright\" id=\"i-86\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://advocareadvisor.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/1002486_575780162459870_1181868561_n.jpg?w=296&#038;h=294\" width=\"296\" height=\"294\" /></a>There is a little voice in your head that says you can&#8217;t do it.</p>\n<p>There is a little voice in your head that says the last time you did this you failed.</p>\n<p>There is a little person close to you that scoffs when you tell them your goals.</p>\n<p>There is a little person close to you that does everything opposite of what you need to do.</p>\n<p>These are called HATERS, and they are scared of you!</p>\n<p>Inside your mind the old you is pulling down the better you.

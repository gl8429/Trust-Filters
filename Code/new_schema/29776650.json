Basically, vampires. And the philosopher&#8217;s stone.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">But the answer is simple. No, I would not drink the water. I don&#8217;t want to stay young and party every day. I want to go to an age where I&#8217;ll start enjoying green tea and cashew nuts. And brown bread. Ugh.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">I don&#8217;t want my friends to grow older, I don&#8217;t want to watch everyone I love die in front of me. I could attend hundreds of birthdays, but if I was forever young, I&#8217;d have to cry at a thousand funerals.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">So, no. Forever young would be a risk at best.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Grow older, wiser and more experienced. Every day.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img class=\"wp-image aligncenter\" id=\"i-1020\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/l-fountainofyouth_warren.jpg?w=239&#038;h=362\" width=\"239\" height=\"362\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://dailypost.wordpress.com/2012/12/17/daily-prompt-forever-young/\">https://dailypost.wordpress.com/2012/12/17/daily-prompt-forever-young/</a></p>\n", "post_id": 1009, "location": false, "date": "12-17-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["pakistan", "life", "death", "postaday", "writing", "top stories", "poverty", "social issue"], "text": "<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://dailypost.wordpress.com/2012/12/19/daily-prompt-dear-leader/\">Dear leader,</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">I went out yesterday, to the inner city. My city, that from the outside flashes by like a green, glitzy, noisy blur that seems ideal. The \u00a0city that seems to have a viable beating heart in the center, connecting all who live, dream and toil here everyday. I ventured into this sacred heart yesterday, as I have so many times before. And I saw everything I&#8217;ve always seen. Filth, degradation and extreme stupor of \u00a0heartbreaking poverty.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-1032\" alt=\"tarapour20101101224734390\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/tarapour20101101224734390.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">And its not the city\u00a0that&#8217;s\u00a0the\u00a0problem. Its my entire country, nearly every area, poorer than the last. Overpopulated, cramped, crammed with sweat, disease, and unemployed masses. If you take a stroll (ha!) by the old train tracks, you&#8217;ll find crooked brick houses pushed up against each other in a dance they wish they could end. The houses can&#8217;t breathe and it seems, neither can the people. There are corpses because of famine, and corpses because of disease, and corpses because of floods. Bloated bodies, shriveled bodies,\u00a0<em>hungry\u00a0</em>bodies.<img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-1031\" alt=\"Families return home to their village in Sindh Province, Pakista\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/rs35121_316-scr-1.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">And so, Dear Mr. President. Since you&#8217;ve allowed the situation to get this out of hand, I&#8217;d\u00a0want a resignation. A stepping down, so maybe, just maybe you can put this country back on Marshall Law and into much more capable, less money hungry hands than yours. But obviously that cannot happen. You&#8217;re just too busy fulfilling your own needs: money, food, wishes, \u00a0laundered away everyday.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Since you won&#8217;t resign, try\u00a0<em>changing.\u00a0</em>You might not have heard of the word, except in a \u00a0negative light, but I assure you, it does exist. In fact, if you open a dictionary and try to look it up, you might just cross the\u00a0illiteracy barrier that&#8217;s engulfed the country too.\u00a0You might stop making shady deals with other countries&#8217; investigative agencies, and focus on doing some good. If that&#8217;s not too\u00a0<em><strong>foreign</strong></em><strong>\u00a0</strong>for you. That&#8217;s what everything comes down to, doesn&#8217;t it? This that foreign policy. Yes well, I&#8217;ve got a lot of local problems I&#8217;d like for you to look into.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">I know you&#8217;re almost never in the country, but I am. We all are. We&#8217;re suffering while watching others suffer.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">A hundred children are killed everyday, and the incident is hushed up. Have you ever visited their families? No, because\u00a0<strong>you&#8217;re\u00a0</strong>the one who ordered the massacre in the first place. And also because no one would \u00a0want you in their home. I don&#8217;t even know if you can read this, but regardless.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Have a heart, man.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://dailypost.wordpress.com/2012/12/19/daily-prompt-dear-leader/\">https://dailypost.wordpress.com/2012/12/19/daily-prompt-dear-leader/</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n", "post_id": 1029, "location": false, "date": "12-20-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["loss", "death", "animals", "kittens", "personal", "postaday", "newborn", "grief", "sadness", "cats", "pets", "coco", "love"], "text": "<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Right. I tried everything. Death really does come in blue and purple.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Coco had babies around 9 days ago, and I already wrote about how two of them died so suddenly because she rejected them. This is about the third kitten, the one that was supposed to stay alive and strong and healthy. After the experience with the first two, I now know what furry little death is like. And its ugly. And blue. Disgusting.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">I don&#8217;t even have enough words to describe how horrifying this is. I named this last surviving kitten Simba. I talked to it everyday and told it what a fun life it would have later on. As soon as it opened its eyes and started seeing the world. It would get to see its mom and the little house it lives in and explore every inch of my room, and sleep on my pillow on winter nights. It would eventually eat solid food and I&#8217;d get chicken made especially for it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\u00a0<strong>It never even opened its eyes.</strong><b><br />\n</b></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">All the forums told me it would have blue eyes because all newborn kittens do. Yeah well, I was hoping for that flash of blue. Not the dull de-oxygenated\u00a0one I saw today.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Basically, I checked on Simba last night and noticed it was slightly weak, so I put it nearer to Coco, hoping she would warm it or feed it. She did, but it seemed reluctant. I didn&#8217;t want to interfere, so I covered them both in blankets and went to bed. In the morning, it looked weaker and very very cold so I turned on the heating pad and tried to get its body temp back to normal. This worked for a little while; it started meowing lightly and moving around. I swear, I would have given it mouth to mouth if it would&#8217;ve helped.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">It kept on getting weaker and weaker, despite the kitty formula I gave it. Its still there, on the heating pad, but I know the signs. Its neck is a deathly blue, while its stomach and chest are dull flushed purple, like the inside of a bleeding orchid.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">I really can&#8217;t stop crying, because this one was supposed to survive. Why didn&#8217;t it? This might seem plenty ridiculous but I&#8217;m about to resort to praying for its tiny little animal soul, so it should stay in its fragile little frame. People say death is black. I say death is blue. And purple.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">And hell is having to see the life being pulled out of a tiny twitching kitten,\u00a0excruciatingly\u00a0slowly.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img-20121113-01106.jpg\"><img id=\"i-102\" class=\"size-full wp-image\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img-20121113-01106.jpg?w=580\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 103, "location": false, "date": "11-13-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["relationships", "life", "love", "personal", "postaday", "playground"], "text": "<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Setting: My favourite park.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Scene: A freezing foggy night, time was around 12.08 AM.</p>\n<p>I was on the swings, obviously. Back and forth, back and forth, with my hair forming a mist around my head, which was bent with eyes closed. And then I felt the stirring of butterflies in my stomach, the <i>whoop </i>and <i>rise </i>that you feel when the swing oscillates. And I got to thinking, right there, with my eyes shut tight against the frost filled air, that love is kind of like being on the swings. The setting somehow is always a figurative playground, more often than not, hosting games, tactics, wins and losses. And the very feeling, the <i>sensation </i>is just like that. A quick rise, and suddenly a fall, when you least expect it. You swing backwards, you\u2019re on top of the world, and you can breathe in the whole night air if you wanted. And then the dip comes. The rough part, where you feel unsure and like you could just fall off the swing if you don\u2019t grasp it properly. The quick plunge, suicidal enough in a context, and then a rising again. The dying, again and again, and yet still living. Going forwards, then backwards, and so the same dance repeated a million times, until you decide you\u2019ve had enough, and stop swinging with all the force your feet can muster. Friction against the ground, struggling to stop something you started, and finally, stillness. Being in love might make you crazy, with its dips and rises and the butterflies and insecurity you feel. But falling out of it is a mental decision, just like stopping a swing is a conscious one.</p>\n<p>And what about the ones who don\u2019t wait for the swing to slow? They just jump off, whooping, laughing and fall to the ground. Unafraid, unassuming and brave. Stronger than others, they have their lives in hand. They conquer love, not vice versa. But I\u2019m not of the latter category. Are you?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img class=\" wp-image aligncenter\" id=\"i-1041\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/img-20121222-01541.jpg?w=292&#038;h=219\" width=\"292\" height=\"219\" /></p>\n", "post_id": 1039, "location": false, "date": "12-23-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["life", "humor", "postaday", "writing", "fantasy", "fiction"], "text": "<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://dailypost.wordpress.com/2012/12/22/daily-prompt-unpopular/\" target=\"_blank\">Unpopular Choices?</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Initiate dream sequence,\u00a0since\u00a0its an unforgiving winter&#8217;s day outside&#8230;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">My sister and I were lounging lazily under the shade of a brilliant green palm leaf, our feet dipped in the crystal\u00a0blue\u00a0green pond, staring up at the sky. Since it was a tropical forest, the sun seemed to be on full beam, and the mellow sunshine made us sleepy and sluggish.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">All of a sudden we heard the clattering of hooves as a group of horses with their riders galloped towards us, the\u00a0<em>Maharajah&#8217;s\u00a0</em>army of slaves. They stopped respectfully at a good distance from us, wished us\u00a0<em>salaam\u00a0</em>and proceeded to inform us, their princesses, that our father was considering two new additions for our palace zoo. One was the Arctic Fox, and the second, slightly unpopular one was the\u00a0Phoenix\u00a0 Now why was this magical bird unpopular? Because the princes in the surrounding palaces had taken care of several and found the constant burning smell, singed feathers and repeated new births quite cumbersome.\u00a0However\u00a0 my sister and I were fierce risk takers and so we chose the golden\u00a0phoenix.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">It arrived duly the next day, and we went to visit it. It was the most beautiful bird we&#8217;d ever seen, and so we immediately named it\u00a0Scheherazade, the name conjuring up ancient images of sultans and night magic. I won&#8217;t say we didn&#8217;t regret the decision sometimes. The baby phoenix would get lonely sometimes and we&#8217;d have to traipse all over the palace to bring it into our bedroom. Since the palace had a good 500 rooms, this was no easy task, especially since the guard tigers started growling when they heard us prowling around. But we\u00a0persevered.\u00a0Scheherazade\u00a0would need\u00a0constant\u00a0reassurance, and cleaning and fire extinguishers.Choosing the unpopular choice brought us some\u00a0difficulty, but in the end, it was worth it.

And so I compiled a list of &#8216;How To&#8217;s&#8217; for anyone stuck in the same situation as me.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"line-height:14px;\">If you&#8217;re a normal person, you&#8217;ve probably offended one or two people in 2012. Snapped at your mom, dad or cat, or punched your sister\u00a0because\u00a0she stole your secret chocolate stash. If you&#8217;re a serial killer and have disposed of over 3 people, you can join in too. Now,\u00a0<em><strong>make a list.</strong></em><strong>\u00a0</strong>This is the fastest way to see what you&#8217;ve done the past year and to whom.</span></li>\n<li><strong><em>Start\u00a0prioritizing</em></strong>. Mom, dad and family come to the top of the list. This isn&#8217;t an apology list, don&#8217;t worry. See exactly what you&#8217;ve done, and how it can be avoided in\u00a0the\u00a0future. If you were mean to someone, this would result in a &#8220;I&#8217;ll be nicer to people&#8221; resolution and so forth. For example, if you&#8217;re a kleptomanic pyrotechnic and you stole your co-worker&#8217;s fireworks collection, your\u00a0resolution\u00a0should be &#8220;I will not steal, nor set fire to things.&#8221;</li>\n<li>Once you&#8217;ve compiled your list of resolutions, you should <em><strong>divide your paper into two lists</strong></em>. &#8220;Realistic Resolutions&#8221; and &#8220;Never Gonna Happen&#8221;. \u00a0This will help. So for example, &#8220;I will not wear pink since it makes me look like an over ripe guava&#8221; will go into the former category while something like &#8220;I will not chase the\u00a0neighbourhood\u00a0squirrels around the block&#8221; will be sorted into the latter.</li>\n<li>Then, write down your\u00a0<strong>Realistic\u00a0</strong>resolutions down on various surfaces so you have a chance <em><strong>to see them everyday</strong></em>. For example, post one which says &#8220;I will not cake my face with 5 pound makeup everyday&#8221; smack in the middle of your dressing table mirror. And if your resolution is something like &#8220;I will not yell at my cat if she eats my food&#8221;, paste that on your cat. A furry solution.</li>\n<li>Finally, try to\u00a0<em><strong>stick to what you&#8217;ve promised.</strong></em><strong>\u00a0</strong>Its easy to break resolutions because they aren&#8217;t jotted down in an official contract or signed by an authority figure. But this is a promise you&#8217;ve made to yourself, so try to stay with what you vowed.\u00a0<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><br />\n</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">The New Year should be a time for making and keeping promises, no matter how silly they are, or whatever other people think about them.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Some of my resolutions are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align:left;\"><span style=\"line-height:14px;\">Adopt a homeless turtle.</span></li>\n<li style=\"text-align:left;\">Volunteer at the local school for special children.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align:left;\">Go to London in the summer.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align:left;\">Go to a bar, for the first time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/220px-bigbenatdusk.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image aligncenter\" id=\"i-1139\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/220px-bigbenatdusk.jpg?w=210&#038;h=342\" width=\"210\" height=\"342\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\n", "post_id": 1075, "location": false, "date": "01-01-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["relationships", "faith", "humor", "personal", "god", "postaday", "lgbt", "truth", "time", "Daily Prompt", "love", "happiness", "history"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://dailypost.wordpress.com/2012/11/14/daily-prompt-14/\"><strong>Go back in time to an event you think could have played out differently for you.

I wouldn&#8217;t be any stronger.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">If I had all the morals in the world instilled into me, I would probably only see the world in shades of black and white. I would be self-righteous and would probably turn my nose up at free love and LGBTQ support movements. I&#8217;m glad I grew up as I did, because the &#8216;proper&#8217; morals might have made me rigid and close minded, and very hateful to people.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">If I went back a year and re-applied to a million colleges and actually got in, I would have missed out some of the very best moments this year had to offer. I wouldn&#8217;t have been here for an amazing cousin&#8217;s wedding, my sister&#8217;s 14th birthday, I wouldn&#8217;t have learnt so much more about myself. The personal statements I wrote this year are so much more mature than the ones I jotted down last year. They actually give a sense of who I am. I know who I am, and can confidently tell you, unlike last year.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">And if I went back and didn&#8217;t lose all the friends that I have, I would now be a bad judge of character and wouldn&#8217;t know how to see good people from the ones that want to harm you and I wouldn&#8217;t have become closer to the friends I know are genuine and constantly there for me.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">So, if I could go back to any situation at all, I would re-live it, but I wouldn&#8217;t change a single thing.

I went to the grocery store and saw packs and packs of Milo stacked together.

I mean, the whole world, and all the businesses in it, are dedicated to making standardized products. Products that can fit a variety of people&#8217;s expectations. And among this rise of standardized, &#8216;all the same&#8217; stuff, people are looking for <i>unique individuals.</i></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Anyone else see the irony? What if I don&#8217;t want to be an individual? How is EVERYONE supposed to be unique? Isn&#8217;t that a paradox in itself?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">I&#8217;m happy being a part of the world and having standardized products being made for me, on a flow line, just like everyone else. Not everyone can stand out. There can&#8217;t be customized things for everyone. The world is mostly the same, connected through heart and emotion.

I was one of the children who listed the following in my favourites; Chess, Scrabble and especially Monopoly.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Monopoly. In which we could all become rich, very fast. Being honest, it was no less than an adrenaline rush for me, rolling the dice, stacking up one property after another and collecting the stations, for the best rent. My sisters and I play it quite often still, and cousins too, and all of us shout in frustration if the other lands on, and buys the most coveted property of all:\u00a0<strong>Mayfair.</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong></strong>Those were simpler times though. Monopoly was the one game that united my family and gave us a few fun infused hours in the bargain. My mom and I never agreed on anything, except when we were playing Monopoly. Then we teamed\u00a0up\u00a0against\u00a0my dad and made sure we won! We even stole some money from him once, and then made puppy eyes when he asked for it back. My dad has been living abroad since I was 11. I miss him everyday, and I remember when he used to play Monopoly with me all those years ago. Still one of my best memories.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">My Monopoly got tattered and old, and I had to put it to rest. And so I did something I normally would not do. I went and bought another set online. I usually don&#8217;t spend money online for trivial things like board games, but in this case, I felt it was worth it. Monopoly Classic Edition is still the best board game for me. It literally united my family and gave me some really good memories.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-1248\" alt=\"monopoly-board\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/monopoly-board.jpg?w=240&#038;h=228\" width=\"240\" height=\"228\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">*If you want to purchase <strong>Monopoly Classic at a bargain</strong>, head on to Amazon. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000IWCT/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=allthosmathi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00000IWCT&quot;&gt;Monopoly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=allthosmathi-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00000IWCT&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\" target=\"_blank\">Click here</a>.</p>\n", "post_id": 1187, "location": false, "date": "01-03-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["life", "humor", "blog award", "personal", "postaday", "writing", "top stories"], "text": "<p style=\"text-align:center;\">I just signed into\u00a0WordPress\u00a0and found a comment\u00a0notification\u00a0by <a href=\"http://heysugarsugar.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Hey Sugar Sugar</a>, saying that she nominated me for the &#8216;Sisterhood of the World&#8217; Bloggers Award. Let me just say, for me, this is the absolute best thing that could have happened. i started blogging two months ago and saw many excellent bloggers who had these award proudly displayed on their sites. And oh how I longed for one!<br />So without further ado, here goes:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em><strong>Here are the rules for the award:</strong></em><br /><em><strong>1. Provide a link and thank the blogger who nominated you for this award.</strong></em><br /><em><strong>2. Answer 10 questions.</strong></em><br /><em><strong>3. Nominate 10-12 blogs that you find a joy to read.</strong></em><br /><em><strong>4.

Include the award logo within your blog post.</strong></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>1. Thank you SO so much, <a href=\"http://heysugarsugar.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Hey Sugar Sugar</a>, for considering me for nomination. When I started this blog, I never thought I&#8217;d be nominated for an actual award, so no matter how small it seems to other people, this is a huge deal for me. I&#8217;m beyond myself in excitement, and you made my entire week!\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>2. The ten questions!</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>What does your name mean?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">My name is &#8216;Nayab&#8217;, originating in Urdu and it means something rare, or precious.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>What is your most frightening childhood experience?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Hmm, one of the scariest experiences happened when I was 7 years old, and came home from school to find a black\u00a0Labrador\u00a0puppy waiting by the gate. I started running, and he gave chase, which led me to scream endlessly.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>What&#8217;s your dearest ambition?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Hmm, I&#8217;d say its a contest between two ambitions. Opening an animal shelter, or owning my own hugely\u00a0successful\u00a0conglomerate. Contrasting a bit, no?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>What&#8217;s your view on\u00a0homosexuality?\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I believe people are people, whether black, white, yellow, purple, or polka dotted. I have no absolutely no problem with the LGBTQ community, and think humanity is essential, and not sexual preferences.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>Do you sing in the shower, and if so, what do you sing?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">In the shower I feel rather grandiose, and so I belt out full versions of Adele songs, My Chemical Romance and Katy Perry. Shower head mikes are the best ever!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>If you were going to be stuck on a deserted island, which 5 books, movies, people and foods would you take along?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The 5 books I&#8217;d take would be the Harry Potter series (I&#8217;m categorizing them into one book, to say), White Oleander, Lolita, Wuthering Heights and My Sister&#8217;s Keeper.The only two movies I would take would be The Holiday and Girl, Interrupted. People would be my two sisters, best friend, dad and cat. And i&#8217;d take allll the food I could possibly get my hands on.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>What was your favourite toy when you were a child?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I had this plastic parrot which imitated everything I said. I took that thing everywhere, and it got so bedraggled that its neck came off. Tragic, indeed.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>If you have to choose a movie title for your life story, what would that be?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">It would definitely be &#8216;The Boy In The Striped Pajamas&#8217;. Not because I&#8217;ve lived through the Holocaust, but because I&#8217;ve felt that tight band of repression on myself. To be a model child, and conform to my mother&#8217;s ideals. And I do feel I&#8217;ve made a secret best friend on the other side of the fence, who I&#8217;m not allowed to play with, because society says so.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>What really gives you the creeps?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The thought of swimming down to the bottom of the ocean. And so, the Marianas Trench scares the bejeesus out of me.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>If somebody handed you a magic lamp and gave you three wishes, what would they be?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">First wish would be for the power to read minds. Second would be for endless wealth, peace and happiness for my parents. And third would be for 20,000 more wishes (greediness).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em><strong>3.\u00a0</strong></em><strong>I love reading these blogs, because they&#8217;re cheerful, sometimes emotional and \u00a0nearly always a bright influence on my day.

Falling in love? Go sing a song, because sane declarations of love aren&#8217;t in style anymore.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img class=\" wp-image aligncenter\" id=\"i-1353\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/snow.png?w=272&#038;h=183\" width=\"272\" height=\"183\" /></p>\n<p>4.\u00a0<em><strong>Slapping scenes are repeated three times</strong>.</em>\u00a0This phenomenon occurs especially between women. When a girl loses her cool and decides to settle the score with an old school cat fight, the slap she deals is showed three times, in succession. Indian actors aren&#8217;t content with hitting just once. No sir, if you must slap, then slap thrice. Or don&#8217;t bother fighting.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/timthumb.png\"><img class=\" wp-image aligncenter\" id=\"i-1357\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/timthumb.png?w=261&#038;h=162\" width=\"261\" height=\"162\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">5.\u00a0<em><strong>Dramatic scenes are always accompanied by lightning, or bad weather.</strong></em><strong>\u00a0</strong>Having a beef with your mother-in-law, sister or friend?

Speaking of beefs, <strong><em>in Indian movies, mother and daughter-in-law rivalry is\u00a0stretched\u00a0to unbelievable proportions.</em></strong> This rivalry doesn&#8217;t end in any normal ways; either someone is poisoned, shot, or drugged and lulled into a coma. So in the end, the poor son/husband trapped in the middle finally\u00a0realizes\u00a0what&#8217;s been happening, but by then, he&#8217;s already been made to swallow some mind addling drug, becomes certifiably insane and starts\u00a0squawking\u00a0like a chicken.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img class=\" wp-image aligncenter\" id=\"i-1367\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/saas.png?w=292&#038;h=164\" width=\"292\" height=\"164\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">7. <em><strong>Songs express true love, but did you know?</strong></em> You can apparently sing on tops of buildings, under the sea or on snow covered mountains in the space of a minute. Indian movies show happy couples celebrating their love by showing off perfectly co-ordinated dance moves on top of skyscrapers. So in an average day, when you&#8217;re hanging out with your significant other, steal five minutes and run to the top of a building, and start dancing. Indian movie logic. Did you know? You can also be in the middle of ferocious snow slathered mountains,\u00a0wearing\u00a0nothing but a mini skirt and short top? The climate doesn&#8217;t affect you, since you&#8217;re in an Indian movie. So, its a fact. Women don&#8217;t need to wear sweaters.

These two sentences define half of my childhood. How do I describe the obsession I have, just akin to madness? I have read and re read this novel so many times, I keep having to buy replacement copies. For those of you who don&#8217;t know, this is one of the most exquisite love stories ever written. Readers inevitably loathe the heroine, Catherine, with a passion, and fall in love with Heathcliff. They feel sorry for the Lintons, but despise them for their weakness simultaneously. Wuthering Heights is for me, true love (yes, a\u00a0teensy\u00a0bit exaggerated), but passionate\u00a0nevertheless, and pure. Anyone who has not read it, must add it to their list of Must Reads, or you have not lived. Also, I keep buying different editions of the novel\u00a0every time\u00a0I see one. This drives my sister insane.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong><em>&#8220;The Santa Anas blew in hot from the desert,\u00a0shriveling\u00a0the last of the spring grass into whiskers of pale straw.&#8221;</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img class=\" wp-image aligncenter\" id=\"i-1407\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/white-oleander.jpg?w=176&#038;h=270\" width=\"176\" height=\"270\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">White Oleander is a more recent discovery. I read it last year, and since then it&#8217;s become one of my absolute favourite reads. Its basically about a young girl, and how she struggles through\u00a0adolescence\u00a0 surviving foster home after foster home. Her mother, who likens herself to the tough Vikings, is in prison for a crime of passion. Astrid, the girl meets a series of foster mothers, each with different personalities and stories. This is fascinating in itself, along with the fact that the truth is stripped bare, and harsh facts are seen in clear light. Its a revelation of a book, and hosts some very complex, well thought out characters.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\u00a0</p>\n", "post_id": 1386, "location": false, "date": "01-06-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["life", "love", "family", "personal", "postaday", "top stories", "cats", "pets", "humor"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://dailypost.wordpress.com/2013/01/06/daily-prompt-favorite-person/\" target=\"_blank\">Hi, Favourite Person</a></p>\n<p>Remember last Saturday when I went to that sleep over?

Wouldn&#8217;t that have been dangerous though, you ask? Was your dad irresponsible or merely careless? The answer is no. My dad was just helpless, and I know this because I saw a home video of me as a 1 year old. I was in the baby stroller, watching an older cousin drink Coke. Immediately I started whining and stretching towards it, until she finally gave me a sip. I swear, this is all true.

The shades were drawn and very weak light strained through them. I was wrapped up in my favourite blue blanket, and my sisters had just left for school. All of a sudden I felt like there was someone in bed beside me. Now if this wasn&#8217;t frightening enough, I saw something moving at the foot of my bed, but when I pushed the blanket off,\u00a0there\u00a0was nothing. My heart beat raced out of control. I got up and went to the door, because I could sense that somewhere in the gleaming dark, there was some sort of presence watching me. The door didn&#8217;t open; my fingers were too weak. I hysterically banged on it until my grandmother opened it and let me out. Silence. Peace.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img class=\" wp-image aligncenter\" id=\"i-1473\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/aucdu0.jpg?w=249&#038;h=250\" width=\"249\" height=\"250\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em><strong>The Second Dream:</strong></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">A second after I had escaped the first dream, I had the second one. This time I was in my actual bedroom, sleeping just as I was in real life. I woke up, groggy and heard voices coming from somewhere in the room. And then I panicked. I ran to the door, and\u00a0realized\u00a0the voices were issuing from the bathroom. My breath froze, and I saw the blue bathroom light spilling out into the corridor. Silhouetted against this were three figures, that definitely didn&#8217;t look human to me. In my eerie state, I tried to run, but my muscles seized. It was here I realized that I was probably dreaming. And so, against the sheer terror, I squeezed my eyes shut. And then I woke up, in bed, my legs tangled amidst the sheets. I heard weak meowing beside me, and looked around for my cat. She stood there, watching me, but somehow it wasn&#8217;t her. I called her, but she didn&#8217;t respond.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img class=\" wp-image aligncenter\" id=\"i-1475\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/path_of_nightmares___ii_by_perception_obscure.png?w=204&#038;h=204\" width=\"204\" height=\"204\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">And then, I\u00a0<em>actually\u00a0</em>woke up&#8230;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">I have\u00a0never\u00a0felt such a strong sense of helplessness before this.

I played with them, and forgot about my sister at home in her stroller, a toy left abandoned. In the second grade, friends weren&#8217;t for ever. I learned that the hard way, and realized family will always be there. And so I learned to put my family first, always.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">At 7 years old, I already knew how to change diapers, and only I could comfort my sister when she fell or bumped into something. I learned how to take care of someone that fragile and to love with all my heart.</p>\n<p><div style=\"width: 317px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image \" id=\"i-1531\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/meoun.jpg?w=307&#038;h=204\" width=\"307\" height=\"204\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Baby Sister, I Love You.</p></div>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">At 8, experience taught me a lesson in patience. I was in a hurry to open a can of formula for my sister and then get back to my\u00a0TV\u00a0show. Hastily, I cut my pinky finger, which immediately started bleeding, the blood ceaseless as waves. That taught me to finish the job at hand, with patience.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">At 9, my youngest sister was born. This time I was ready. I helped my mom out with the formula, the diapers, the crying,\u00a0all tackled\u00a0like an expert. Because experience had done such a good job of teaching me in the first place&#8230;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">At 10, 11 and 12 I grew up into a somewhat awkward phase of life. Shoes didn&#8217;t fit, neither did most clothes. I was becoming a full blown girl, gradually. Through the three years, experience taught me to seek out the best friend I could ever have: my dad. He&#8217;s still there for me. Best friends for life. I&#8217;ve learnt that no matter what the conversation, or what circumstances, my dad will always be there, with open arms.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Teenage years were a different experience, which I&#8217;ll write about later. But truly, experience has been, and still is the best possible teacher I could have. I&#8217;m a strong person today purely because of it. My life would have been frayed at the ends if I hadn&#8217;t learned from it.

I found all the books I was looking for, used\u00a0obviously, which made them more special.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Secondhand books to me, have more charm than glossy unread new ones. There are countless times when i&#8217;ve found notes and old birthday wishes penciled in the leaves..

Augusts in Lahore are monsoon months, with heavy rain coming down at unexpected moments. Before I knew it, I was caught in a shower.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">For a minute, I didn\u2019t react. Rain was something I hadn\u2019t felt before. To be alone in the middle of a walled garden with rain pattering around me, was well, a fairytale of sorts for me. I remember sitting there, getting drenched quite willingly, and feeling the happiest I\u2019ve ever felt. To this day, I\u2019ve loved rain. A rainy day makes me ecstatic, to say the least.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">Anyway, coming back to the childhood memory, I sat there in the downpour until it got dark. And then something else happened. I saw lightning and heard thunder, until my heart was pounding. And still I didn\u2019t move. For some reason, I didn\u2019t go inside, and learned not to be scared of thunderstorms right there and then. Rain reminds me of that memory and the smell of the earth and how independently happy I felt there. Wherever I am, I\u2019ll always be happy in the rain, in water slicked soil&#8230;and the more thunder, the better.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\" align=\"center\"><img class=\" wp-image aligncenter\" id=\"i-1771\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/rain-for-tank-collection.jpg?w=292&#038;h=195\" width=\"292\" height=\"195\" /></p>\n", "post_id": 1747, "location": false, "date": "01-18-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["funny", "postaday", "humor", "personal", "random", "writing", "top stories", "crisis"], "text": "<p align=\"center\">This is the time when I managed a <a href=\"http://dailypost.wordpress.com/2013/01/17/daily-prompt-in-a-crisis/\" target=\"_blank\">crisis</a> while thinking on my feet, one that I\u2019m rather proud of :\u2019).</p>\n<p align=\"center\">I was sitting minding my own business, when suddenly, it snuck up on me.

He was a man, and not one at the same time. He crawled on all fours, walking like an animal, in between the cars, begging for change. When he ran, he ran like&#8230; (forgive me God), like a dog running from the whip. This was not a stunt or a gimmick, it was one of the worse casualties seen in Lahore.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Orphans and strays and children born but not needed are picked up or bought by these &#8216;business men&#8217; who then use a number of crude tools to deform their bodies. An eye is taken out to be replaced by a glass marble, a limb is distorted so painfully that walking is impossible, a spine is crushed and so is spirit.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">I once heard a case in which a man kidnapped over a hundred children, and mutilated their lower backs so they could only walk on all fours. To add to this, he also severed part of their jugular vein so they lost the power of speech, and could only make illegible noises. And then he sent them out, to beg and roam and bring him money. His silent apostles.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">The man I saw last night was bent completely over, crawling like no human is ever meant to. He must have been a stray, someone&#8217;s long forgotten child. Born in pain, and born to pain. Begging on cold streets amidst cars he can never drive, for he can never sit up\u00a0straight. \u00a0He must collect change and writhe back to his lord master, in order to retain a roof over his head&#8230;for who else will give\u00a0amnesty\u00a0to such a freak?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em><strong>Dear Teenagers Who Think They Have Problems:</strong></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Stop self harm.

He must have been deaf to sleep through a torrential thunderstorm, for starters. But that&#8217;s alright because with old age comes deafness. So far legit. Alright, <em><strong>so he went to bed and bumped his head?</strong></em> Was this before or after the snoring? Did he sleep walk, bump his head and resume snoring? This poem isn&#8217;t following a time cycle&#8230; Furthermore, if he bumped his head and couldn&#8217;t get up, that must mean he got a pretty bad concussion and fell asleep right after. In which case, he is dead now&#8230; but then why&#8217;s he snoring?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Okay, so basically this old man is deaf and obviously partially blind. And he lives alone, or someone would have heard his head bumping stunt. He banged his head, got a concussion and fell asleep in bed. But, by a medical miracle, he&#8217;s still alive and snoring? Seems like a pretty abysmal state of affairs to be in.

Copy and Paste the blog award on your blog.</p>\n<p>Okay, the <em><strong>eleven questions</strong></em>!</p>\n<p><em><strong>1. If you could have any job in the world what would it be?</strong></em></p>\n</div>\n<div>I&#8217;m dying to be a Celebrity Pet Psychologist. Its almost like spending time with famous animals 2 hours a week and getting paid in branded goodies and monies! Plus, its adorable.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><strong><em>2. What\u2019s your favorite non-profit organization?</em></strong></div>\n<div>The WWF. Protecting animals is wonderfully selfless work, since they cannot speak, or express themselves to us. I would want to open an animal shelter of my own someday.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><strong><em>3. Who was your favorite teacher in school and why?</em></strong></div>\n<div>I liked all my English Language teachers because they were passionate about the language and actually taught me how to mold it, expand it and make use of it with\u00a0writing\u00a0 both poetry and prose. Even though it isn&#8217;t my native tongue, I feel completely at home talking in English.<br />\n<em><strong></strong></em></div>\n<div></div>\n<div><em><strong>4. Would you rather have a telescope or a spaceship?</strong></em></div>\n<div>Definitely a spaceship. I&#8217;d take a tent, food and a hundred or so books and go camp out on Mars.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><em><strong>5. If you could spend the day with one celebrity who would it be?</strong></em></div>\n<div>Hmm, probably Cameron Diaz. She&#8217;s been my favourite actress since I 12. Her smile is heartwarming and cheerful!</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><em><strong>6. What\u2019s the weirdest thing\u00a0you&#8217;ve\u00a0ever eaten?</strong></em></div>\n<div>I once ate seaweed, by accident. For some that might not be weird, but to my 14 year old taste buds, used to Happy Meals and Slushies, it was torture. Slimy, wet and gooey. Yuck.<br />\n<em><strong></strong></em></div>\n<div></div>\n<div><em><strong>7. If you could be one age forever, what age would you be?</strong></em></div>\n<div>22. I would have escaped the awkwardness of teenage years and could go on forever being young with no hormonal issues.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><em><strong>8. What\u2019s the best movie adaptation of a book\u00a0you&#8217;ve\u00a0ever seen?</strong></em></div>\n<div>Definitely Lemony Snicket&#8217;s &#8216;A Series of Unfortunate Events.&#8217; Its the first movie I&#8217;ve seen which does absolute justice to the books. I&#8217;m hoping they&#8217;ll make a sequel.<br />\n<em><strong></strong></em></div>\n<div></div>\n<div><em><strong>9. What are you most afraid of?</strong></em></div>\n<div>Not being able to help people I love, or not being able to be there for them. Basically, finding my loved ones in helpless situations.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><em><strong>10. What\u2019s your favorite thing about yourself?</strong></em></div>\n<div>Haha, umm extreme modesty (aka self esteem issues)? Moving on&#8230;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><em><strong>11. What\u2019s your favorite ice cream?</strong></em></div>\n<div>Mint chocolate chip! Definitely the best ice cream flavour I have had up till now <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-bigsmile' title=':D'>:D</span>.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Alright, time for the random facts now:</div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div><em>My favourite colour is teal &#8211; a mixture between blue and green.</em></div>\n<div><em>I&#8217;ve\u00a0been a lucid dreamer since I was 7 years old.</em></div>\n<div><em>Mental illness frightens me to death.</em></div>\n<div><em>I collect various notepads and notebooks. Obsessively.</em></div>\n<div><em>The ideal birthday present for me would be books.</em></div>\n<div><em>A Song of Fire and Ice has become my favourite book series.</em></div>\n<div><em>I think penguins are the cutest birds alive.</em></div>\n<div><em>Garlic mayo fries are my favourite.</em></div>\n<div><em>Marriage is a confusing institution to me.</em></div>\n<div><em>Green ink filled pens are awesome.</em></div>\n<div><em>I don&#8217;t like odd numbers.

The partner who&#8217;s been cheated on will undoubtedly be hurt beyond reason, but what about the cheater? Perhaps he or she was being taken for granted, or felt ignored.

Don&#8217;t wait for February, because its too sentimental and has emotional and material pressure.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">I&#8217;d prefer a flower and a kiss every day, rather than a bouquet of diamonds just on February 14th.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/j.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image\" id=\"i-1984\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/j.jpg?w=249\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 1966, "location": false, "date": "02-01-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["funny", "postaday", "humor", "personal", "random", "writing", "top stories", "blogging"], "text": "<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://dailypost.wordpress.com/2013/02/01/daily-prompt-flangiprop/\" target=\"_blank\">&#8220;Flangiprop&#8221;</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Hmm.

But WAIT. It&#8217;s not on your left where you left it before sleeping. You twist and fumble and get tangled and you still can&#8217;t locate the device. Then wild thoughts start to form.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">&#8220;<em>Did my dog/cat/sister eat or break it?!!&#8221;</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">&#8220;<em>Did it fall under the bed??&#8221;</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">&#8220;<em>Maybe that strange Japanese girl living in my closet got to it.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">And more wild thoughts. Until you&#8217;re panicking and huffing and puffing. All of a sudden you sit up, and discover the phone has slipped under your pillow. You heave a sigh of relief and thank God for this miracle. If this has ever happened to you, you&#8217;re more attached to your cellphone than a fish is to a hook, when\u00a0snagged.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong><em>Number Two:</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">You&#8217;re at a dinner party, or some other formal event. It doesn&#8217;t matter what you&#8217;re wearing or whether you have pockets or a handbag. Your phone will be tightly\u00a0clutched\u00a0in your hand, and you will keep it there even if you have to carry drinks, food or give empty compliments to old aunts and uncles. If you have your cellphone, a plate of shrimp, a drink and lies for your liver spotted relatives in your hands simultaneously, you are addicted to the phone. No question.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em><strong>Number Three:</strong></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Have you ever spaced out while texting or checking on social networks? If any version of this conversation has ever happened to you, your cellphone is not just a device, it is a certified family member:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em>Family Member/Friend/Pet\u00a0Squirrel: Hey, what&#8217;s up today?</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">*you&#8217;re too busy staring at phone to reply*</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em>&#8220;I&#8217;m talking to you, could you like, look at me?&#8221;</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">*you give illegible mumble in reply with unfocused glazed over look*</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">&#8220;<em>Umm hello? Could you leave your phone for one tiny second to listen to me?&#8221;</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">*you put down the phone and snap*</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em><strong>Number Four:</strong></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">You take your cellphone into the bathroom. And you text whilst\u00a0<em>in\u00a0</em>the shower. No, peeing for a minute won&#8217;t send you into the seven hells of boredom. Getting bored is not an excuse to take your cellphone inside with you. However, like me, if you find yourself texting, playing games or otherwise just staring at the screen while doing your business, you are definitely in love with your phone. Texting or calling whilst in the shower is another sign. What&#8217;s so important that you can&#8217;t wait to reply to in ten minutes? This is something my mother never tires of asking me. Yes, I text in the shower.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">If you have experienced any of these four\u00a0major\u00a0signs (like I have), your cellphone is a lifeline to you (like mine is). I&#8217;ve started calling it &#8216;Blood of my blood&#8217; recently, but that&#8217;s a whole other story.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 302px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\" wp-image \" id=\"i-2026\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/galaxy_siii_mini_product_image4.jpg?w=292&#038;h=194\" width=\"292\" height=\"194\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Blood of my blood&#8230;</p></div>\n", "post_id": 2000, "location": false, "date": "02-07-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["life", "postaday", "private and public sector", "writing", "top stories", "healthcare", "medical care", "politics", "corruption"], "text": "<p style=\"text-align:center;\">I shall compare <a href=\"http://dailypost.wordpress.com/2013/02/07/daily-prompt-healthcare/\" target=\"_blank\">private and public healthcare</a> (for my country) using a delightful metaphor that involves penguins.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">So, first are the really fat penguins who give government healthcare. They finance themselves using taxes, which they increase each year to support\u00a0different\u00a0endeavours. These are the ones who have all the fish, and the big kahuna, or lord penguin controls all of it. He&#8217;s the fattest, and the smarmiest. He builds a hospital every two years, and everyone salutes him, but the hospital he builds is understaffed,\u00a0unhygienic\u00a0and lacks proper equipment. Often, emergency cases cannot be entertained. Moreover, if a penguin slips and knocks its skull open on an iceberg, chances are it&#8217;ll die there, because the ambulance won&#8217;t get to him on time. However,\u00a0every\u00a0penguin\u00a0from\u00a0far and wide can access this healthcare, at least by theory.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Moving on to private healthcare. Now this is a group of penguins who have a lot of money. Either out of ethics or boredom, they have chosen to build medical\u00a0facilities\u00a0for other penguins. In their case, the equipment is top of the line, the ambulances fast and the staff happy and well trained. They face two problems. One, they cannot collect monies by taxation, and so may fall short of funds, until another private penguin investor decides to donate. Also, not all penguins can\u00a0receive\u00a0this attention; only\u00a0the\u00a0ones with money can. So basically, this group of penguins is elite and tight knit. If a pregnant penguin is rushed to their hospital they can deliver her baby in excellent conditions.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">So I guess my point is that public healthcare is open to all, but private healthcare saves lives.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Both sets of penguins should work together. The corrupt fat ones should provide finance while the elite, ethical ones should take over building and facilities. That way, money might end up where it was intended to.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img class=\" wp-image aligncenter\" id=\"i-2049\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/penguin-chick.jpg?w=236&#038;h=293\" width=\"236\" height=\"293\" /></p>\n", "post_id": 2033, "location": false, "date": "02-07-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["spiritualism", "life", "past life", "magic", "top stories", "personal", "postaday", "reincarnation", "humor"], "text": "<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://dailypost.wordpress.com/2013/02/08/daily-prompt-reincarnation/\">Re-incarnation.</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Of course I believe in it!

I also know that often this is not possible.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">What I do know is however, that no one should fight for top position as it were, after a Darwin-esque manner. So,\u00a0<strong>Rule Number One\u00a0</strong>as I see it, is\u00a0<em>Respect.</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Brace yourselves:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"line-height:14px;\">Don&#8217;t yell. Raising your voice unnecessarily causes a loss of respect.</span></li>\n<li>Respect isn&#8217;t given or seized, it&#8217;s earned. Treat your partner like you want him to treat you.</li>\n<li>I cannot stress this point enough:\u00a0<strong>NO emasculation.\u00a0</strong>This is obviously for girls/women. In any case of any situation, emasculation is not okay. It won&#8217;t get you an iota of respect, and once you step down this path, it can be hard to stop.</li>\n<li>Absolutely never say &#8216;I told you so.&#8217; This might be frustrating and sound impossible, but try to restrain yourself. Taunting and I told you so&#8217;s pave the way for drama and nastiness, but never respect.</li>\n<li>Lastly, become a good listener. Never shoo away your partner when they need you, it&#8217;s just not wise. Listen calmly and sincerely, and instead of dispensing advice, just make the other person feel like they have a true listener in you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img class=\" wp-image aligncenter\" id=\"i-2153\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/couple3silhouette.jpg?w=217&#038;h=280\" width=\"217\" height=\"280\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">I have seen the worst example of a ruined marriage for some 12 years so far and I hope I never make the mistake with my own life. Therefore, rules should apply. And\u00a0<strong>respect\u00a0</strong>is underrated, I do believe.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\u00a0</p>\n", "post_id": 2132, "location": false, "date": "03-10-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["life", "random", "humor", "top stories", "personal", "postaday", "survive a gap year", "students", "college"], "text": "<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>Gap Year:</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">(def.) A year that you take off from &#8216;normal&#8217; life, namely hole up at home and veg out, away from real\u00a0responsibilities, basically adult stuff.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">This year that I took off from real life, has been strange. I took a vacation because I got rejected from the one university I wanted to get into, and therefore I wallowed in self pity and stayed home. It&#8217;s taken me 11 months to find the guts to face up to it and make a set of survival rules. SO.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img class=\" wp-image aligncenter\" id=\"i-2223\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/0257070001277555163-college.jpg?w=234&#038;h=351\" width=\"234\" height=\"351\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>HOW TO STAY SANE DURING YOUR GAP YEAR:</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">1.\u00a0<strong>Deny deny.</strong>\u00a0Basically, go into self imposed denial. Strike a bright pose, open a random book and tell anyone who passes by that you&#8217;re most definitely not going to waste this year. Just because you didn&#8217;t get into university doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;re a failure. You&#8217;ll learn an instrument, you&#8217;ll learn a language, yeah, you should learn to just\u00a0<em>get real</em>. Chances are, you&#8217;ll spend your days in sweatpants with a bag of chips and/or a batch of brownies that you made in the microwave, because you&#8217;re just that lazy now.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">2.\u00a0<strong>Get Emotional.\u00a0</strong>Once you&#8217;ve snapped out of sweet denial, it can be difficult to face reality. You&#8217;ll scream at people for no reason. You&#8217;ll suddenly start seeing friends who&#8217;re in college and hating their lives, hating yourself and hating your gap year. You&#8217;ll probably become one of those people who throw their cats on their laptop, because a happy Facebook timeline will disgruntle you. You&#8217;ll start bawling when you see happy shiny people on Nickelodeon. Don&#8217;t let this happen.\u00a0Realize\u00a0that this year can actually become your best friend&#8230;sort of.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">3.\u00a0<strong>Go Into A Mental Coma.\u00a0</strong>All the negativity will inevitable strangle you to the point of unresponsiveness. You&#8217;ll see your siblings living lives, going out with friends.\u00a0<em>Friends,\u00a0</em>you know, the ones you used to have before they went to college too. At this point, you&#8217;ll probably be so messed in the head, you&#8217;ll go into self imposed exile. You&#8217;ll get your headphones, listen to some feeling-filled music and shake your head at everything. This is rock bottom. You really can&#8217;t sink lower. At this point, other things will start cropping up. For example, you&#8217;ll suddenly remember that time in grade 3 when you fought with your best friend, or when the teacher yelled at you. Trivial things like that. Old memories will start to sting. This will feel awful, but remember. It&#8217;s the last thing. It&#8217;ll get better from here.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">4. <strong>Open Your Eyes.\u00a0</strong>You&#8217;ll wake up and see the world anew. Suddenly, those happy people on Facebook and Twitter will seem attractive. You&#8217;ll message an old friend, asking about college, and reconnect with everyone you left behind. You&#8217;ll feel better about yourself, and see all the free time you have as something positive, and will even take your pet dog/cat/pigeon out for a walk or kill. Live this moment, because it won&#8217;t come back. This happy dopamine infused person you&#8217;ve become won&#8217;t last. I&#8217;m sorry.<b><br />\n</b></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">5.\u00a0<strong>Philosophize.\u00a0</strong>This is the last and possibly permanent stage of the gap year. You&#8217;ll start to become philosophical about everything. For example, when a sibling asks you for advice, you&#8217;ll say &#8220;I can give you this advice because I know so much more now. I&#8217;ve literally grown up in the past year.&#8221; and so on&#8230;you&#8217;ll have some ups and downs. At times you&#8217;ll feel content and at others you&#8217;ll contemplate poison. You&#8217;ll feel like a failure, you&#8217;ll feel like a deity. You&#8217;ll feel bipolar. Not to worry, this stage will last, but it&#8217;s not that bad. And inasmuch you think you&#8217;ve grown too old for college, you haven&#8217;t. This was just one year in a string of numerous more, and someday you WILL look back and laugh (or sigh pityingly&#8230;). You&#8217;ll go to college, party and be okay.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image aligncenter\" id=\"i-2229\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/images-2.jpg?w=198&#038;h=230\" width=\"198\" height=\"230\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Just get through this year.

Actually, since I&#8217;d be so brilliant, I would just politely and demurely congratulate myself, sit at the house table and immediately start discussing complicated spell work&#8230;My trunk would contain more books than clothes, so that when I wore the school robes, they&#8217;d always give off a distinct odor of ancient leather bindings and crumbling pages. I&#8217;d have an owl for a pet, because I would know that practically they&#8217;re good for sending messages. I&#8217;d be conversing with brainy wizards all across the world, and probably also Lord Voldemort.\u00a0Because\u00a0even though I would fear him, I&#8217;d still envy his mental prowess and want to know his secrets. My raw intellect would sideline any emotional or fearful feelings I&#8217;d be the crazy girl hiding in the bathroom trying to divide my soul into eight pieces&#8230;oh and my best friend would be a piece of parchment on which I&#8217;d have written &#8216;Nerds are people too.&#8217;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>BLUBBER&#8230;GRYFFINDOR:</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img id=\"i-2237\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/gryffindor.jpg?w=167&#038;h=203\" width=\"167\" height=\"203\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Realistically, I don&#8217;t think I could be in Gryffindor, because I get scared just calling the electrician. I&#8217;d love to be fearless though. So, dream commence. After being sorted into Gryffindor, I&#8217;d swagger, yes,\u00a0<em>swagger\u00a0</em>over to the red and gold lathered table and introduce myself as the greatest being that ever walked on this planet. Haha no, I&#8217;d never do that&#8230;a bit too show offy for my taste. Instead of bothering to speak, I&#8217;d just whip out the custom made placard bearing my name and details out of my robes and display it round. Ha. Being a Gryffindor, I could\u00a0continuously\u00a0flout the rules and still get points. I&#8217;d smash a bathroom stall and then receive 50 points from McGonagall because I&#8217;d have saved the school from faulty plumbing, or something. As a Gryffindor I&#8217;d be able to do whatever I wanted, and have other people label me &#8216;fearless&#8217;. Oh, and I&#8217;d probably get myself one of those realistic lion hats, like Luna had.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>ODDMENT&#8230;SLYTHERIN:</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img id=\"i-2238\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/tumblr_lpb5p5j7eu1qghwau.jpg?w=178&#038;h=202\" width=\"178\" height=\"202\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Oh my my&#8230;look who&#8217;s walking by. Straight shiny black hair with a streak here and there, a pronounced lilting walk and heavy black eyes. Tight clothes, check. Red lipstick, check. A completely\u00a0<em>bitchy\u00a0</em>attitude. Triple check. Yeah, being in Slytherin, I&#8217;d be an arrogant, God complex ridden, probably pureblood witch. Pun intended. I&#8217;d wear silver and green and constantly say things like &#8220;Uh-huh, you can&#8217;t talk to me. You&#8217;re a muggle.&#8221;, or &#8220;Move away, you half breed.&#8221; I&#8217;d be a nuisance, a pedigree and Lord Voldemort would be on my speed dial. I&#8217;d buy my robes at weirdo places normal people don&#8217;t go to, because I&#8217;d have family money. Like the Gryffindors, I&#8217;d be able to break the rules and get away with it, but only because the teachers would be too\u00a0scared\u00a0of my important Ministry employed father, or my best pal Nagini. I wouldn&#8217;t study, but practice dark magic and turn people inside out for fun. Shudder.

The reject table in the metaphorical\u00a0cafeteria\u00a0of life. The nobodies. The invisibles. Okay so it&#8217;s not as bad as that. If I was sorted into Hufflepuff, my IQ would probably be below par. I&#8217;d have a\u00a0<em>fluffly\u00a0</em>name, something like &#8216;Softpalm&#8217;, &#8216;Fizzywinkle&#8217;, or the everlasting &#8216;Diggory.&#8217; People would make fun of me in the hallways. I&#8217;d have some courage, but it would all be covered up by my various layers of fat. I&#8217;d wear the badger bearing crest on my chest proudly and would mistakenly think it makes me worth something. I&#8217;m not biased, but to get sorted into a house with the word\u00a0<em>puff\u00a0</em>in the name&#8230;not a blessing. I&#8217;d be one of those people who&#8217;d spend Saturday nights at their grandparents&#8217; house baking cookies. Intellectual pursuits would make me shiver and I&#8217;d paint and sketch my friends&#8217; faces everywhere to remind myself of their existence. It would take me years to just master &#8216;Wingardium Leviosa&#8217; and I&#8217;d do really stupid things like fly backwards on my broom. And I&#8217;d own a toad, because I&#8217;d be too skittish to buy a dangerous or badass looking pet. Yellow is the colour of sunshine, but also of jaundice and vomit.

I mean, what&#8217;s the point of going to Germany and not seeing Berlin? So, no cash and no nom noms? I&#8217;d wander around the streets, wringing my hands, trying to attract notice. I&#8217;d do this and make sufficient signs and gestures, making my point clear: I need directions to the Berlin Wall. So, after finding my way to the Wall, I&#8217;d open my hair, ruffle up my clothes, and start shrieking, leaning against the Wall.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img id=\"i-2302\" class=\" wp-image aligncenter\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/germany-berlin-wall.jpg?w=284&#038;h=227\" height=\"227\" width=\"284\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">When I&#8217;d gather a proper sized audience, I&#8217;d make actions showing that I&#8217;m trying to marry the Wall, that i&#8217;m passionately in love with it and ultimately, that I&#8217;m insane. Hereafter, some medical\u00a0professionals\u00a0would be called and would carry me away kicking and screaming. In the asylum, I&#8217;d find at least\u00a0<em>one\u00a0</em>doctor who would speak\u00a0English\u00a0 Then I would explain my situation and would be taken care of&#8230;On the other hand, they might just lock me up on account of the fact that I tried to hook up with a national monument, but semantics. Ehh.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>SCENARIO #2: STRANDED IN FINLAND</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Ahh, Finland. The place where the percentage of high school graduates is 93 percent. Westernized,\u00a0civilized, educated country. And I&#8217;m stranded in it. I love the education system there: no homework, no heavy study load. Anyway, even though I&#8217;d have no money or food, I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;d have a fur coat, to survive the snow there.

His flawless features, blond hair, perfect lazy (bitchy) smile and oh, angel wings. Also, his unfortunate non existence.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">I&#8217;ve read a couple of swooning romances that fall under the new popular category of &#8216;Fallen Angel&#8217; fiction&#8230; <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6339664-hush-hush\" target=\"_blank\">Hush, Hush</a> by Becca Fitzpatrick and <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6487308-fallen\" target=\"_blank\">Fallen</a> by Lauren Kate, among others. And I&#8217;ve seen a pattern&#8230;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>ELEMENT #1: WHY IS THAT BOY WEARING LIPSTICK?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">The &#8216;different&#8217;, androgynous heroine. For some strange reason, these female leads are never very feminine. Rather, the adversaries they face (villainous\u00a0angels, ex girlfriends, supermodels) are gorgeous and perfect and super girly. And yet the guy chooses this unattractive self conscious girl and\u00a0promptly\u00a0pronounces her perfect and above all other mortals&#8230;I have a question. Is the hero secretly a homosexual? Is he tired of dating actual girls, and now wants to experiment with slightly mannish greasy haired, baggy jeans and sweatshirt wearing specimens?\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>ELEMENT #2:</strong><span style=\"line-height:14px;\">\u00a0<strong>THE LOVE TRIANGLE</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Okay, so the scraggly unkempt hair band wearing heroine apparently has enough charm and awkward personality to capture the main man, fine. We can go with that.\u00a0<em>However,\u00a0</em>how in the world do her plain looks and trillion insecurities manage to attract <em>another</em> suitor? One who keeps telling her how &#8216;fragile, luminescent and perfect&#8217; she is? Furthermore, this other\u00a0genetically\u00a0flawless guy seems intent on pursuing her no matter what, and has no pride or ego. Basically, the authors make all pubescent teenage girls believe that they are also worthy of dramatic love lives no matter how unwaxed their eyebrows are&#8230;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>ELEMENT #3: THE DOORMAT INSTINCT</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Alright, so I understand being involved in a love triangle, and being chased by another guy. Hey, it happens when you&#8217;re in a small community and only have two friends. Okay, but why does the heroine have to possess the lovely woolly flexible qualities of a door mat? Why can she not tell the other guy to just back off? Hell no, she&#8217;ll allow him to steal kisses and touch her inappropriately, but she&#8217;ll never make him leave. Because apparently she&#8217;s just\u00a0<em>too nice to say no,\u00a0</em>and second. she likes the attention she gets; it makes her feel like she&#8217;s worth something. So in the end, its the romance that matters, and not the ultimate Heavenly mission she&#8217;s on&#8230;\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>ELEMENT #4:</strong><span style=\"line-height:14px;\">\u00a0<strong>THE LONE WOLF</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">After the budding romance has fully blossomed and the pair are an official &#8216;thing&#8217;, you see the heroine&#8217;s other life melt away. Gone are the girlfriends, gossiping on the phone and sleep overs. Instead, the guy becomes the focal point of her existence. She shares everything with him, from secret thoughts to questions to insecurities. While that&#8217;s sweet and personal, one does wonder why she doesn&#8217;t have ANY NORMAL FRIENDS! Girls don&#8217;t like her because she stole the man of their dreams, and other guys can&#8217;t be her friends because they all fall in love with her&#8230;is this really the shallow life of the average American girl? I really hope not.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">In the end, I can see that all these fantastical romances are the author&#8217;s way of handing out dreams of love triangles and lots of male attention to awkward teenage girls, of which exist one too many.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img class=\" wp-image aligncenter\" id=\"i-2398\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/fallen-angel1.jpg?w=341&#038;h=213\" width=\"341\" height=\"213\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">The authors paints a perfect vision, and teenagers read it over and over in hopes of dreaming.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">&#8230;&#8217;tis a vicious cycle, and a devious plot.</p>\n", "post_id": 2384, "location": false, "date": "04-13-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["heaven", "humor", "postaday", "fallen angels", "random", "fiction", "top stories", "books", "supernatural", "writing", "love", "reading"], "text": "<p style=\"text-align:center;\">My last post was all about romance novels in the \u2018Fallen Angel\u2019 category; quite a bitter little post I must admit.

To say, she\u2019d have a whole white wing as fresh as morning glory, but the other one would be a stub. Yeah, she\u2019d be wing disabled. And why not? There are books written about perfectly perfect immortals who have flawless everything; well this one won\u2019t. So basically this girl would be amazing and stunning but when she\u2019d try to fly, she\u2019d wobble and fall to one side. She would never be able to ride a bike either, because of balance issues.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img id=\"i-2401\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/w3rdbqmtm3-10.png?w=232&#038;h=194\" width=\"232\" height=\"194\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">The main fallen angel hot guy would look down at the disabled girl and sneer down his paper sharp nose. The girl would instead have to charm him with her quirky ways and cute smile and of course, competent brain. The guy would then call her intelligent and not just \u201c<i>so so pretty and fragile.\u201d\u00a0</i>It would be a gritty real love story with a supernatural destiny and not just the romantic mushy stuff.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Wouldn&#8217;t\u00a0this plot be more fun than regular two-guys-one-girl dramas?</p>\n", "post_id": 2402, "location": false, "date": "04-14-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["life", "humor", "personal", "postaday", "celebrities", "lists", "writing", "top stories", "love", "blogging"], "text": "<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://dailypost.wordpress.com/2013/04/14/daily-prompt-list/\" target=\"_blank\">The &#8216;I Am Sort of Weird&#8217; List:</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Basically, I&#8217;m different from a lot of people my age, and here&#8217;s how.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"line-height:14px;\"><strong>I love love LOVE broccoli.</strong>\u00a0With cheese, without, steamed, boiled, mushy, anything.</span></li>\n<li><strong>I don&#8217;t like Ryan Gosling.</strong> Repeat.

What can I say? The book had me shivering and jumping around at every tiny sound like a squirrel with its tail on fire. I could not put it down, and at the same time I couldn&#8217;t read it through either. Few books have scared me, but this one came out of nowhere, just an innocent looking book, and it packed a terrifying punch. But the point is, how do you get through the after impact of a horror novel, or film?</p>\n<p>The answer? A few steps&#8230;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>After I watched Insidious, I was scared of <em>everything. </em>Closets, doors, even the ceiling, you name it. And so, I found comfort in my pet cat Coco. Step one: <em><strong>Keep your pet near you at all times. Failure will result in a random ghost attacking you from behind the kitchen door.</strong></em></li>\n<li>Alright. Where is the one place all horror movies usually center around? The bathroom. After watching/reading a horrific tale, you might be too frightened to venture into the terrifying world of tiles, glass and mirrors&#8230;is that even your own reflection looking back at you? So step number two: <strong><em>Have a sibling/friend stand outside the door giving constant reassurances while you pee.</em> </strong>Now, this is ONLY if you&#8217;re really really scared out of your wits. My sister does this for me. Oh, and if you happen to have an outhouse, find a really really loyal companion to brave the cold <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)</span>.</li>\n<li>Think you can hear someone walking behind you? Tiny shuffling footsteps scraping on the carpet? Someone standing behind you even as you&#8217;re reading this post? They probably are there&#8230;but no need to jump out of your skin. Step number three: <em><strong>Keep glancing back over your shoulder at intervals of three minutes apart.</strong></em>Now this might seem ridiculous, but come on, that spirit behind you isn&#8217;t going to vanish itself!</li>\n<li>You&#8217;re walking over to turn off the lights in the back porch, or the garage and the dark garden looms before you like a cemetery with eerie lights. You get scared, breathe heavily. Step number four: <em><strong>RUN. As fast as you can, without stumbling or falling (like people in movies).</strong></em>If it is a ghost, it&#8217;ll probably appear as soon as you get your sprinting self into your bedroom, but give it a run for its money anyway. No pun intended.</li>\n<li>Unlike the actors in movies, if you DO find a spirit lurking in the dark corners of your bedroom, don&#8217;t ask it stupid things like &#8220;What do you want?&#8221; &#8220;Who are you?&#8221; etc.. If it wanted to tell you things, it would have given you a friendship bracelet instead of stalking you like Nicki Minaj does green wigs. So instead, have a conversation..step number five: <em><strong>Develop a refined sense of humour that pleases natural and supernatural beings alike so they don&#8217;t want to slash your brains out anymore.</strong></em></li>\n<li>And finally, pick a magic place. That&#8217;s right, you&#8217;ve discovered my true age. I am four. No really, when I was younger, I had a firm belief that my bed and the quilt on it were magical safety spots and nothing could get me there. So step number six: <em><strong>Claim a magic safe place and stick to it.</strong></em>This will save you lots of scares, although it might get you into trouble with your therapist&#8230;but not all of us are Lindsay Lohan, now are we?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Six fool-proof steps to getting through the impact of a horror movie/book with virtually no side effects.

However, now that I&#8217;m older, I&#8217;m beginning to see <a href=\"http://dailypost.wordpress.com/2013/04/14/daily-prompt-list/\" target=\"_blank\">those movies</a> in a new light&#8230;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>5. ALICE IN WONDERLAND (1951)</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">So, Alice takes a trip down a magical hole, chasing after a white rabbit that&#8217;s wearing a tailcoat and pocket watch. And after the whole fiasco ends, she wakes up and realizes its a dream? Yeah right. <strong>More like LSD</strong>. I&#8217;m so sure that instead of just having an overactive imagination, Alice smoked some mind warping drugs and went on a bender. That has to explain the weird characters, and especially the Queen of Hearts, who was about as gentle with her husband as a Black Widow spider. Also, she appeared to have several gender related issues.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img id=\"i-2441\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/disney-alice-in-wonderland-wallpaper.jpg?w=292&#038;h=219\" width=\"292\" height=\"219\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Oh and the caterpillar was definitely smoking some sort of hash to be that creepy. The whole film was a colourful bright and entirely drug drenched affair.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>4. TARZAN (1999)</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">When I saw this film again, I was struck with some very alarming thoughts. Tarzan,\u00a0raised\u00a0by apes lives in a jungle and wears a tiny loincloth. Plausible, yes. The perfect 8 pack, also plausible.\u00a0However\u00a0when Jane meets him, and falls in love, it&#8217;s clear what has happened. She&#8217;s from a typical British background, and was raised to sip tea and make polite quips about curtain fabric etc. Meeting Tarzan, it&#8217;s obvious she finds his primitive and rugged form quite alluring and &#8216;falls in love.&#8217; Really? She gives up her dresses and bone china tea sets and settles down with a smelly jungle man who can&#8217;t even speak the same language? Talk about cultural barriers&#8230;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img class=\" wp-image aligncenter\" id=\"i-2443\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/tarzan-disney-14686159-1024-768.jpg?w=292&#038;h=219\" width=\"292\" height=\"219\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Also, HOW is Tarzan perfectly unshaven? Creepy. And lastly, what will Jane do when she gets her period in the jungle? Ape made tampons..?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>3. PINOCCHIO (1940)</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Hmm. I have just one main concern with this film. And that is the sheer disturbing fact of Pinocchio&#8217;s existence. Geppetto ails for a son, and so builds a wooden one? Umm, how does that add up? The normal\u00a0process\u00a0of procreation involves a man and a woman, and babies. Or has\u00a0life\u00a0taught me wrong? Because Geppetto here, instead of looking for a wife to have a son with, makes up a wooden version and then what? Waits for a miracle to bring him to life? Is Geppetto gay? Because as far as I&#8217;m concerned, he\u00a0constructs\u00a0a\u00a0wooden\u00a0doll and\u00a0spends\u00a0all day talking to him, just\u00a0waiting\u00a0for a fairy to show up&#8230;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2451\" alt=\"Pinocchio-Wallpaper-classic-disney-6432480-1024-768\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/pinocchio-wallpaper-classic-disney-6432480-1024-768.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Once Pinocchio becomes a &#8216;real boy&#8217;, he travels all over town with a cricket, just so he can learn how not to lie? Conquering one of the deadly sins is laudable but why is that the focal point of the film? Is there nothing else left in his life?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>2. SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARVES (1937)</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Alright, so I understand and can go along with the film to some extent. Evil stepmother hates pretty stepdaughter and wants her killed because of her own insecurity. Huntsman softens and lets the girl escape. Okay, then it gets strange. Snow White promptly finds a random cottage and cleans it&#8230;obsessive tendencies much? Moreover, she lives with and keeps house for seven dwarves&#8230;\u00a0Inasmuch\u00a0as there was a pastoral state of innocence, she stays with seven men and that too, quite cheerfully.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2452\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/snowwhite6.gif?w=300&#038;h=235\" width=\"300\" height=\"235\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">As if this wasn&#8217;t disturbing enough, the Queen transforms herself into an old hag and shows up at the cottage, offering Snow White a shiny red apple, a piece of which gets stuck in her throat, causing her death. Umm, Satan anyone? And the forbidden fruit? A loved Disney classic\u00a0basically\u00a0retells Adam&#8217;s fall from Heaven, with Snow White as Eve. Why are there scary Biblical images in a kids&#8217; movie? Lastly, the Prince shows up and rescues his princess. He does two things. One, he saves her from dying, and two, he saves her from having a permanent Adam&#8217;s Apple, and becoming a man&#8230;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>1. HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME (1996)</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">There is a reason why this film disturbed me. It wasn&#8217;t made for children. Claude Frodo, a\u00a0lecherous\u00a0 debauched priest was certainly not your average run of the mill kids&#8217;\u00a0villain. What made me uneasy was the expression on his face&#8230;his eyes screamed RAPE in every scene of the film. I will address this issue in a moment.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">But first, Quasimodo. I&#8217;m certain that watching a hunchback who lives in a bell tower and is most certainly schizophrenic (the talking to gargoyles bit) is not healthy for children of any age. A child will get depressed at the morbid imagery and life story of the character.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2453\" alt=\"Judge-Claude-Frollo-walt-disney-characters-21061226-1276-683\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/judge-claude-frollo-walt-disney-characters-21061226-1276-683.jpg?w=300&#038;h=160\" width=\"300\" height=\"160\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Back to Frodo. When he sees Esmeralda, who&#8217;s made out to be a gypsy, there is a whole musical number about how evil and wicked she is.

My mother, who stressed out at the sight of the little bundle of fur, and told me to throw it out since we already owned a rather haughty cat. That just broke my heart and obviously I couldn&#8217;t turn it out on the streets like a little waif, so I began making calls to all my nearest friends and family, imploring them to take in the little orphan. 23 phone calls later, and I had no success to show.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, I had christened the kitty &#8220;Mr. Finkles&#8221; in complete following of the stereotypical &#8216;girls\u00a0naming\u00a0pets froo froo names&#8217;, and was playing with it happily. I hoped I could somehow keep it, but that was not possible, which was tragic. Finally, I turned to desperate remedies and made a call to the last person I would ever ask, my cousin. Lets call him J. My last hope waning, I crossed my fingers, only to find that J flat out refused and couldn&#8217;t take responsibility for the kitten because of permission problems from his parents. That was it. I would have to give the kitten away after all.</p>\n<p>My master plan was, that J would take care of Mr. Finkles for about a month, until my own cat had her babies, and then I could just smuggle the kitten back in. However, he again refused, saying he couldn&#8217;t, so I had to give it away. My cousin called the next day, asking for the kitten to keep her two little daughters company. &#8230;\u00a0disastrous\u00a0results ensued. The little girls positively twisted and nearly strangled the kitten while attempting to show affection! Needless to say I cried, but I couldn&#8217;t renege on my promise now could I?</p>\n<p>Mr. Finkles is with them now, and has been re named Pennington.

The dark blue almost bruised looking dark circles she had acquired weren&#8217;t doing her complexion any favours but the worst was still to be seen. She tentatively looked towards her eyebrows and groaned inwardly: they had grown into a miniature forest. What with reunions and dropping her children off to school and wand practice, she had forgotten to get threaded. And horror of horrors, she had a brownish line of fuzz on her upper lip that needed to be dealt with, not by magic, but hot wax. She felt masculine and awkward, and knew her trip to the salon had been put off too long.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Pulling off the bed clothes, she looked down, expecting to see spotless sheets, and found a reddish smear. No, no,\u00a0<em>no,\u00a0</em>she thought. Not\u00a0<em>today!\u00a0</em>Now she&#8217;d have to stop by the store and pick up some tampons, and she already felt like a fuzzy mess. This day\u00a0was\u00a0getting worse by the second, and when she left the house, she didn&#8217;t even bother with make up.

You will see the drive to learn, to get educated. And you will also see the non existent funds available for free education. She was 6\u00a0years\u00a0old when she started working to support her family,\u00a0because\u00a0her brothers both died from typhoid. What\u00a0hospitals\u00a0would treat them?

Whatever the case here, I\u2019ve decided to sit down and invite my memories to tea, in hopes of nostalgic conversation.</p>\n<p>The one strong memory that comes forth sings of a foreign land, of earth beneath my feet that felt alien and familiar at the same time. It reminds me wistfully of a December morning when I stood toeing the line that divides my country and <b>no man\u2019s land</b>. And I was thinking that surely, this was a <i>girl thing, </i>that men just weren\u2019t allowed there in that strip of red earth and wasn\u2019t that just <i>something</i>? I was also eleven years old and an idiot. We walked over that line, stepping over manmade borders to <b>India</b>, the land of <i>masala chai, Shahrukh Khan and Bollywood dreams. </i>I thought the earth would move, or someone would spontaneously burst into song, but none of that ensued. We simply walked over into another country and\u2026took a bus. How is it that you step into another world, and don\u2019t pause to think; this is another country, and the heart that beats in it isn\u2019t the same? However at the time I recall thinking about how cold it was and that I should\u2019ve worn the extra sweater mom had asked me to wear, even if it <i>was </i>brown and gross.</p>\n<p>So we took the bus to Amritsar, and ended up in these tiny twisting streets. The one thing I remember about Amritsar was the sound of it: the clatters and yells and barks. Needless to say it was sort of a blur, what with me being shy and not deigning to look out of the bus window, less someone spotted me and yelled \u201cPakistani!\u201d I was a stranger, and yet I felt like I had lived here all my life. I hadn\u2019t gone to India alone; we were a group of people, and the ratio of guys to girls was unfairly portioned out, with way more boys than girls. Even as a child, I always got on better with guys; girls had a whole dramatic side to them I didn\u2019t quite understand. Boys were easy, boys were transparent. If he liked you, he\u2019d punch you on the arm or throw a pebble at you. Not like girls, with their snide whispers and fake-shy looks. So I made friends\u2026in a way. In my way.</p>\n<p><img class=\" wp-image alignleft\" id=\"i-2598\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/taj-mahal-india-taj-mahal-720x1280.jpg?w=292&#038;h=164\" width=\"292\" height=\"164\" /></p>\n<p>And what sits patiently waiting at the fuzziest edges of my memory is our trip to the Taj Mahal, in Agra. I remember feeling not so well, and ignoring my body\u2019s warning signs to the fever that would soon spread. Instead, I took off my shoes like everyone else, and walked on the slick, freezing marble that makes up the monument, looking about me in a dazed way, as if there was too much and I couldn\u2019t take it in. At one point, we stood underneath a tree that I thought was covered with brown dead leaves, and I felt sorry for it. However, an aged Sikh man pointed out that the \u2018leaves\u2019 were sparrows and I was looking at them open mouthedly, like the most na\u00efve child in the world. I (no other word for it) freaked when they all flew away, and remember thinking that inanimate things might be alive, and I just hadn\u2019t noticed them and maybe all of India was like this: surprises layered on surprises. And living breathing life had been hidden to look like dead rotting leaves. It was a most confusing thought, and I left it at that. I also got a high fever after that, which caused me to sleep with my mouth open, so there you go.

I wasn&#8217;t initially going to vote, but a friend changed my mind by saying my vote would just go wasted and I should feel more responsible towards my country.\u00a0<em><br />\n</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">On the TV, some old man with an impressive beard was talking about &#8220;swing voters.&#8221; Explanation: People who keep oscillating between political parties and\u00a0don&#8217;t\u00a0know where their loyalties lie, even to the time of giving in their vote&#8230;that was me.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">My enthusiastic Imran Khan supporting mom and I, her sullen brooding child drove over to our polling station. On the way I did notice a few things. For one, the shiny apple red Metro Bus that runs in the city. I saw the gleaming stations, the walkways, the signs, and the people to whom such a system must be a luxury, preferable to walking on hot summer days that Lahore is too generously endowed with. I started to think. Voting for Nawaz Sharif might not be a bad idea, would it? He solved a major transport problem, after all.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img class=\" wp-image aligncenter\" id=\"i-2675\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/happynewyear.jpg?w=292&#038;h=219\" width=\"292\" height=\"219\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Further on, I saw a gleaming back jeep sporting four PTI flags, and also happened to notice (no blame here), the extremely cute guy driving it. So then I reasoned, Imran Khan had somehow motivated the complacent &#8216;young people&#8217; of Pakistan to get up at 8 am, and go cast their votes. The voters for PTI generally seemed more sophisticated, educated, tea drinking and\u00a0Ray-Ban(s)\u00a0wearing people. Plus, the supporters for PML-N seemed not to know the difference between a tiger (their actual mascot) and all varieties of cheetahs, lions and cougars&#8230;My vote fluctuated back to Imran Khan and his red and green\u00a0campaign.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img class=\" wp-image aligncenter\" id=\"i-2670\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/pti_lpic-2312.jpg?w=323&#038;h=150\" width=\"323\" height=\"150\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">When we finally got to the heart of the city, three police trucks lined up in front of the car,\u00a0chock full\u00a0of barbed wire, bats and some particularly vicious looking policemen. Added to the fact that there had been bomb threats by the Taliban threatening to stop the\u00a0elections, I got properly frightened. What kind of country was I in, where democracy was thought to be the enemy?\u00a0Therein, I\u00a0decided not to vote at all.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">When we finally reached the polling station, I saw the vote casting sheet and spied a really cute ostrich symbol. I didn&#8217;t even know which party it belonged to, but I thought it looked adorable and thought of stamping on it. However, after all was said and done, and I was standing\u00a0behind\u00a0the flimsy cardboard cutout that was the &#8216;polling booth&#8217;, I\u00a0realized\u00a0I was\u00a0just exhausted\u00a0 Tired out from the constant shifts, tired of my parents supporting different parties, and people telling me what to do. I thought about it for two seconds. The Metro Bus wasn&#8217;t a solution &#8211; it was a\u00a0band-aid.\u00a0Pakistan needed more vital things. Imran Khan was willing to address the core issues, the ones that mattered.

I happened to walk in there some days ago, armed with a heavy <i>dupatta</i>, from head to toe. The reason? To throw off the leering stares of the shopkeepers and other assorted passersby of the male variety. Azaan had just rung fresh in my ears; these men went to pray, and returned to their stalls and shops to ogle female shoppers. This seemingly random event made me realize one of the issues looming before my world, and to some extent, the world in general: the misrepresentation of Islam. It is herein my firm belief that people and their actions are what produce these misconceptions; my religion does not encourage such behavior, let alone even allow it.</p>\n<p>I have collected quite a few lurid comments from various sources about how Islam \u2018allows\u2019 its men to virtually dominate over the women, as if they had no rights. These opinions have not been formed on fact; rather they are a portrayal of the way my religion has been misrepresented by the very people who profess to follow it. Men who pray and then leer at passing women will never inspire positive views about the religion they follow. This is not Islamic teaching; in a Hadith it is mentioned:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\u201c<strong>Fear Allah in respect of women.</strong><strong>\u201d</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Clearly, despite being an Islamic state, my own people are presenting an altered view of Islam to the world.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The issue with Islam being called violently sexist is expanded by a recent incident that occurred. A Swati girl, Malala Yousafzai</strong>, merely fourteen years old, was shot at point blank range. Her crime: <b>promoting women\u2019s education. </b>Extremists who call themselves pure Muslims fatally harmed an innocent girl over something that is fully permitted in Islam. This is the crux of this essay; Islam as a religion is misrepresented as not wanting females to be progressively educated. I stress, it is the people who have spread this misconception. This can effectively be proven by the fact that the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH)\u2019s first wife, Hazrat Khadija was a merchant who traded on her own, while his second, Hazrat Aisha was a scholar, and even led an army in battle. To Muslims, the Prophet (PBUH) is the veritable example of perfection; so why would we stop women from learning?</p>\n<p>An Anti-Islam YouTube video, showing it to be a brutal religion was put up, which clearly illustrated what the world perceives Islam as. Yes, there is violence that exists, in Pakistan, among Muslims. Shiites and Sunnis, two prominent sects, feud constantly. However, I would like to point out that Islam did not create these divisions, people themselves did. They tyrannize and fight, but Islam itself does not.</p>\n<p>Overall, Islam is being misrepresented as a religion that persecutes without reason, has no respect for women or their education, and more besides. These are not true claims. All religions deserve to be respected because they provide foundation and people deviate from it, giving rise to several fallacies about the religion itself.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">So I can&#8217;t stress this enough. I realize the impression Muslims have made on the rest of the world. But please don&#8217;t think all of us are one and the same. \u00a0Our religion does not allow violence and dispute. It never has. Its the people who have fallen. Not Islam.</p>\n", "post_id": 266, "location": false, "date": "11-21-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["postaday", "humor", "mexico", "horror", "random", "writing", "top stories", "isla de las munecas", "island of the dolls", "travel"], "text": "<p style=\"text-align:center;\">I had writer&#8217;s block.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">So terribly that whenever I scribbled a single word onto a page, I wouldn&#8217;t be able to justify its existence.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Then today I found out something eerie, and I had to write about it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong></strong><span style=\"color:#93992d;font-family:Georgia;\">Isla de las Munecas</span></p>\n<p>Ahan, the <strong>Island of the Dolls</strong>. It&#8217;s a small island, a &#8216;floating garden&#8217; really, located just South of Mexico City. There&#8217;s a legend about the tiny land, which basically states that: There once lived a happy caretaker on the island named Don Julian Barrera. <img class=\" wp-image alignright\" id=\"i-2695\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/el-senor-julian-santana-barrera.jpg?w=153&#038;h=231\" width=\"153\" height=\"231\" />\u00a0It isn&#8217;t clear how many other people lived there, I&#8217;m assuming the legend doesn&#8217;t concern itself with eye witnesses or anything real. So, one day Barrera saw a little girl drowning in the river. He ran to save her, but it was too late and she sank heavy into the depths below.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Barrera was consumed with regret at seeing such a loss of human life. Another fine day (there seemed to be many), he found a doll floating in the river the girl drowned in. Lonely and old, he fished it out, believing it to be the spirit of the girl who had died there. Umm, yeah.</p>\n<p><img class=\" wp-image alignleft\" id=\"i-2698\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/isla-de-las-munecas-photos.jpg?w=354&#038;h=184\" width=\"354\" height=\"184\" /></p>\n<p>From then on, he continued to (it is unclear why) litter the island with tens of dolls, placing some in trees, some on the ground, until it looked like an incredibly gruesome tea party. He believed all the dolls carried spirits of dead little girls. Probably wasn&#8217;t in the best frame of mind, I&#8217;m guessing. It&#8217;s not clear whether he made these dolls or just happened to come across random ones floating in the river. In any case, to this day there are hundreds of dolls on the island, some with no eyes, some with no limbs, and all with a putrid aura of death and torture.\u00a0<img class=\" wp-image alignright\" id=\"i-2703\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/dolls-isla-de-las-munecas.jpg?w=354&#038;h=266\" width=\"354\" height=\"266\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Basically, the guide and the boatman who take you there (God knows if you ever want to go), frighten you off the bat by hinting they might leave you stranded there overnight. And then\u00a0of course\u00a0you fall for the bait because you don&#8217;t want to spend all night staring into lifeless glazed blue eyes or having plastic arms and feet touch you everywhere.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">For the record, it&#8217;s become a tourist destination for those interested in other realms, and morbidity fanatics. Commercially, many people make money off of the\u00a0spirits\u00a0of the little girls trapped in their plastic shells.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">For a minute, if one were to imagine there were actually spirits possessing these dolls, of all the little Mexican girls who had died in unfortunate circumstances, well then.

On this day, when I was still cocooned, blissfully ignorant, in the encompassing safety of my mother&#8217;s womb, around 7 people lost their lives in the city. Lahore was like an oven left on high, the baker gone off to tend his herb garden and feed his chickens, while his bread blackened.\u00a0</p>\n<p>My father, at the time worked as a division head for the electric company; there had been power outages for five days across the city, with more than one city wide blackout. He said people had their hands permanently uplifted, praying for wind, rain, relief.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dad wasn&#8217;t at the hospital with my mother; there was a problem at the grid station, and he had to oversee it. He said right around six o clock, just as the sun was starting its descent, oblivious to the fire it had raged in the country, an eerie calm set in. The sky lost its golden sheen, and as every minute ticked by, it started to look less like molten metal, and more like the slick side of a cool aluminium sheet. For ten minutes, the world stopped. People stopped praying, leaves stopped whispering, the earth stopped crackling, just to look up.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And then the sky split open.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You&#8217;d think it was raining quicksilver and not water, the way people reacted. Some cried out of sheer relief, some danced in the streets, and the dust just didn&#8217;t settle. No one settled. As elections and cricket, that day rain was something to shout about. Lahore became one loud heartbeat, an uplifted face towards the sky.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img class=\" wp-image aligncenter\" id=\"i-2763\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/westghats_india_monsoon.jpg?w=390&#038;h=293\" width=\"390\" height=\"293\" /></p>\n<p>Seven o clock: the city found that the blessing they had plead for had a few tricks up its sleeve. As my mom went into labour in the hospital, my dad narrowly escaped being crushed by a lightning struck tree on Mall Road. The aged, sinuous tree was zapped at the base; its charred trunk made metal sheets out of the two cars it landed on.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Well, monsoon arrived in blazing fury and massive strength.</p>\n<p>Eight o clock. I was due to arrive, pink and mute into the world sometime in the next half hour. And then the city blacked out. My dad panicked, got into his car again. I don&#8217;t know how, but with Herculean strength and steely patience, he got the district&#8217;s power back. The hospital still remembers him for that act to this day. The way I see it, he saved tens of lives that night.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And so, I was born. A booming clap of thunder greeted me, I think I cried along to it. That day, the rain that poured down in buckets was a blessing, and a calamity. It gave life, it took it away. It made some hearts sing, it silenced some forever.\u00a0</p>\n<p>What I do know is, being born to a torrential downpour, I live for the rain.

You may just like this list.</p>\n<p>Firstly, you don&#8217;t have a uni brow anymore (Hurrah ladies and gentlemen!).. That got waxed and threaded and plucked along with your upper lip, arms and several other things. Quite frankly you should be happy; you were beginning to resemble a little gorilla *horrified*.</p>\n<p>That being said, you know that addiction you have to drinking Coke? And how you pump the stuff like a pro boxer pumps steroids,\u00a0absolutely\u00a0essential for survival? Yeah, you still do that. No, you have not made any &#8216;Eat Healthy and Organic&#8217; New Years&#8217; resolutions. You still don&#8217;t eat a lot of fruit and hate chanaas and okra. Some things just don&#8217;t change after all. Don&#8217;t worry, it hasn&#8217;t affected you the wrong way, in fact, your skin is much better than it used to be.</p>\n<p>Before you start rejoicing in all these happy events, let me just tell you, you don&#8217;t grow any taller than what you are right now. You will stay this tiny all your life, and four years later, your height is exactly the same. So give up your dreams of\u00a0suddenly\u00a0sprouting spidery long legs that any model would kill for. You&#8217;ll have to make do with your 5 foot 3 inches, and short stumpy legs.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">You still haven&#8217;t managed to finish reading The Lord Of The Rings.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><del>Be ashamed of yourself.</del></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">(Or not, because life&#8217;s too short to know what hobbits are up to :D)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">What else? OH! You know all those dreams you had about following a literary career and helping mankind by opening various animal shelters throughout the world? Yeah forget about that. You&#8217;ve decided to become a Business Major because you&#8217;ve discovered that the cold hard corporate world is your calling*. You still take in strays and waifs, but you&#8217;ve pragmatically decided not to make a career out of the hobby. Good for you!<strong>\u00a0*</strong>would have earned nothing otherwise, would you?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">And your updated bucket list? Here it is:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">1. Open the animal shelter you wanted on the side (some dreams just refuse to die).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">2. Keep a squirrel for a pet.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">3. Get spidery long legs somehow (leg extensions anyone?)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">4. Dye half your hair electric blue with green streaks thrown in (new addition here).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">5. Go on a Euro trip with your best friend.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">6. Live in an apartment with your best friend for a little while.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">7. Make a youtube video.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">8. Attain a carefully dry and cutting, yet gently mocking sense of humour.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">And then there are those things too embarrassing to mention. But the point is that you have grown up, contrary to your belief that you wouldn&#8217;t. Okay\u00a0that&#8217;s\u00a0a lie, <del>you still buy bubble guns, toys and candy. And listen to songs like &#8216;They&#8217;re Taking The Hobbits To Eisengard&#8217;&#8230;\u00a0</del>\u00a0 &lt;&#8212;&#8211; Unacceptable adult actions..</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Lastly, you are very very close to your little sister now, even though you fight a lot right now.

I&#8217;ll use an example button:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/ff.png?w=487\"><img class=\" wp-image aligncenter\" id=\"i-2942\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/ff.png?w=351&#038;h=179\" width=\"351\" height=\"179\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>STEP #3: UPLOAD TO PHOTOBUCKET</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Sorry if this is going painfully slow, but trust me, it&#8217;ll be worth it in the end. Anyway, now just open Photobucket and upload your button there. Once it&#8217;s uploaded, open the picture and copy the html code in the sidebar:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/ll.png?w=487\"><img class=\" wp-image aligncenter\" id=\"i-2951\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/ll.png?w=341&#038;h=195\" width=\"341\" height=\"195\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>STEP #4: OPEN NOTEPAD</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">This is simple.

That familiar white window, with one cracked pane that always creaks when it swings open. Those warm walls, spattered with paint, childish drawings, a testament to the destructive power of Crayola and chalk. Stone floors, which allowed you to walk over them, never complaining. The ceilings, carrying memories of laughter, grief, even scandal.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Home is the twilit garden where you sat and dreamed. Prayed for magic powers, then later, for money, fame, a cure for cancer.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">I&#8217;ve moved nine houses ever since I was a child.

They meet their fellow students with hugs, gushy emotional outbursts and loaded compliments. &#8220;Oh hi *insert name*, you look\u00a0<em>wonderful\u00a0</em>today! I&#8217;m so jealous of how your hair stays that perfect!&#8221; These\u00a0<strong>fakers\u00a0</strong>have no &#8216;best friends&#8217;, per se. They have a gathering of gaggling girls. The problem is, once they go off alone, the\u00a0<em>bitching\u00a0</em>begins. They critisize everyone and everything about everyone behind their backs. Oh, and these are the people who started the TBH trend online&#8230;just saying.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img class=\" wp-image aligncenter\" id=\"i-3167\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/3175172974_bf9ea7a9df.jpg?w=193&#038;h=267\" width=\"193\" height=\"267\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>Motto: &#8220;If they can&#8217;t hear it, it can&#8217;t hurt them.&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>2. THE POSERS&#8230;\u00a0</strong>*Flash*. These girls begin their day taking pictures of their bowls of cereal, the shoes they want to wear and the coffee stains on the smoked glass tabletop. When they meet their friends, they greet each other and immediately whip out their cameras. The\u00a0<strong>posers\u00a0</strong>spend their time studying the angles and planes of their faces, checking when the light catches the subtle lowlights in their hair. Every move they make is posed, and their lips are in permanent pout position. Even at funerals, and in bathrooms they manage to upload a few instaphotos&#8230;They don&#8217;t have actual friendships: none that take place away from behind the lens at least.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img class=\" wp-image aligncenter\" id=\"i-3179\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/6867061103_f873f08788_z.jpg?w=201&#038;h=300\" width=\"201\" height=\"300\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>MOTTO: &#8220;Say cheese, it&#8217;s the only fun we&#8217;ll have today!&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong></strong><strong>3. THE GOSSIPS&#8230;\u00a0</strong>Ahh, the most intriguing category. These are the girls with the know how, who know everyone and everyone knows them. A bit like the\u00a0<strong>fakers,\u00a0</strong>they make it their mission to worm into everyone&#8217;s life and fish out their dirty secrets. They&#8217;re usually busy with their cellphones, texting a hundred people at once, spreading gossip like the plague. &#8220;She did\u00a0<em>what\u00a0</em>with\u00a0<em>whom?!&#8221;\u00a0</em>Everything is their business, and they make ridiculous facebook pages like &#8220;<em>Who&#8217;s Dating Whom?&#8221;\u00a0</em>and &#8220;<em>Who&#8217;s Crushing On Whom?&#8221;\u00a0</em>They&#8217;ll have seen your profile picture, your ex&#8217;s profile picture and your sister&#8217;s best friend&#8217;s cat&#8217;s picture. These girls can give the CIA a run for their money; they resent other people&#8217;s happiness and spread news around to make up for the fact that their actual lives fall flat.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img class=\" wp-image aligncenter\" id=\"i-3190\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/talking.jpg?w=207&#038;h=216\" width=\"207\" height=\"216\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>MOTTO: &#8220;I already knew that!&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>4. THE MATCHMAKERS&#8230;\u00a0</strong>No two words about it, these girls are the modern day equivalent of bored old Victorian era dowagers. Like the\u00a0<strong>gossips,\u00a0</strong>they know everyone, but for entirely different purposes. These are the girls who&#8217;s so involved, personally with everyone&#8217;s lives that they take up the dreaded occupation of matchmaker. They will target you, ask you if you&#8217;re single. Then they&#8217;ll proceed to talk about their brother&#8217;s friend, or his friend&#8217;s cousin, or his friend&#8217;s cousin&#8217;s best friend, only to tell you how good you both will look together. Unlike the gossips and the fakers, these offline dating sites mean no harm. They&#8217;re only involved with your lives out of sheer boredom, and a lack of appreciation in childhood.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img class=\" wp-image aligncenter\" id=\"i-3200\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/original.jpg?w=203&#038;h=203\" width=\"203\" height=\"203\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>MOTTO: &#8220;So, tell me about yourself&#8230;&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>5. THE REPRESSED&#8230;\u00a0</strong>Okay, how do I approach this? These girls are happy when it&#8217;s an all girl group but bring in a guy, and they shrivel up. They cringe at the mention of boys, and visibly shudder if they ever have to go address a member of the male species. Their favourite words are &#8216;Ew, him?&#8217;. Now, this behaviour would be acceptable if these girls were merely conservative&#8230;but no. They are\u00a0<strong><em>repressed.</em>\u00a0</strong>Secretly, they envision having a hundred guy friends, making boys hang on to their every word, being flirty and witty and captivating. However, with their girlfriends, they lie and pretend boys are an affliction. Their true selves come out when they actually\u00a0<em>meet\u00a0</em>a boy. Then, it&#8217;s all smiles and compliments. These girls are desperate to gain male attention, and envy the girls who can carry it off. Their repression leads to destructive behaviour, and openly desperate attempts.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img class=\" wp-image aligncenter\" id=\"i-3210\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/mad-men-season-5-sezonul-5-wallpaper-4-peggy-joan.jpg?w=295&#038;h=197\" width=\"295\" height=\"197\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>MOTTO: &#8220;Boys are disgusting&#8230;in a wonderful way.&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>6. THE OBSESSED&#8230;\u00a0</strong>As should be obvious, these girls are the exact opposite of the\u00a0<strong>repressed.\u00a0</strong>They&#8217;re the ones who started caking on make up at fourteen, sneaking out to &#8216;parties&#8217; and mixers at 15, and making fools of themselves all throughout. These girls live to get male attention, and they make it overt. If they&#8217;re intelligent, they&#8217;ll pretend they&#8217;re stupid, they won&#8217;t like video games, and they&#8217;ll practise flirting in the mirror every night. They have a high tinkling laugh that&#8217;s meant to be feminine but sounds like glass shattering everytime it slips out. Every move is practised, and they hang out in groups. Before a guy, they&#8217;ll be soft-spoken, delicate, poised, but once the unfortunate suitor leaves, they&#8217;ll become themselves: whiny, annoying and mean. Drama is food to them, and bitchiness a mandatory gene.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img class=\" wp-image aligncenter\" id=\"i-3223\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/attention-whore-black-hair-demi-lovato-jean-shorts-push-up-slut-favim-com-76617_large.jpg?w=265&#038;h=198\" width=\"265\" height=\"198\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>MOTTO: &#8220;It&#8217;s a boy! Quick, put on your face!&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>7. THE GENUINES&#8230;\u00a0</strong>This is the rarest, and best category here. These girls are just\u00a0<em>real.\u00a0</em>They&#8217;re down to earth, and are at home with girls, guys, dolphins or polar bears. Conversations with them seem to last forever, because you can tell them how you really feel, about everything. These genuines are warm, caring and loving people with big hearts and wonderful attitudes. Far be it from them to bring you down; they keep your spirits up, and are blessings in the way of being your best friends. They can be loners, they can be social butterflies, but you&#8217;ll know when you meet one of these girls, because they&#8217;ll always have a\u00a0<em>genuine\u00a0</em>hug or compliment ready, and will make you feel comfortable and secure. These are the girls I have spent most of my time at school with, and yes, they&#8217;re one in a million.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img class=\" wp-image aligncenter\" id=\"i-3232\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/2019990129_friend_2_xlarge.jpeg?w=272&#038;h=226\" width=\"272\" height=\"226\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>MOTTO: &#8220;I care about you, truly.&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">So there you have it.

This to me was an appealing enough back cover, and I immediately dived into the book, which is\u00a0satisfyingly\u00a0fat, consisting of 562 pages, namely the book lover&#8217;s dream. Meggie, his daughter also possesses this gift but doesn&#8217;t find out until she and her father have been taken hostage by the bad guys. Pretty typical right?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Except for the fact that Meggie&#8217;s mother has disappeared into Inkheart, which is a book within the actual novel. The mystery surrounding her whereabouts is cleared at the very end, which basically makes the book pleasingly mysterious. Added to that, Dustfinger, a fire-eater who has been read out of his story by Mo, accompanies Meggie and Mo as they&#8217;re captured by the\u00a0villain\u00a0Capricorn. I found this an\u00a0interesting\u00a0choice for a name, and the reason behind it is satisfying enough. Now in the film, there are no hints to why he&#8217;s called what he is, but in the book, Funke indicates that his name compliments his actual star sign. Good to know his name wasn&#8217;t picked just because it\u00a0sounded\u00a0evil. Basis in fact is always refreshing.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Now that the actual plot of the story has been laid out, its time to compare. Film or book? I admit, Meggie&#8217;s character in the book is quite different from the one in the film. In the former, she is literally clingy to the point of being\u00a0unbearable\u00a0and gets jealous at the mention of her own mother. Albeit she is also much cleverer. The book however, stretches her emotional state to the point of being painful; the film sums it all up in a nice snappy 1 and a half hour screening. So as far as Meggie&#8217;s character and story line are concerned, the film executed it better.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Going on to Dustfinger, and Farid (read out of Arabian Nights), their histories and characteristics have been changed. In the film, Dustfinger is married and has a family and so wants to return to his world. However in the book, he could be married to Farid for all the time they spend together. He&#8217;s a bachelor and just doesn&#8217;t fit into the real world (but then, who&#8217;s to say what&#8217;s real?). The film wins here too, Dustfinger&#8217;s history is made much more interesting and appealing..</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Lastly, Mo, Capricorn and Elinor (Meggie&#8217;s great aunt) have their characters executed perfectly in the movie. Notwithstanding the small changes to their living conditions, histories, and so on, the characters are well represented. The film and the book are at a draw here.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">I would\u00a0recommend\u00a0anyone to watch the film before reading the book because its much better that way. A rare view for me, who champions for books in the <del>books vs films war</del>, but here the case is an exception.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em><strong>If I could read anyone out of a book, (give me a genie in a bottle\u00a0any day), I would definitely read out Harry Potter*, Heathcliff and Catherine**, and Paddington Bear***.

It was a full blown thunderstorm, with dense grey clouds that seemed to have absorbed all the world&#8217;s grief. For me, however, the blue grey streaks that split the sky into fragments were well wishers, old friends. I felt ecstatic, comfortable, safe.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">And then lightning struck.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">How ironic that something I loved with so much devotion just destroyed me in half a second of blinding brilliance? I felt a current ripping through me, smelled my flesh charring, melting off my bones and being reminded of a roasting fowl in a fire pit. Ridiculous thoughts streamed through my mind: lightning wasn&#8217;t just white, it was all the colours of the rainbow and then some; would the blisters that were opening in folds along my skin ever fade?; would I ever be able to wash out the stench of human skin, muscle and sinew clumping, singeing, dripping?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img class=\" wp-image aligncenter\" id=\"i-3257\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/lightning-is-striking-agian-bright-colors-19822963-877-618.jpg?w=292&#038;h=206\" width=\"292\" height=\"206\" />I died.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Two days later, the mourners arrived. Clad in deathly black, from their clothes to their expressions to their moods, they came. Swiftly, some walking in groups, huddling against each other for support, some alone, braving it out. My father was there, his face a wretched mask of pure agony, his expression paying tribute to the sanity that had been lost two days ago. My sisters, their blank faces staring at the casket wherein I lay, trying to reach me. And my best friend, trying to stay strong, supportive, but being given away by her trembling lower lip. My cousin, making his best effort not to do anything rash. And my mother, arranging the event, being the supportive, solid barrier, needed sorely.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">In actuality, this was a dream I had.

I wish for a time machine so I could go back and be raised to be a part of them.\u00a0<em>The Secret Life of Bees\u00a0</em>and\u00a0<em>The Help\u00a0</em>are two books that have reinforced this wish.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-3268\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/woafg00z.jpg?w=180&#038;h=240\" width=\"180\" height=\"240\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>4.

Standing on a shadowy street corner with an uplifted head, searching for her next customer. Heavily rimmed eyes, the kohl giving her an aura of toughness she doesn&#8217;t really possess. Inches thick padded push up bra to uplift her cleavage, and her chances on the street. A wanton,\u00a0<em>blase\u00a0</em>attitude: she catcalls, whispers, entices.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">In short, she sells herself. All night, every night.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">She finds a man willing to pay, leads him to her rooms, the nearest motel, wherever. He doesn&#8217;t know her name, will never remember her face. If he&#8217;s shy, she&#8217;ll do all the work, if not, she&#8217;ll be worked on. In short, she&#8217;ll cater to his every need. At the end of her\u00a0<em>usual routine,\u00a0</em>he&#8217;ll refuse to pay, slap her around, humiliate her further. He&#8217;ll be drunk, he&#8217;ll call her a whore, he&#8217;ll spit in her face. For she has no rights, and no voice.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">People say prostitution is a God awful business. All those women,\u00a0<em>how could they?\u00a0</em>Do they have no shame, no dignity, no courage to fight for the right thing? What they don&#8217;t know is, courage fails you when you have 4 mouths to feed, clothe and protect. How can you do the right thing when the only skill you have is buried deep inside of you, and you&#8217;re forced to open it for business?\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">I read about that 15 year old Afghani girl, who was married at 12, then forced into prostitution by her inlaws. When she refused, she was beaten, burnt and had her fingernails pulled out. You tell me now. Where could she have found the\u00a0<em>moral fiber,\u00a0</em>the damn\u00a0<strong>courage,</strong>\u00a0<em></em>to fight back?\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">People are so narrow minded; they believe whatever they see. They&#8217;ll see a woman selling herself on a street corner and think &#8220;This is disgusting, this is the lowest point of humanity, this is filth.&#8221; What they won&#8217;t bother to see is the pain and the desperation under there. She might have been forced into it out of sheer poverty, out of torture, or both. What do you know?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Every year, over a 100,000 children are forced into sex labour, prostitution and drug peddling. Once older, they&#8217;ll have known no other way of life. To judge them, based on the fact that you saw them selling their services in the street, is sheer ignorance.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Prostitution might not be the dream job: God knows the risks associated with it. AIDS, legality, physical pain, terror. And people still think girls do it for fun. Perverted are the people who call on call girls.

Taking up another\u2019s original idea, concept and theme and adding your own version it.

Can they ever know the despair, misery and anguish that resides in the hearts of the people watching them?

That&#8217;s the amazing thing about it. I also noticed that when I was angry or agitated, the stitches started to become bolder, more open looking, as opposed to when I was calm, and they were neat. The phrase &#8216;putting your whole heart into it&#8217; didn&#8217;t seem ridiculous to me after this; when I bake or crochet, or knit, whatever I feel goes into the process and the finished product reflects my mood. Maybe I&#8217;m just sentimental?

You do this quite frequently and every call leads more and more to the point where you just go over to their house and play with their pets.</p>\n<p><strong>5. The House Key</strong> &#8211; So that one time when your friend decided to give you a copy of their house key when they went on vacation and needed you to water their ficus&#8230;you&#8217;ve kept it.

Sibling Connection</strong> &#8211; Of course you know your best friend&#8217;s siblings. Of course you talk to them. Of course you text them and ask them where your best friend is when the latter doesn&#8217;t answer your text messages.

While yes, it is true that if you were walking in a neighbourhood and came across a black chains swinging teenager, you&#8217;d nervously shuffle aside and keep 911 dialed on your cell phone, I feel this debate is a teensy bit hypocritical. Obviously black music, hip hop and rap have some messages that promote violence, drinking and promiscuity, but then I ask you: what of the multi million dollar industry that is high fashion?</p>\n<p>Okay so it might not be on the same scale as this apparent problem. But while we can blame African American rappers for promoting a sloppy look and drug use, all the while making millions off their music, why don&#8217;t we consider blaming the fashion industry for their inaccurate portrayal of the human body? I find it disturbing how every year, diseases like anorexia and bulimia are climbing, because girls and boys start to find imperfection with themselves. Size 00 has become the new 0, 0 has become the new 2 and so on&#8230; Black rappers might be sending unhealthy messages to their community, but what of the sick images that fashion distributes?</p>\n<p>At the same time, obesity is rising in the USA, so we know the food industry is doing well thank you. Fat teenagers turn to starving themselves, hating their bodies, caught in a vicious cycle. This mostly affects Caucasian women and men, if the research is to be believed. And while potential models don&#8217;t turn to street crime or\u00a0 violence, they do revel in drugs, promiscuity and drinking. My point in this debate was not to negate Bill O&#8217; Reilly or whine about white people hating on black people. I simply wanted to present the other side of the argument, and show you that every race has it&#8217;s own problems and issues, and harmony is key.</p>\n<p>As O&#8217; Reilly put it &#8220;Who wants to see someone&#8217;s butt crack?&#8221;.

He says that by being a blonde, she can trick people into believing she&#8217;s intellectually inferior, and then trump them, So yes, while I don&#8217;t believe in women dumbing themselves down for men, the occasional foray into the fa\u00e7ade of lesser knowledge benefits girls.

Free drinks of course! No girl can deny that at least once, she&#8217;s used her genial smile or empathetic pout to get something she wants. It&#8217;s the nature of the male species, to respond to a flirty eyelash bat, or warm compliment. While if a man came up to a woman and did the same thing, I can assure you all he&#8217;d get would be the woman&#8217;s drink&#8230;splashed across his face.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img class=\" wp-image aligncenter\" id=\"i-3499\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/phigamblingfreedrinkscasinos.jpg?w=263&#038;h=198\" width=\"263\" height=\"198\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>#3:\u00a0PAEDOPHILE\u00a0ALERT&#8230;</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">You&#8217;re walking down the street and you see a child fall off his bicycle. If you&#8217;re a woman, you&#8217;ll immediately run to rescue the kid, kiss the grazed knee, and offer to take him or her home. If you&#8217;re a man however, and you attempt any or all of the above, you\u00a0<em>will\u00a0</em>be taken into custody and called a paedophile. Women aren&#8217;t generally seen as cougars or sex offenders in everyday society, whereas men have fragile reputations. The blame falls on the poor guy, even if was just trying to help a kid back on his bike.

The &#8216;Damsel in Distress&#8217; card that we carry around all the time. Whether a girl chooses to play this card or not is up to her, but let it be said that if a girl professes to be in trouble, the nearest male\u00a0<em>will\u00a0</em>come running. Men have to use their so called superior strength to get themselves out of trouble, but we don&#8217;t need to do anything &#8216;cept beckon, and be saved. Yes, if you&#8217;re a\u00a0<strong>&#8220;strong, independent women who don&#8217;t need no man&#8221;,\u00a0</strong>then power to you. But you still have this card with you.

But one has to admit, poor men suffer a lot more pressure than we do. A guy with any self respect knows he has to provide for his future family, and to do that he needs solid career plans, and no mistakes. We as women have two choices. We can go on to study, or give it all up and just get married, and personally know many girls who&#8217;ve chosen the latter. Whatever a girl chooses is her discretion, but the fact that the choice exists is one of the greatest advantages of being a woman.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image aligncenter\" id=\"i-3506\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/images-11.jpg?w=215&#038;h=214\" width=\"215\" height=\"214\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">So, women, wake up and just feel happy to be you.

To respect her privacy, I&#8217;ll call her Fee here.

So I asked her to tell me the full story, which I&#8217;m not going to write here, translated, in her words:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>&#8220;My sister was born a pretty little thing, with big big eyes, heavy lashes and silky black hair. My father held his hopes for her; he wanted her to marry into a rich family so she could alleviate our desperate circumstances. I suppose you&#8217;d find it strange that the moment she was born, we talked of her future marriage, but this is how it is, no two words about it. As soon as she became 13 years old, my father found her a husband. She was innocent and quite naive, and she thought marriage meant living in the same house with someone else, cooking for him, and not much besides. A week later, my mother and I dressed her up in the best clothes she owned, not telling her what was going on. We thought she should know on her own, in time. So there we led a 13 year old girl, my little sister, outside and introduced her to the 60 year old man who would soon be her husband. She looked up from under her lashes, shyly at first, but then when she saw his face, thought we were joking, and loudly said &#8220;Okay, you&#8217;ve had your fun, now where&#8217;s my husband?&#8221; Clearly an uncomfortable situation for my father, who at once dealt her a stinging slap across the face; she stood silent.</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>Three months later, she was married. We polished and waxed every inch of her skin, still without telling her anything that was going to happen, and made her recite vows sitting beside a man old enough to be her grandfather.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>You, baji might find this all shocking, but this is how I was married too. You&#8217;d think our fathers would&#8217;ve stopped looking at us as dowry debts, but never. My sister has been verbally, physically and sexually abused by the man she was entrusted to, and I&#8217;m sure she still doesn&#8217;t understand. He never lets her out of the house, doesn&#8217;t let her speak, and will beat her more if she doesn&#8217;t produce a son in the future. Most of us, we stop fighting, because we know ultimately, this is what happens.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>And in the end, women must accept.

I could be anything: a princess, a surgeon, Tinkerbell, you name it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Those were simpler times. I always wanted to meet all my family.

No politics or hatred existed for me.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">I played with my mom&#8217;s hand bags, pretending to be an adult, stumbling in her high heels, laughing when I fell. How was I to know adulthood brings its own pain? I used to sit in the garden for hours with my plastic saucepans, &#8220;cooking&#8221; food made up of wild berries, leaves and twigs which I would then serve to my hungry imagination. I used to wait for rain so I could look for snails. Spring meant collecting ladybirds. The orange ones could fly while the red stayed, frozen to the back of my hand. Grasshoppers and crickets alike would find their way to my room, where I welcomed them, fearless.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">The heroes and villains of my imagination lurked in every corner, and I used to wait impatiently for bedtime so I could dream. God knows how many childish dreams my pillow harboured uncomplainingly. Part of me still wishes I could remain a princess forever, in my stronghold, forever turning in circles.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">And I have discovered that there is a <strong>recklessness about childhood that if I think about it, equates to driving your car full speed down a busy highway when the brakes are shot</strong>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3535\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/a-childhood-idyll-1900.jpg?w=300&#038;h=235\" width=\"300\" height=\"235\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n", "post_id": 3518, "location": false, "date": "08-12-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["life", "humor", "personal", "travel", "postaday", "california", "memory", "love", "childhood"], "text": "<p style=\"text-align:center;\">I woke up today with sunshine in my hair.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">No, seriously.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">My dorm room is currently suffering a power outage.

A general hush fell over the city. People were packed in their homes, eating, resting, dreaming. Walking a little way into the woods you&#8217;d find a world apart. There were thousands of tiny conversations taking place infused with the tang of pine and honeycombs. There were the beetles that tapped, cicadas that hummed and a confused mosquito or two.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Sacramento was the perfect place to dream, to\u00a0<em>feel\u00a0</em>my dreams.

Go ahead, you&#8217;re too depressed to look away anyway.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><b>1. </b><strong>Other people.</strong> So, I mean why make the effort to talk to anyone really? People are strange beings, so different from each other and yet the same. They live in these illusions where they choose to ignore the inevitability of death, global warming and sticky orange fungus on the walls. No one is unique, you definitely aren&#8217;t. So why exist in a mindless vortex of random relationships? Better to cut off completely and get a pet rock.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\u00a02.\u00a0<b>Books.</b> What do books have? Yards of paper with sharp edges just begging to give you paper cuts? And meaningless words forming dyslexic patterns in your head. Your parents told you reading would make you smarter. What they didn&#8217;t tell you was that it will eventually kill you. You will absorb ideas of suicide and depression and end up staring in a mirror cursing the day you decided to wear bright pink lipstick. The books are to blame.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><b>3. Nature.</b> Fresh air and exercise? It&#8217;s all for the weak. Why go outside when you can sit comfortably inside and think about death? Must you have birds swooping on you and pecking out your eyes? Or insects hiding and laying eggs in your ears so you end up with a brain full of maggots? And the sun, it gives you skin cancer and blisters. Nature is definitely out to get you, and sunblock is not your friend.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><b>4. Education.\u00a0</b>So you have a teacher with a toupee and shifty glasses trying to tell you who Jane Austen was? Big deal, everybody knows. What they don&#8217;t teach you in school and college is how educating yourself will actually kill you. I mean, Suicide 101. Education will lead you to research, and while you&#8217;ll pretend to be searching for the connection between carpets and golf carts, you&#8217;ll actually be looking for the right mixture of pills and powders. Plus, education just gives you a bad attitude. Leave it alone.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><b>5. Food. </b>Anything and everything you eat ends up harming you one way or another, doesn&#8217;t it? You&#8217;ll want to eat broccoli thinking it&#8217;s healthy and whatnot, only to ignore the fact that it lays seeds in your stomach and before you know it, you have green blood oozing through your veins. You think sugar is bad for you? Well so is wheat. So is fiber. All the creepy complex connections between food and digestion and glucose will end up in your death, and it won&#8217;t be pretty. Why eat?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><b>6. Breathing. </b>Of course, isn&#8217;t death inevitable? So why breathe at all? You know you&#8217;re going to die at some point, why make the effort to live? Everything around you is hell bent on killing you anyway, might as well speed it along by not inhaling oxygen.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\u00a0<img class=\" wp-image aligncenter\" id=\"i-3623\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/funny_death_by_airesnf.jpg?w=294&#038;h=250\" width=\"294\" height=\"250\" /></p>\n", "post_id": 3619, "location": false, "date": "10-10-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["postaday", "humour", "college students", "university", "random", "teenagers", "college", "homework"], "text": "<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Hey, I&#8217;m trying to survive.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">I sleep four hours a day, and sometimes I skip out on it altogether.

But to whom, and how?</p>\n<p>To a <strong>&#8216;respectable&#8217; older woman</strong> who calls herself dignified, and carries herself with the assurance that she has never sinned. She sees the addict, looks down at him, wrinkles her petite nose and walks on. To her, he is the epitome of human drudgery.\u00a0But if one were to look into her past, and see how addicted SHE was once, with a man who was not her husband, and how she planned to leave her children, her family, and herself all for him, one might understand the nature of controversy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We all of us lead controversial lives. You shudder to yourself wondering how people would react if they knew what goes on in your head. Or the life you have lead.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I see a <strong>girl walking with her head held high</strong>; she has money spilling out of her wallet, a platinum card that gives her security, and a father who will always be there to provide more. You look at her, envious, wishing you had the good fortune because some people it seems have all the luck, while others, none. If only you knew then, how her father gets his money, how many people he has trodden on to get to where he is, the shady deals and meetings in dark alleyways. Oh, and did she mention? How much his mistress costs him? A new necklace today, diamonds tomorrow, and so on.</p>\n<p>If you could see all the hidden tiny things that thread through human lives, you would be shocked. But there is dark gravity in them: it seduces you, the very fact that it is hush hush. Look at your own life, at your own secrets. And if by some miracle, you think you have none, then and only then may you start to judge other people.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img class=\" wp-image aligncenter\" id=\"i-3657\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/judge.jpg?w=292&#038;h=280\" width=\"292\" height=\"280\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">We struggle to be perfect in an imperfect world.</p>\n", "post_id": 3653, "location": false, "date": "11-15-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["life", "humor", "people", "personal", "postaday", "college", "stories", "education", "sleep in college"], "text": "<p style=\"text-align:center;\">There I used to be, in a crisp, blindingly white uniform, sash all pressed, not a hair out of place, sitting with my legs tucked beneath me.

Going from a private English school to an American university&#8230;walking across worlds.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>1. Professors are human too.</strong> In an English private school, pupils are taught to address teachers reverentially as \u201cmadam\u201d or \u201cmiss.\u201d We are required to say good morning, please, would you madam; anything short of outright curtseying\u2026\u201drequired\u201d being the key word.

Your books aren\u2019t enough anymore.</strong> Get good grades in that test. Cram the night before and write everything you know. It\u2019s either a pass or fail. Come to school, study and go home. Not so here. Now there are clubs, and groups, and projects to \u2018get involved\u2019 in. You can teach a child, write a script, or glue yourself to a ps3 for hours on end. You find yourself staying back till 7-8 pm at least. Being used to set timings like a drill sergeant, this was also a weird progression.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img class=\" wp-image aligncenter\" id=\"i-3668\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/books.jpg?w=234&#038;h=206\" width=\"234\" height=\"206\" /></p>\n<p><strong>3. Nobody cares.</strong> Okay, don\u2019t get me wrong. I don\u2019t mean to say you\u2019ve been abandoned completely. But as in a convent where nuns feel it\u2019s their personal duty to scrutinize your nails, hair, shoelaces and personal conflicts, it is completely the opposite. Your life actually becomes your life. What you do in your personal time is your business, and yours only. Unless you know, you decide to become the friendly neighborhood serial killer, and then that\u2019s problematic.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img class=\" wp-image aligncenter\" id=\"i-3670\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/1board.jpg?w=324&#038;h=206\" width=\"324\" height=\"206\" /></p>\n<p><strong>4.

Sleep is a luxury you cannot afford.</strong> I remember sunny afternoons in school where we got lectured on the importance of naps and sleep.

The teenager stares incapacitated, struck with the horror of what is called a \u2018civil\u2019 war; he hears a movement, whirls around, and finds himself face to face with the mouth of a gun.

A jagged chunk of glass; what is unseen are the pools of blood wasted to get it. Blood Diamond. They climb out of holes in the earth, the mines like gaping mouths to swallow them whole.

We don\u2019t think about the horror that humankind has to face: it\u2019s convenient to stay in a cocoon, sheltered and ignorant. Because who wants to see the slack jawed corpses that line the streets of Sudan? Or the corruption that has seeped into the political system of Pakistan?

When you go away to college with stars in your eyes, parents and peers will most likely tell you it&#8217;s going to be challenging yet rewarding, hard yet gratifying, complicated yet worth it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Everyone talks about the academic point of it. But very few look at the other side.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">So college is tough on you. It is. What I&#8217;ve realized is that nobody is born stupid. Everyone I&#8217;ve met has the ability to absorb information, process it, and make something out of it. But what they don&#8217;t talk about in all the <strong>&#8220;CHOOSE US!&#8221;</strong> university brochures is the emotional stress of it all.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Yes. Emotions. You have them too.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">You&#8217;re in college, and emotions probably will mess with your papers and readings. You&#8217;ll feel isolated, hopeless, in despair. And if you&#8217;re in another country, you&#8217;ll miss the feeling of home. College will start to feel familiar and homey but a shamble second best version of it. Arguments with friends might play around with the test you have in the morning, or a late night might lead to a missed 8 AM class.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">And this is why being a college student is hard work. It&#8217;s time, time, time. You give time to your work, to your friends, to family, pets, exams, papers, food, laundry, social networks, and the lonely kid sitting alone at the back of class. Or your friends might yell, your family might disown you, your pet might die, people might forget who you are, and that lonely kid might swallow arsenic and it&#8217;ll all be your fault. And through all this you have to stay motivated, focused, and\u00a0<strong><em>love what you&#8217;re doing for God&#8217;s sake.</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em><img class=\" wp-image aligncenter\" id=\"i-3729\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/download.jpeg?w=143&#038;h=202\" width=\"143\" height=\"202\" /></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">It&#8217;s no wonder they don&#8217;t print this in the brochures.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\u00a0</p>\n", "post_id": 3712, "location": false, "date": "12-27-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["life", "love", "family", "personal", "postaday", "resolutions", "friends", "new years", "thoughts"], "text": "<p>2013 was the year of so much loss and so much more gain. I got rejected from one college, got into two others, and took a year off. In this \u2018gap year\u2019, I learned so much, met so many people, laughed, and cried. Since this is New Year\u2019s Eve, I thought it only fitting to write down all the things I\u2019ve learnt to (and not to) do. A new way of deciding resolutions per say\u2026</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>#1: ALWAYS SEE THE BEST IN PEOPLE</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em>\u201cNabay, I\u2019m sure they mean well, and their hearts are in the right place\u2026\u201d &#8211; Zara Nadeem</em></p>\n<p>Ahh, my unbiological sister of 13 years. I\u2019ve grown up with you, fought with you, laughed my head off, and cried in front of you with no inhibitions. We\u2019ve had the best and worst times together, and we\u2019ve always known we&#8217;ll be friends forever. I&#8217;m so sure we&#8217;ll call each other in the middle of the night when we&#8217;re working girls, complaining about bosses, colleagues, or salaries. And then later, husbands, children, who knows what will happen? The one thing you&#8217;ve taught me always with so much sunshine is to always always see the best in people. You yourself deal with people in the cleanest way possible: ignoring their flaws and determinedly supporting them no matter what. Thank you for the lesson, I&#8217;ve seen you live it for 13 years.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>#2: IGNORE FORMALITIES, STOP HIDING, AND CONNECT</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em>\u201cWhy do you want to call and see if she\u2019s okay? Just show up\u2026\u201d &#8211; Mehar Umer</em></p>\n<p>Mehar, we became friends rather unexpectedly in Business class. I honestly didn&#8217;t think we&#8217;d ever end up friends but when we did, it was wonderful. You were always full of energy, happy, and hilarious. Oh, and super well dressed of course. One thing I learnt from you was to dismiss the tiny formalities people make around each other. I don&#8217;t know if you remember, but a friend we hadn&#8217;t talked to in years was sick and instead of waiting to text her, you urged me to just show up and check on her. Yes, if you need to connect with someone, do it now. No formalities.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>#3: DON&#8217;T BE TOO HARD ON YOURSELF</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em>\u201cSometimes you don\u2019t get A\u2019s and that\u2019s okay. You have to be happy with the learning process.\u201d &#8211; Syed Owais Ali</em></p>\n<p>Ahh, Owais. One of the first people I met when I came to Northwestern. You did (and still do) your very best to help and guide all of us who arrived with stars in our eyes. The best thing you&#8217;ve ever told me is exactly this. I was crying my heart out because I got rejected from something or the other and was emotionally killing myself over it. You patiently explained that quitting was not an option because sometimes, you can&#8217;t get A&#8217;s, but it&#8217;s not the end of the world. It took you some time to come to terms with that too, and I&#8217;m glad you chose to share it with me.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>#4: SPEND TIME LAUGHING, NOT HATING</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em>\u201cYou waste your energy on disliking people. Stop.\u201d &#8211; Areeb</em></p>\n<p>I&#8217;m referring to you as just Areeb because you&#8217;re the last person I could ever be formal with. When we met, I remember thinking you were loud, hyper, and insane. So just like me. You&#8217;re one of the most brutally honest people I&#8217;ve met here which has turned out to be a blessing in so many ways. Yes we&#8217;ve had our clashes but then we&#8217;ve also had the best times in the world. We&#8217;ll always be playlist soul mates and whiny best friends. Recently we went out, and you told me I spend way too much time picking out the bad things in people. And that maybe I should stop using my energy to dislike, and instead do something better, like have fun. You don&#8217;t know how right you were. I&#8217;ve started practicing that, and it&#8217;s been amazing.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>#5: UNDERSTAND, DON&#8217;T JUDGE</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em>\u201cEveryone is an amalgam of past events and current issues, therefore I try not to judge them.\u201d &#8211; Rhytha Zahid Hejaze</em></p>\n<p>Rhytha&#8230;when I first met you I was quite taken aback. The first thought that came to my mind was &#8220;loud, brash, how do I get along with her?&#8221; It was quite a confusing time, trying to understand what sort of person you are. A couple of days ago though, you talked to me about judging people and how you always consider their past events and current issues, and then try to understand who they are. So I realized what i&#8217;d been doing was judging you all along. And a lot of other people. I never used to be like this you know. Something happened earlier this year which sort of made me bitter; it has stopped now. A lot of thanks to you for that. I feel like I&#8217;m becoming my old self bit by bit and it&#8217;s an incredible feeling. </p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>#6: STAY OPTIMISTIC</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em>\u201cI take all the negative thoughts I have and turn them into positive energy. This helps me stay optimistic.\u201d &#8211; Urooj</em></p>\n<p>Urooj! The face you always make pops into my head everytime I think of you. Remember all the crises I had when we met initially? I worried about this or that, got pessimistic about a lot of things. And then we took a walk where you told me what you do to deal with problems and everyday stress. You thought about things in a positive way instead of letting negatives cloud your emotions or judgement. This is really the best thing about you, and something I&#8217;ve learnt to try and practice.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>#7: AS LONG AS YOU LIKE YOU, YOU&#8217;RE OKAY</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em>\u201cNot everyone can like you, but as long as you like you, that\u2019s okay.\u201d &#8211; Rizan Baig</em></p>\n<p>Who hasn&#8217;t had to listen to censure or criticism? People can be cruel sometimes, and they can break down the strongest soul out there with words and insults. We bonded on the 24th of August because we found out how alike we were. Worriers to a fault, perfectionists, and mushy. I was feeling particularly low one day and Rizan, you basically dragged me back out of the mire. You told me that I can&#8217;t make everyone like me, and it&#8217;s more important that I like the sort of person I am. I&#8217;ve seen you do this every day. If you find out someone doesn&#8217;t particularly love you, you don&#8217;t bat an eyelash. You continue being your own person and doing what you have to do. It took me a while to learn and come to terms with this one though. I&#8217;ve finally got it now. Thank you for that.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Happy New Year, all of you.

Because he never had the opportunity to work or study. He feels powerless, hopeless.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">And then what about the people who view the world in different ways? Who never could see colour, or light, or shiny new toys. The ones who can&#8217;t hear, and will never know what too much noise sounds like; they&#8217;ll never have a favourite band or play the guitar.

Anyone, and I mean anyone can fake a smile. I\u2019ve met people who led their friends into believing they would die for them, with a single smile. Ridiculous.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">So anyway. Picture yourself walking in with a bright smile (real or fake), meeting everyone around you, talking to people you\u2019ve never met before, drinking it all in, <i>living life </i>or whatever it is you\u2019re supposed to be doing.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Crack a joke or two. Be witty, clever, and charming.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em>Then sit back and watch.</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">People will start to gather like flies, in droves. Someone will tweak your hair, hug you from the side, shake your hand, or say something funny. Pretty soon, you\u2019ll have a group of laughing, hilarious people saying things they don\u2019t mean, and smiling like their lives depend on it.

Imagine yourself entering a room with a nervous, or sullen expression. You feel insecure, vulnerable, and there\u2019s no sunshine in your hair. You can\u2019t smile, you can\u2019t talk, and you can\u2019t really \u201csocialize.\u201d Something\u2019s happened: you argued with your parents, failed a class, a relative passed away, anything. You sit back and look around. A friend or two passes by, and you greet them, wondering if they\u2019ll know. They don\u2019t. People look at you with glazed smiles, their gazes sliding over you, uninterested.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">How many friends do you have now?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Think about it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">If there\u2019s someone who has been patient throughout, someone who\u2019s seen your worst and best, and still sticks to you like peanut butter to jelly, you take it. A sister, brother, parent, friend, partner, pet, or tree. Doesn&#8217;t matter. You love them to bits, and understand how unique this is. I realised this recently: five minutes ago. It\u2019s rare that you find people who care, and <strong>care</strong> is a strong concept.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">The inability to care about people shows a lack of basic humanity \u2013 who are you if you can\u2019t help out someone who needs it?

I was ten years old, and in heaven.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">She had one of those old fashioned wrought iron gates &#8211; it swung open to a red brick path. I&#8217;d walk to the left, jumping three steps down to the garden. There was an old fashioned orange orchard tucked away in the corner. This was the place I sat in for hours on end, dreaming my child&#8217;s dreams. Tree bark felt jagged and smelt musky sour. To this day when I think of that orchard, I smell dusty orange blooms and wild grass.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">To the right was a tiny pond. Lotus grew in a flaming pink riot all across the surface. I recall trying to muster up the courage to reach for a mass of glistening leaves and faltering. I knew if I caused ripples, I&#8217;d find myself staring into a pair of black eyes &#8211; one of the many black horned toads that lived just under would pop up. Standing on the bank was a challenge. Moss green algae caused many near-falls and squeaky yelps.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">I was afraid of drowning.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">There was a secret path that I believed only I knew of. Grape vines grew rampant on the abandoned white trellis that lay in that grassy patch. I used to pretend it was my home: I lived in a mad fairy world; it was intoxicating and made me heady. Dark green vines intertwined to make fancy carpets for my bedroom floor, leaves coiled and made intricate tapestries, thicket bursting with fruit made windows, and trailing creepers like serpents threaded their way from under my front door.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">I&#8217;ve never had that feeling of fullness, of\u00a0<em>being there</em> wholly.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Until today.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Today, was a good day.</p>\n", "post_id": 3774, "location": false, "date": "02-01-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["relationships", "funny", "life", "humor", "personal", "postaday", "teenagers", "love", "girl"], "text": "<p style=\"text-align:center;\">There&#8217;s a kind of love that I&#8217;ve heard about.

They need drama, and passion, and if they don&#8217;t find these things, they&#8217;ll create them. I&#8217;ve met girls with &#8220;trust issues,&#8221; with &#8220;dad issues,&#8221;, &#8220;mom issues,&#8221; and &#8220;pet issues&#8230;&#8221; you name it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">What is this: being passionate means wonderfully violent? What?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">The kind of love I believe in means laughing everything off &#8211; laughing at each other, learning to laugh at yourself. Being comfortable with making mistakes in front of each other. Everybody needs a best friend. This need to be perfect in his or her eyes&#8230;no.

Will it help you <strong>wash the car, water the plants, feed the cat, hug your mother, eat that suspicious looking piece of cheese hiding underneath your bed, look out a window, or have a conversation?</strong> No. I repeat myself: <i>no. </i></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </i>Well yes, there is always a deeper meaning. Mathematics makes up the world, and all that drama. It might explain a lot of mysteries, but it does not help me write this paper. Yes yes, math was used in the programs my laptop uses or the rate at which I type, or the frequency at which I spit out curse words when I think about equations, but that is a very indirect connection. This is why we have certain sectors of the economy dedicated to people who are good at numbers and that sort of thing. That doesn\u2019t mean arithmetic should be forced down my throat.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Let\u2019s look at an example of an equation and try to understand just why you think it\u2019s an important element in everyday life.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\" align=\"center\"><strong>\u201cx + 2 = 28\u201d</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\u00a0This clearly means you need to find \u201cx.\u201d I have an issue with this. WHY in all holy hell does anyone need to find \u201cx?\u201d Why is it lost in the first place? If it didn\u2019t have the good sense to stay where its mother told it to, why should I bother to pick up a pencil and look for it? It\u2019s like the problem of the child lost in the parking lot. If it had listened to its mother and stuck to her close, it wouldn\u2019t be left behind when she went home from the supermarket. It would have been in the car with her and all his snotty siblings, going back to their shambles of a hut they call a house.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Coming back to the point, I reiterate. If \u201cx\u201d was this irresponsible, I don\u2019t need to look for it. I want to practice my arithmetic and algebra, not act as unpaid babysitter.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Now, to find \u201cx\u201d one would have to follow a set of rules. One would move the \u201c2\u201d to the other side, inevitably making it a negative number, then subtracting it from \u201c28\u201d to arrive at the answer for \u201cx.\u201d Asides from my obvious question of <i>why in hell, </i>I have another concern. Who says, and I mean WHO is dictating these rules? If I want to move the number across the side without changing its sign, I should ruddy well be able to. These rules for equations, BODMAS etc., try to dictate our lives. This should not be the case. Freewill is a concept that has been thrown around since well, since the human race started. Furthermore, it is also one of the rights of a citizen in the USA. The <b>First Amendment </b>clearly states that all persons of a free and just country may have the right to free speech, free will, and free expression. What is math, to denounce the great country of America? The rules go against every rule free man has ever known.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Were cavemen told how to hunt? No sir. Were soccer moms told how to suffocate their children with over displays of emotion and exaggeration? No indeed! These skills are learnt over time as any great concept is, as life is. Laying out rules as to why and how something should be done doesn\u2019t resonate with my personal beliefs and as a student of an American institution, I believe I should be given the right to practice my faith in good conscience.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Going back to the equation, the answer is clearly 26; \u201cx\u201d has been found. \u201cx\u201d was hiding in the equation all along. So my question is, why is this little sadistic bastard allowed to play these mind games? It poses a befuddling threat to unsuspecting human minds; why in the world do we allow it to take advantage of us like this? I for one, possessing much bravado and courage, do not allow anyone to take advantage of me in this way. I feel this is a good approach to life: if you let things affect you, you will fall. You <i>will </i>die on broken knees.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\" align=\"center\"><strong>x<sup>2</sup>\u00a0+\u00a0x\u00a0\u2013 4 = 0</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\u00a0Let\u2019s look at this one. Here, instead of having to look for one \u201cx\u201d, there have been given two. TWO inane lost children without the common sense to stop drooling on their thumbs and grab their mother\u2019s coat tails instead. And now they have been left behind. And they are crying. And you need to look for them. Well, I don\u2019t envy you your job at all.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So this is an example of a quadratic equation. Hateful, filthy things. These are the bad dreams that keep you awake at night. This particular one doesn\u2019t even factor and so is a more spiteful SOB. What you must do to locate the ever lost \u201cx\u201d, is to apply the quadratic formula. Now again, why you would do that will forever remain a mystery to me.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Solving this and finding \u201cx\u201d is one thing. But when you want to create a graph out of this\u2026well we have a problem. I have given you a full background on the worthlessness of equations in general. Now I will tell you why it is also fruitless to turn them into lines.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What is a graph? Basically bunches of criss cross lines drawn across a page of pretty squared paper. Why would you want to complicate that by putting equations into it? Its one thing if you needed a graph <i>urgently </i>because let\u2019s say, your grandmother was having a seizure and you needed to know the exact amount of time an average phone user takes to place a panicked phone call based on general data collected in a survey by hospitals. Will you at any point ever need that information? I don\u2019t think so.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Equations in graphs aren\u2019t required for any useful purpose other than to make my life hell. You say you need them for vital things such as forecasting the weather, or checking the federal deficit, or predicting a slump in the business cycle, but do you really? Humans have been living on this earth since time started, and they managed not to wipe out the race. Everyone knows nuclear weapons will be the death of us, not badly forecasted weather. So why even bother?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I haven\u2019t talked about the sheer stupidity mathematicians do when they bring in more than one variable into an equation: let\u2019s say \u201cx\u201d and \u201cy.\u201d So if the child was inept enough to get lost with a friend who has no way of contacting its mother, well then. What is the world coming to?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I see no reason for drawing up equations, or integrals, or square roots, or graphs, or strawberry milk. All these things I can live without, and thrive, even.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There should have been a graph to show how disgusted I am by the concept of math and equations. The more math I see, the worse my day. At least we have a direct, honest, relationship.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img class=\" wp-image aligncenter\" id=\"i-3855\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/maths-board.jpg?w=292&#038;h=182\" width=\"292\" height=\"182\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em><strong>*This post was written purely for comic relief.

They face an interesting transition. These are a few of the things they go through:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>#1 The &#8220;EVERYONE IS MY FRIEND&#8221; phase</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">You meet a new person nearly everyday as you find your way around campus and the dorms. This gives you the illusion that you&#8217;re socially accepted, and/or even popular. You feel like being generous: saying hi to everyone you see, smiling, and waving to people at the bus stop or down the hallway. All your issues seem to be everyone&#8217;s issues: you&#8217;re all away from home, and trying to adapt like so many insects feeling their way. And so you bond. And bond. And bond some more.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>#2 Then it &#8220;CLIQUES&#8221; in</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">No, that girl you met last week in the cafeteria doesn&#8217;t actually listen to alternative rock. And that guy who called you cute and asked you to hang out sometime; he sidles past when you wave now. Now you see the groups they have. You pacify yourself&#8230; &#8216;<strong><em>college can&#8217;t be like high school!</em></strong>&#8216; And then you realize otherwise. People who knew each other before you knew them stick together. Others have formed new cliques. It all happened so fast, you didn&#8217;t even have time to sit and ponder with a thoughtful expression. Cliques can form on the basis of race, gender, nationality, campus, age, music tastes, soda preference, wealth, and so much more.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>#3 Ride on the &#8220;DOWNWARD SPIRAL&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">So you find out you have no &#8216;real&#8217; friends, and you&#8217;ve ignored the ones you had back home and so they probably hate you. Your cat probably wants nothing to do with you either. What could be worse? You shut yourself up in your room and decide that studying is the solution to everything. Except you also know that&#8217;s impractical, but\u00a0<em>you have no real friends, so what do you do?</em> You&#8217;re trapped in a whiny social conundrum. Welcome.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>#4 Answer your &#8220;PHONE&#8221; already</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Your parents gave you space and time, and more space and more time. Now they want to know what you&#8217;re up to. You probably haven&#8217;t remembered to call them up in the last few days because of all the issues you were having. But they don&#8217;t know that. They&#8217;re sitting 3000 miles away fuming and feeling ignored. And so the family problems begin. You feel like slamming your phone and severing contact altogether. Yet you know you can&#8217;t, so just sit there and take it. Grit your teeth.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>#5 You do have &#8220;BOOKS&#8221; you know&#8230;</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">You came to college to study. And while orientation is glossy and happy and sunny, you will need to get to studying eventually. Added to the other problems, this realization will hit you the hardest. Didn&#8217;t you have your fair share of dreams? Visions of a 4.0 have clouded you over. You think you&#8217;ll fail, or die, or get expelled. No, you won&#8217;t. Trust me.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>#6 How does your &#8220;WALLET&#8221; feel?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">When you moved in, your parents bought you everything: pins to paper to shower curtains. And now you must fend for yourself, mustn&#8217;t you? Back at home you&#8217;d say &#8220;I&#8217;m rich today,&#8221; or &#8220;I&#8217;m poor today,&#8221; depending on how much money your parents forked out every morning for school. And now&#8230;your three jobs have you running around in circles trying to balance it all out.

It wasn&#8217;t like this though. He was the warrior, the king. He&#8217;d know everything about everyone; he&#8217;d come home with Enid Blyton books for me [she was my favourite author] and Justin Bieber cutouts for my sister&#8230;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Today, we ended up at a shawarma place &#8211; and I felt like the adult. I told him where the place was, how to order, what to ask for, even the right way to unwrap the food. This is not something I&#8217;m used to. I&#8217;m the one who would be led around and ordered for.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">It&#8217;s the small things, but that&#8217;s where our mortality lies.

He looked as if he had a deliciously dramatic life where no one understood him and where his sullen, brooding voice kept getting lost in the crowd.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">He played the drums and listened to violent music. And he had lots of goals he wanted to achieve in some glorious far off future.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">I was drawn like moth to the proverbial flame.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">He wanted to be a rockstar, singer, songwriter, drummer. I wanted to know where he got the confidence from. I mistook ego for maturity.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">He was my Three Days Grace phase; I took long nighttime walks in the garden with my music blaring to &#8216;sort out&#8217; all our problems. And my life was full of drama and complexities and hurt and laughter and pain.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Hey, whoever says teenage love isn&#8217;t real love, needs a reality check. Teenage love brings its own suffering &#8211; you have to be in it to understand. And once having been there, you should not let yourself forget.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Then my exotic and mysterious relationship took a dramatic plunge. And I don&#8217;t mean a jump. I mean a losing-control-of-the-car-and-it-skids-and-crashes-off-a-mountain-and-rolls-to-the-jagged-rocks-below. That is what happened.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">His complicated ways and deep emotions became too much to handle and at one point there was too much grief for there to be any love left.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">And then one day I woke up to find that the love was gone. The feeling that made me attach myself to him had quietly packed its bags and tiptoed out at some point during the night. I felt free.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">I broke his heart once. And never looked back.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Okay maybe that&#8217;s not entirely true. I looked back, but my feet stayed planted forward.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">And maybe at some point in the future, I&#8217;ll write about the love I found later. The kind of love that doesn&#8217;t need flash powder and smoke screens. The kind of boy&#8230;man, that is sunny days and endless skies and green grass. The kind of love where pain is only a whisper, and even then, is silenced in a millisecond. The kind of man that doesn&#8217;t need to be mysterious in order to be interesting. He is my best friend, and he is me, and I him.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">No, that is too close to the heart.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Hey teenage me, you pulled through.</p>\n", "post_id": 4137, "location": false, "date": "09-12-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["relationships", "life", "love", "family", "personal", "memories", "postaday", "romance", "humor"], "text": "<p>In the last year, I&#8217;ve learnt:</p>\n<p>That childhood is simply gone. All that remains are jasmine scented memories, soft and blurred around the edges like the yellowed pages of a well read book. I will never be as innocent, as naive, as foolish, as vulnerable, and as big hearted. Sometimes I&#8217;ll be walking home, and I&#8217;ll catch a whiff of something that&#8217;ll remind me of the century old trees I grew up with. I&#8217;ll remember the nights when the living room windows were frosted over and my old electric heater did its best to warm my toes. <strong>These memories will slam into you and often they will make your heart skip a beat, but that&#8217;s all they are.</strong> Recollections. Images. Sounds.</p>\n<p>That there is not one great love in anyone&#8217;s life. There are many times you can fall in love, ride the crests and beat the storms, but it continues. The\u00a0kind of love is different, every time. There may be a boy who inspires you to be better, and once that happens, you may leave. There may be a girl who you adore from the delicate nape of her neck to her pink painted toes. And those may be the only things you love about her. <strong>Love is love. Move with it, and never settle. If it&#8217;s meant to be, it will.</strong> Like all things in life.</p>\n<p>That maroon lipstick can at once be prim and exciting. Firetruck red will attract and repulse simultaneously. A deep crimson can be promising, but more sensual than you prefer. Whatever your shade of lipstick, know that it does not define you. A woman may be called by so many names: sister, mother, wife, girlfriend, daughter, virgin, whore, tomboy, lesbian, drama queen, princess. <strong>A person can be many different things at once. But you must always be able to recognize yourself.</strong></p>\n<p>That people are people are people. I am at times an introvert, and other times cannot sit still without spouting three conversations\u00a0all at once. You will want to attach yourself to someone. Don&#8217;t. It is safe to depend, I understand. We&#8217;re built that way. For the first 18 years of our lives, we depend and receive and rely. But it is time to stop. Be self reliant, but don&#8217;t harden. <strong>Give of yourself freely, but take only that which will make you stronger.</strong></p>\n<p>That we are complex and infinitely changing. I was wondering why people cheat. The story of the wife who one day feels a pain in her stomach as though she has been gutted. She knows. Then the evidence: lipstick on the collar, the inevitable guilt, paranoia and mistrust. Or the other way around. You might cheat one day, and so might I. But we are complex and this cannot define us. At any given time, someone feels a range of emotion that no therapist, tv show or medication can fully recognize or label. <strong>Give some leeway, to others and to yourself.</strong></p>\n<p>That my books have carried me through the most trying times even now, when I don&#8217;t manage to find the time for them. Growing up, you gather resources: money, effort, experience. But you lose time. And that I think, is the very tragedy of human life. If only I had more time. I would spend days locked up in my pillow fortress and read till my mind protested. I would spend time with you Harry, running up and down Hogwarts. And I would shake you Anne, for not choosing John over Robert, just because he was a man in uniform. And I would lie down in the kitchen in Wuthering Heights and have a conversation with Heathcliff when he was young and not as savage. <strong>Find the time for these people.</strong> They have seen you through all the ugliness that mortals would never have.</p>\n<p>That I live in a false world, but there is truth in the mud and dirt and grass. Nature does not lie. <strong>It is the one thing that stays constant when human hearts fail.</strong> And I&#8217;ve learnt to take great comfort in knowing that if all else fails, there are mountains standing tall somewhere. And the sky has become my ceiling. A deep purple silken ceiling that expands and breathes and makes me feel safe. Nature is the truth.

What I don&#8217;t understand is why it has to be about religion. I&#8217;ll tell you some ofwhat Christmas means to me:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong>The Tree&#8230;\u00a0</strong></span></em>Who doesn&#8217;t like Christmas trees? I grew up decorating weathered evergreens with red and green globes, hanging tiny presents strung with rainbow ribbons, stringing fairy lights on the branches, and spraying a blanket of dazzling white, albeit fake, snow all around. I should explain: I went to a Convent for the first 13 years of my academic life, and picked up certain traditions that have stayed with me throughout.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong><em>The Gifts&#8230;</em></strong></span> If you&#8217;ve never had presents on Christmas, you&#8217;re missing out. I&#8217;ve never shied away from any excuse to get presents from friends and family. What&#8217;s more, at school we used to exchange gifts with class mates during Christmas week. I&#8217;ve never been more excited than when I went to do my all important &#8216;Christmas shopping'; I would buy scented pink and green erasers and think myself the Queen of Christmas Cheer.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><em><strong>The Carols&#8230;</strong> </em></span>Sometimes, when I&#8217;m sitting studying, I&#8217;ll play carols to myself. Silent Night, Joy to the World, and Jingle Bells have threaded their way through the background of all my childhood years. And at Christmas time, they&#8217;re all the more promising. The music and lyrics make me feel at peace on long winter nights.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><em><strong>The Books&#8230;</strong></em></span> If you&#8217;re a reader, you have to love Christmas. I have a ritual. Every December, I snuggle up in my fleecy purple blanket and spend nights reading. I read Dickens&#8217; Tale of Two Cities, A Christmas Carol, \u00a0and Bronte&#8217;s Wuthering Heights. These three always get me in a rustic winter holiday cheer mood.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong>and&#8230;The People:</strong></span></em> You don&#8217;t have to be Muslim or Christian or Jewish or Hindu or more to appreciate a holiday where people in the world come together and tell tales about Santa Claus to shiny eyed children. Or where families gather around a tree with hot cocoa and excitement for presents. Most importantly, you don&#8217;t need religion to look at the goodness around you: when people who celebrate Christmas are eager to give back, do charity, feed other people, and work for the less privileged.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">This might be a romantic portrayal of the holiday, but if we can&#8217;t get together and look at the romance in our lives once in a while, how will the human race continue to hold their heads high above everyday misery and sorrow?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Get into the Christmas mood and gather up some holiday cheer!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/christmas-carol-1938-cratchits.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4168\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/christmas-carol-1938-cratchits.jpg?w=300&#038;h=237\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"237\" /></a>My countdown to Christmas has begun.</p>\n", "post_id": 4167, "location": false, "date": "12-01-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["pink", "life", "seether", "love", "personal", "ipod", "playlist", "lists", "amy lee", "music", "pop", "taylor swift", "happiness"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/cat-listens-to-ipod.jpg\"><img id=\"i-46\" class=\"size-full wp-image\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/cat-listens-to-ipod.jpg?w=487\" /></a>\u00a0</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m totally a person who gets low and/or depressed once in a while ( I mean who doesn&#8217;t, right?).

I mean, don&#8217;t get me wrong, when cats decide to take in people, they usually love them, and don&#8217;t show it. I love them, and do show it, all the time. But they&#8217;re pretty unusual.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">There is first, an eighteen year old who isn&#8217;t the tallest specimen I&#8217;ve seen. When I want to climb up from her legs to her shoulders, I don&#8217;t have a lot of distance to cover. I sleep on her pillow, next to her hair, which constantly gets in my eyes. And so I try to untangle it with my nails. This one time, she nearly stepped on me and then, gave me a look of the utmost reproach, while I glared at her to show her who&#8217;s boss. She&#8217;s one of my prime\u00a0worshipers\u00a0(ehh, what can you do with fame?) and is always ready to pass out a hug, cuddle or behind-the-ear scratch. After I lost all three of my own kittens, which I&#8217;m not ready to talk about just yet, I was depressed for days. She \u00a0let me use her bed, where I slept all day, too heartbroken to move or eat, and I admit, she tried to take care of me as best she could. But if I start talking about what humans don&#8217;t understand, I would be talking for days..</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Sometimes, she sits on a desk in front of \u00a0a black machine which has a screen. I usually try to climb on it and sleep, because it feels warm and comforting. She pushes me off over and over. But i&#8217;m plotting my revenge. You&#8217;ll see.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">The second one in the litter, (for there are three in total), is a fourteen year old. And this one is quite tall, and quite thin. She&#8217;s a quite kitten, I mean human, but the one I like teasing the most. There&#8217;s something about her that makes her my perfect prey catching practice target. She likes spending most of her time with black wires in her ears, listening to people screaming in pain. Or\u00a0that&#8217;s\u00a0what it sounds like to me anyway. This middle one is quite noble, and bears the frequent scratches I give her like a warrior. I&#8217;ve even heard from the cat down the street that this middle one takes in <em>strays</em>&#8230;err cats which haven&#8217;t decided on a family to take in yet, and provides food and cuddles. I feel, as a human she is therefore adequately fulfilling her purpose in life, and is on the right track, although I will not let another cat take over my family. I don&#8217;t mingle with the street cats often, its too much cheap talk and rough fur.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">The last of them, is a small thing, just nine years old. She and I have our own war: we have a staring contest everyday to determine who is superior. Needless to say I know my duty, I always\u00a0<em>let\u00a0</em>her win. But I don&#8217;t usually go to her for affection, because she hasn&#8217;t yet learned to be gentle with animals, and for me, who is of a much higher distinction that humans even, she needs to learn much. There is always an\u00a0indeterminate\u00a0one in the litter, and I mark my claim on her anyway by rubbing against her legs so she does not run off with the street cats. A cat&#8217;s gotta do what a cat&#8217;s gotta do after all.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">These are the three most important worshipers I had to tell you of, as the rest don&#8217;t matter much. I hold my head up high and do not get offended at their less-than-welcoming natures. Well, nature fixes even the most stubborn human in time. So goodbye. And before I go, i&#8217;ll add a self\u00a0portrait, in which I look rather wise, philosopher like. You may wonder where I got hold of this, but like I said,\u00a0paparazzi\u00a0are\u00a0unshakable.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_492\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/image4852.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-492\" title=\"Image485\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/image4852.jpg?w=300&#038;h=168\" height=\"168\" width=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Reflecting On Life..</p></div>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n", "post_id": 491, "location": false, "date": "11-25-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["personal", "writing", "postaday", "winter", "lahore"], "text": "<p style=\"text-align:center;\">If you ask me, there&#8217;s something about winter nights in Lahore.

For some, it means flu and tissues, red noses and freezing fingers.

The sky even, never turns pitch black, rather stays purply blue like spilled wine, and is just as intoxicating. Going out is a heady experience, and makes you feel like you can do anything,\u00a0<em>be\u00a0</em>anything.

It erupts like an earthquake and then subsides. And when it subsides you have to make a decision. You have to work out whether your roots have become so entwined together that it is inconceivable that you should ever part. Because this is what love is. Love is not breathlessness, it is not excitement, it is not the promulgation of promises of eternal passion. That is just being \u201cin love\u201d which any of us can convince ourselves we are. Love itself is what is left over when being in love has burned away, and this is both an art and a fortunate accident. Your mother and I had it, we had roots that grew towards each other underground, and when all the pretty blossom had fallen from our branches we found that we were one tree and not two.\u201d<br />\n-St. Augustine</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Question answered.

Then she thought she&#8217;d stop being so easy.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">One day, she thought of how she wanted babies in the future. Little babies that would smell like milk and\u00a0cinnamon\u00a0and stars.

Motherhood is so much sacrifice. And she whines about it 24/7. Seriously, I have never heard a more vocal cat. She whines if the milk I put out isn&#8217;t the exact temperature she likes and so on..</span><span style=\"text-align:center;\"><br />\n</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">She got pregnant around two months ago, and started getting alarmingly fatter each day. Today of all days, when my mom was super annoyed of everything, Coco started whining outside my room window. We thought she was hungry or thirsty, so I put out some chicken and milk and water but she didn&#8217;t touch anything which surprised me a lot. She was making weird noises, whiny, but not like her usual whining. More like in pain noises. This worried me so I brought her inside and she immediately climbed into my closet and curled up. I thought she only had to pee, so I kicked her out and put her in her basket. This didn&#8217;t please her and instead she tried to open the closet door with her paws.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">I&#8217;ve never had a pregnant cat before so I had no idea\u00a0she was going to go into labour already! I cleaned out the bottom part of my bookshelf and lined it with old blankets and sweaters to make it cosy. Eventually Coco went and snuggled up inside. I was happy that she was comfortable and went to sleep. This happened around 3 in the afternoon. I woke up at 6 to the sound of what I thought was a baby bird cheeping. Turned out Coco had already given birth to an adorable little golden and white fuzz ball that was stumbling around in the sweaters blindly.. THIS WAS IT!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">I called my grandmother to the room and alerted my mom and told them Coco was now a mommy. YAY <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-bigsmile' title=':D'>:D</span>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">In half an hour she had given birth to two more kittens, and had fallen asleep on one of them. She was lazy and happy and very unaccustomed to the cheeping sounds they were making. Eventually she started cleaning them and then started nursing.

Unless you\u2019re the Terminator and walk around with blazing guns, you won\u2019t be strong enough and will likely become a weeping mess fast enough. So, <i>don\u2019t do it. </i>Instead, delete songs from your playlist. The ones that remind you of him/her/it. That song your cat accidentally always played when she climbed on your laptop. Remove it. Rihanna will always come up with new songs, but you can\u2019t make new memories.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">4. Now Dr. Phil might approve of this, sort of (not really). No one said you need to be strong, so why don\u2019t you go pick your favourite window streaked grey with rain, with tissues, and blubber for an hour or two? Why <i>not? </i>BUT, catch being, during that break down, find something that makes you happy. Anything, a little thing. So here, crying doesn\u2019t mean weeping like a lovelorn ostrich and then drunk dialing your German shepherd/ex/best friend\u2019s mom, telling them you\u2019re happier without them. <b><i>Step four: Cry your little heart out, and then find happiness, instantly. </i></b>I don\u2019t want you feeling sorry for yourself.

It starts with Anna Fitzgerald waiting to see a lawyer who has just recently, sued God, and won. Picoult brings a larger than life view to Campbell Alexander, the lawyer, and then places him as the would-be saviour of the Fitzgerald family. The two main issues in the book are the severe illness that Kate (the eldest child) has had nearly all her life, and the fact that Anna, her younger sister was conceived using in vitro fertilization with specific characteristics, a &#8216;designer\u00a0baby&#8217;, to donate various bits and pieces of her body to her sister Kate. \u00a0The book basically begins with Anna pursuing Alexander, and telling him she doesn&#8217;t want to &#8216;do it anymore&#8217;, ie repeatedly have to give of herself, literally.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">On ahead, there are two or three subplots that are interesting enough. Alexander&#8217;s love story with Julia, who has been appointed by the court to look into the Fitzgerald family, Sarah and Brian Fitzgerald (the parents)&#8217;s unraveling marriage, and Jesse&#8217;s (Kate&#8217;s brother)&#8217;s exacerbating arsonism. So all in all you could conclude that the novel is about an ordinary family, struggling to survive against an extraordinarily deadly illness, with bits of life, love and laughter thrown in.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Now on to the movie.</p>\n<p>The movie doesn&#8217;t look too closely at the subplots given, but that&#8217;s not to be expected. One and a half hour is not enough time to dive into the underlying plots beneath the original plot. The very fact that the actors picked to play Picoult&#8217;s characters emulate to a large degree, the actual ones is miraculous. Normally, you don&#8217;t see films in which the characters follow the book too closely. But in this one, Sara is just as protective, strong and fierce about Kate as she is in the book. In the film, she isn&#8217;t loving towards Anna after she finds out about the lawsuit her youngest child is handing over to her, while in the book she does to some extent, understand. But very little.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">The characters are well defined and &#8216;real&#8217;, what an irony, but the plot is changed to fit the film somewhat.. only if &#8216;somewhat&#8217; meant COMPLETELY AND IN A SHOCKING WAY.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Just at the end, when you might think the film won&#8217;t disappoint you after all, it does. The ending is altered completely 360 degrees. In the book, Campbell and Anna are driving when a car crash renders the latter brain dead. In doing so, her kidney is harvested and donated to Kate, who is at the mercy of renal failure. This crash completes the bitter irony prevalent in the book: Anna was fighting to not have to donate her kidney, and Fate decides otherwise. She wins the lawsuit for medical emancipation, and yet by default, becomes her sister&#8217;s keeper anyway..</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Now in the twisted awful film, things take their natural order. It is Kate who dies of her cancer and Anna who survives. A normal everyday ending, which contains none of the irony or the role of\u00a0Fate\u00a0so well defined in the novel. Just a natural simple ordinary ending. Sick girl dies, healthy girl lives. I mean really? The film loses, by a high margin.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Book or Film? Definitely the book.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Amen.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n", "post_id": 65, "location": false, "date": "11-08-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["emotion", "life", "humor", "family", "personal", "postaday", "sister", "daily prompts", "siblings", "sisters", "love", "writing", "happiness"], "text": "<p><strong>You have three hundred words to justify the existence of your favorite person, place, or thing.

I would have skipped the sisterly arguments, I&#8217;d get all the clothes, all the food, all the attention, etc. BUT.. the way things in my house are, if my sister wasn&#8217;t here to help me through everyday things, its likely I might have said adios to life long before I turned 18.

It was just too good to be true, as I found out today. I checked on the kittens, only to find that two of them looked&#8230;well, dead. I panicked and picked them up. They were barely holding on at the moment, and it appeared that Coco had just rejected them. She wasn&#8217;t nursing them or keeping them warm anymore. This is the first time I&#8217;ve had a cat who&#8217;s given birth and I had no idea what to do.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">I tried everything:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">I tried putting the kittens closer to Coco so they could feed, but she would just move away. The healthy kitten was feeding on its own and it was the only one she was paying attention to at all. This was very alarming. The two sick kittens felt cold to me despite the blankets they had been sleeping on, so I warmed up a heating pad and placed them all wrapped up on it. Soon one of them started to breathe more normally and even stretched and yawned. The other one just kept opening and closing its mouth very feebly and gave up.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">I took all the kittens and Coco to the vet who examined the sickest one and said there was no hope for it. It would die sometime during the next hour&#8230;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Right, imagine what you&#8217;d feel when someone tells you a little helpless kitten who&#8217;s still breathing is going to die in your arms, literally. It was so tiny, vulnerable and adorable, but what the vet said did come true. It died. My sister Minz and I didn&#8217;t want to give up hope just yet so we brought it home and laid it out on the heating pad, but it was really and truly dead. Minz wouldn&#8217;t believe it and insisted it was still alive. However, she had to go and bury it in a shallow grave near the flower bed in our garden. When she came back, she said she felt like she had buried it alive&#8230;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em>I wish we hadn&#8217;t buried it just yet. What if it was alive? What if?</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">The vet had told me to feed the surviving kitten every two hours with a dropper and baby formula. Its still alive, and Coco keeps rejecting it. Still, I&#8217;m hoping a miracle happens and it\u00a0survives.

But seriously, the one behind the shed is starting to smell a bit O.o</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">And seriously, what IS it with people wishing their sisters were never born? Yes, when we argue I do wish I didn&#8217;t have to see your face for the next hour, or two, max. But I&#8217;ve never ever EVER wished you hadn&#8217;t been born. Because if that had happened, or not happened as the case may be, I would have been an incomplete being.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong><em>\u201cIf you have a sister and she dies, do you stop saying you have one?

There&#8217;s nothing else to be. Once you&#8217;re a sister, you can&#8217;t revert to being an only child. That&#8217;s like a piece of you gone right there.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">So, Minz, I love you. And we&#8217;re sisters.

There may be too many apps running, or the processor is slow, or something happened to it, but I \u00a0assure you, this is a normal situation.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Reeeeeeeeallly?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">On average, smartphones &#8216;freeze&#8217; or &#8216;hang&#8217; quite routinely, as in its not an abnormal\u00a0occurrence\u00a0anymore. The solution? Download an app to manage apps more smoothly, to locate and dislocate various files around, insert a memory card to take the excess load off your phone&#8217;s internal memory. Is it me or did technology get fussy as it got faster?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">So I&#8217;ll take you back in time to meet an old friend of mine, called the &#8216;simple&#8217; phone. Sure, this friend of mine was produced in 2010, but it stands to represent consumer demand after all. That friend is the Nokia 1280..</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/nokia-1280.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-78\" title=\"nokia-1280\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/nokia-1280.jpg?w=224&#038;h=300\" height=\"300\" width=\"224\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Now when you look at it, you might think, hold on a minute, stop that car, get off that horse..this phone doesn&#8217;t have a camera, an mp3 player, and no memory card, OH GOD WHAT WILL I DO WITH MY 7 MILLION PICTURES AND VIDEOS?! Now before you rush off into cardiac arrest, let me tell you, I don&#8217;t\u00a0recommend\u00a0this phone for usage. Its merely an example of how simpler times might have been less tense too, in a paradoxical sort of way. Yes, there is no 1024\u00d7768 inch large mega cinema sized screen to watch movies on or play games on, and no bluetooth, even. I remember a time when the intro of infrared abled file transfer was a big thing (oh yeah, in my days&#8230;pfft).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">However, as a secondary or possibly third phone (for all you busy people who talk in everyday conversations like they&#8217;re still talking on the phone and never hung up), it could be a winner. Why? YOU know why. Okay seriously, here&#8217;s why:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">1. CHEAP.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">2. Really really really long battery life. I mean really.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">3. Texting is so much fun on the soft keys.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">4. *drumroll please*&#8230;FLASHLIGHT! Perfect for reading in the dark, underwater travel and general espionage of the everyday variety!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">5. Never freezes. Won&#8217;t hang while you&#8217;re getting a call, leaving you to fumble with a million keys while your &#8220;My Milkshake&#8221; ringtone plays loudly and proudly in class..</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">6. No one cares about the processor, because no apps. Don&#8217;t look down on that. Buy a fourth tablet or something.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">7. Call quality is super cool.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">8. Adults can work it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">9. Indestructible. A friend had one of these and dropped it off her balcony once. Nothing happened. Now if that isn&#8217;t a miracle, I don&#8217;t know what is.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Now don&#8217;t get me wrong. I love smartphones as much as the next tech geek. I had an\u00a0iPhone, two\u00a0BlackBerrys, three Nokias and more besides. But now I need a secondary phone purely for calling and texting, and guess what i&#8217;m going to choose?\u00a0I&#8217;m not saying we should revert back to caveman times, but this phone is pretty handy for your average phone user who wants to take some calls, text some people, and listen to the radio once in a while.</p>\n", "post_id": 77, "location": false, "date": "11-10-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["pakistan", "social issues", "postaday", "cruelty", "writing", "grief", "top stories", "trauma", "trafficking", "human trafficking", "humanity"], "text": "<p style=\"text-align:center;\">I now know one thing for sure.

There was a man in there, and two very thin, shy looking girls who looked like they had arrived fresh from a very very small town no one knew about. The man with them had on Ozzy Osbourne -esque brown glasses, his shirt was open to his chest, revealing a gold chain and a forest of greasy chest hair, and he smoke two cigarettes at a time. My mom and I kept our distance, sensing trouble at once.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Anyway during the elevator ride, the man kept telling the two girls random facts about himself, which painted him out to be a magnificent kind person&#8230;all tall tales, it was evident. And then as we stepped outside, we knew. There was something very shady going on. The two girls kept\u00a0<em>their\u00a0</em>distance from him, even though they were walking together and looked altogether completely scared and hiccupy.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">And so my mom told me that she was almost a 100 percent positive that this\u00a0obsequious\u00a0man was engaged in human trafficking. He had\u00a0probably\u00a0gone to a godforsaken village and brought the girls here, away from their families under false pretences. That would also explain why he kept tipping every random member of the hotel staff he saw. Sweeten the deal? This is apparently very rampant in Pakistan, but especially in Karachi, where no one questions anything.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em>Human trafficking.

The lawyer assured me there was nothing to be scared of. As the case proceeded, my mother and I were called in front of the judge. And then, it happened. The reader called my name and told me to step up onto the witness box. I swear \u00a0I thought I would faint.

Anyone else see the incongruity in this concept? Would you like to meet your boyfriend/hired actor pretending to love you dressed in sweats? Or worse, would you want to see THEM wearing old clothes that reek? Wouldn&#8217;t it offend you that they didn&#8217;t think you worth the effort to dress up and\u00a0look\u00a0good? Maybe splash on some deodorant? Surely, you can do that too, no? Guys are called superficial and shallow, but come on. If you want him to love the &#8216;real you&#8217;, don&#8217;t deck yourself out in old pj&#8217;s and expect a &#8216;Hey, you&#8217;re gorgeous..&#8217; anytime.

You&#8217;d be hard pressed to find a girl who doesn&#8217;t want that particular favour. However, opening car doors every time? This is the 21st century, unless I&#8217;m mistaken. You won&#8217;t land in horse muck\u00a0descending\u00a0alone from your carriage if the guy\u00a0doesn&#8217;t\u00a0help you&#8230;you open your car door for yourself all the time, don&#8217;t you? Don&#8217;t get your feathers in a ruffle because someone isn&#8217;t providing you with express doorman/valet service. And if he likes opening the car door, well then you&#8217;ve hit the jackpot&#8230;unless he likes smashing it back so it crushes you (my little joke).

For anything.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Now, girls get mad and blame it on PMS, but if their significant/or non, as you like, lashes out for no reason, suddenly its verbal abuse.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Hold on. Do you see how ridiculous this is? No its not PMS that<b>\u00a0makes you act snarky</b><em>.\u00a0</em>Its you. And if you can take out your bad temper on him, he can too, sometimes. Can&#8217;t HE be angry about something and be in a bad mood? Of course he can, because he&#8217;s human.

I mean, you <i>could, </i>if you really really wanted to, but why would you? You\u2019d have a fine pair of silky whiskers that you could manipulate, pull and arrange all the time as you like. And your skin would be slippery, fishy and will not need any maintenance whatsoever. Sure, your body will be more like a blob of squishy-ness, but your heart would be the same, and other walruses will love you, no matter what you look like.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">For the discerning walrus, there would be stores to purchase top hats from, and eyeglasses appropriate for the opera, for example \u201cWalrus and More.\u201d Add a waistcoat and you\u2019re all set. If you\u2019re a socially awkward walrus, you\u2019d need a cell phone to hide behind so you don\u2019t have to interact with other walruses face to face; this could also be arranged. Obesity would not exist, because aren\u2019t walruses <i>supposed </i>to be all blubber?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">As a walrus, you could have access to many amusement parks and zoos. Of course if you\u2019re a particularly handsome specimen, someone could always kidnap and ship you off to Peru, but the likelihood of that happening will be slim, since you\u2019d be so fat and hard to lift. So you see, the essence of this was to tell you, fellow human, that if you woke up one day as a walrus, life wouldn\u2019t be bad. In fact, it could be pretty great.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><a href=\"http://dailypost.wordpress.com/2012/12/06/daily-prompt-18/\">http://dailypost.wordpress.com/2012/12/06/daily-prompt-18/</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/toonvectors-24835-140.jpg\"><img id=\"i-832\" class=\"size-full wp-image\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/toonvectors-24835-140.jpg?w=130\" /></a></p>\n<p><!--[if gte mso 9]&gt;--></p>\n", "post_id": 829, "location": false, "date": "12-06-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["life", "random", "personal", "postaday", "writing", "fear"], "text": "<p>I gave my A levels in May this year, and already that feels like it was decades ago.

Well, &#8216;love the one you&#8217;re with&#8217; \u00a0crops up: a phrase which directly interprets as &#8216;love the person you&#8217;re with, even if you&#8217;re not in love with them, and don&#8217;t think about the one that got away&#8217;..\u00a0<em>In love\u00a0</em>and\u00a0<em>the one that got away?\u00a0</em>Is there nothing more to life anymore? Relationships are overrated. Unrequited love even more so. To me, loving the &#8216;one&#8217;\u00a0encapsulates\u00a0the place i&#8217;m in, the person (or people, yeah if I was that social) I&#8217;m with, and the sheer moment of time i&#8217;m in. And since I have a totally different view of the topic, I decided to write a &#8220;How To&#8230;&#8221; about it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">1. First off, start noticing things. Noting minute details, everything about the things around you. You cannot love or appreciate anything unless you understand it. So go ahead, notice the view outside your window, or if you live in a box on the street (respect to you), notice the cracks in the sidewalk. Yeah, that seems insane but trust me on this one. <strong>Little</strong><strong>\u00a0things matter</strong>. Start looking.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">2. If you followed point 1, its time to move on to the second step..(if you&#8217;re still stuck on noticing details, maybe you need glasses. Seriously, pick anything. Even a light switch will do.) The essential thing here is, you need to find happiness. No, good things don&#8217;t really come to those who wait. You need to go out there, or in there (depending on what your happy place is), and root the little sucker out. Found some happiness? You should at least have dug up a tiny smile, if only at how ridiculous this article sounds, but its there, right? You&#8217;re happy! Find some overlooked good thing in the detail you picked, something you never noticed earlier. <strong>The world can still surprise you <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)</span>.</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">3. Things done. Next: family. Now, you and I both have read the &#8216;blood runs thicker than water&#8217; bit and been taught\u00a0how to prioritize family and friends etc. Needless to say, everyone wants to throw their family on a space shuttle to Mars every once in a while, but we don&#8217;t act on that impulse, which shows true love, no? I like to think so. Anyway, pick the person you have the worst relationship with, and take some time to think on why that is so. You&#8217;re not a saint, so don&#8217;t go baking muffins and making up on an impulse, because thats just sentimentalism.. but do try and dwell on fixing your connection. That will be time well spent. <strong>Every minute you spend thinking of ways to atone for a mistake or repair a relationship will be productive.</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">4. Yes, there&#8217;s still more. I&#8217;m sorry, but happiness isn&#8217;t an easy commodity to come by, as are arguments, bad weather, and an empty fridge. People and things, done. The most important bit is left: time.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">&#8220;<em><strong>\u201cTime you enjoy wasting is not wasted time.\u201d<br />\n\u2015\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5784244.Marthe_Troly_Curtin\">Marthe Troly-Curtin</a>,\u00a0<i><a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/19136690\">Phrynette Married</a></i></strong></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Now see? The keyword being &#8216;enjoy&#8217;. Please don&#8217;t assume I&#8217;m promoting &#8216;live like you&#8217;re dying&#8217; or for that matter, &#8216;YOLO&#8221;, because those concepts are nearly always destructive and dangerous. I have a friend who got a navel piercing and an infection to go along with it soon after. Why? Because YOLO! What? <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-uneasy' title=':/'>:/</span>. To enjoy time is to love it, and live it. Living every moment is impossible, unless you can control your every breath, but you can&#8217;t. If a Tibetan monk is reading this, I&#8217;m sorry Sir, YOU can balance your breaths because you are a divinely spiritual being, but this is meant for ordinary people like me, who have no such luck. <strong>Every minute passed turns into the past, so try actually feeling and breathing the next minutes you have</strong>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Why spend time being negative when you can pick details, find small joys and do good things for the people around you? Relationships come and go but family (husbands, wives, dogs and cats included) and (some) friends really are forever. Like diamonds. And cockroaches.

Tell him you won&#8217;t be able to clean the top of the roof without him, reach your kitchen shelves, or get any work done without his famously dry humour making you smirk.

The eldest of the four siblings, a delicate girl who looked around 10 years old was sitting quietly on one of the swings, watching the 4 and 5 year olds playing and screaming. Her chin had an outbreak of acne and a few cuts that seemed infected, but she didn&#8217;t seem aware of them. Any time one of the younger children stumbled or fell, she got up, gently helped them get back on the swing and went back to her own, her calm vigil resuming.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">I saw her and I then I\u00a0<em>really saw her.\u00a0</em>She seemed to look far more mature than her years and it was clear she had taken on the role of caretaker and guardian rather than playmate, as she should have been.

And poverty breeds misery, so naturally they don&#8217;t have time or resources to care about their offspring, resulting in an abnormal family structure, with the eldest sibling acting as the surrogate parent.\u00a0</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/img-20121208-01304-copy.jpg\"><img id=\"i-933\" class=\" wp-image alignleft\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/img-20121208-01304-copy.jpg?w=238&#038;h=314\" height=\"314\" width=\"238\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Worse, if the children born are female, to the poorer classes, they&#8217;re only dowry liabilities and of no other use whatsoever. Boys get\u00a0preferential\u00a0treatment, while girls get slapped and kicked. Of the four siblings, three were girls, and the youngest was a little boy around 3 years old. He was the only one the eldest sister wasn&#8217;t watching. Coincidence? I don&#8217;t know, but things need to change.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Or we&#8217;ll have more children who have to be parents before they&#8217;re even teenagers.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">But that girl inspired me, and humbled me to quite an extent. She had infinite patience taking care of her siblings when she could have been jumping around with abandon. She could have been a child, could have had a child&#8217;s heart, or a child&#8217;s dream. But instead she chose to leave all that, at 10 years old.

Then you&#8217;re in the right place.</em></strong></p>\n<p>Hi, this is my new ballpoint. I just bought it in the morning from the store/peddler/random guy on the street, because I need it at school/at work/to throw at someone. Something miraculous will happen to it in a few hours&#8217; time. A tried and tested phenomena in fact. This little innocent ink-filled pen will get lost. Invariably. Someone will borrow it, steal it or beg it off me, and i&#8217;ll give it purely because i&#8217;m such a nice person and plus, I have like a million lying around at home or at work, so no problem. And just like that, LBP will occur. The Lost Ballpoint Phenomena. And I will be helpless to stop it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">LBP is just what I wanted to avoid, and so I set up my own &#8220;Lost Ballpoint Shelter and Trust&#8221; a few days ago. Its very official and proper I assure you.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img-20121112-01095.jpg\"><img id=\"i-97\" class=\"size-full wp-image\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img-20121112-01095.jpg?w=487\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Okay so I only have four rescue cases at the moment, but I found them from various dangerous ink threatening spots. Under the carpet, squashed under a table leg and one about to be sucked by the vacuum cleaner..these pens were really living on the edge.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">And to confirm your view on my (in)sanity, I have texted friends and told them to donate any lost ballpoints they find to my shelter. That isn&#8217;t very likely to happen; once you magically find one of these fateful sticks from a random location, you&#8217;re bound to it, for life. Or the next half an hour anyway: &#8220;Oh this! I remember I bought this in 1950, when the Korean War started. Never thought I&#8217;d see this again..&#8221;. And there you go. You&#8217;re hooked. A single ink filled stick brings back memories, and if its empty, then anger.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">I&#8217;m going to work strenuously to collect more ballpoints that just &#8216;turn up&#8217; as an antithesis to LBP, and give them a place to stay, hopefully never to be lost, wandering alone in dark alleyways again&#8230;wait, that&#8217;s me, not pens. The point being, keep on &#8216;lending&#8217; ballpoints to random people, never to see them again, because LBP cannot be ended. During my two years of A Levels, this was a recurring problem. I went to class with 6 pens and came back with 2, and I swear I had no idea where they went. They just did. I&#8217;m not alone in this. Support the Lost Ballpoints&#8217; Shelter, for LBP is unstoppable.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img-20121002-00391.jpg\"><img id=\"i-98\" class=\"size-full wp-image\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://allthosesmallthings.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img-20121002-00391.jpg?w=487\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 99, "location": false, "date": "11-11-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["harlequin ichthyosis", "personal", "postaday", "life", "disease", "nusrit shaheen", "medicine", "writing"], "text": "<p align=\"center\">You don&#8217;t know just how lucky you are, until you see this.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">What might you classify as &#8216;unlucky&#8217;?

Eastern Market is the perfect place to do it, especially for the new Tuesday market. The Tuesday market is like the &#8220;best of&#8221; from the massive Saturday market, from my &#8220;mommy&#8221; perspective. I <em>looove</em> Saturdays at Eastern market for the sheer volume and amazing vibe, but I can barely weave my way through the crowd myself, let alone with a stroller! </p>\n<p>You <em>might</em> not grab a Bloody Mary at Viviano&#8217;s with little ones in tow, but you&#8217;ll have your choice of locally sourced grass fed beef burgers with homemade buns at Ned&#8217;s food truck (totally cool converted airstream) with their farm fresh <em>accouterment</em>. Of course what kid doesn&#8217;t love macaroni and cheese?!? The Mac Shack has the most decadent options I&#8217;ve ever seen on this comfort food classic, a must-try.    </p>\n<p>Tuesdays market has all of my favorites. Coffee from the caboose cart, fresh leafy greens from Vang&#8217;s, made-that-morning bread and bouquets of gorgeous flowers to brighten any day.<br />\nWe tasted artisanal cheese, strawberry rhubarb jam, kale chips, pickles and even had a go on the xylophone! <em>You can&#8217;t get THAT at the zoo! </em><br />\n<img src=\"https://adventuresofadetroitfamily.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/20130801-002812.jpg\" alt=\"20130801-002812.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a><br />\nIf the little ones may ask for a cool treat on a sunny day, don&#8217;t deny them (or you). It doesn&#8217;t have to be a market day for you to enjoy Michigan&#8217;s own Hudsonville ice cream from Mootown Ice Cream shoppe. Try a double decker sundae, smoothie or even quesadillas! </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://adventuresofadetroitfamily.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/20130801-014203.jpg\"><img src=\"https://adventuresofadetroitfamily.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/20130801-014203.jpg\" alt=\"20130801-014203.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a><br />Grandma holding B while he tried his hand as a street performer.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://adventuresofadetroitfamily.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/20130801-015300.jpg\"><img src=\"https://adventuresofadetroitfamily.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/20130801-015300.jpg\" alt=\"20130801-015300.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n<p>Bathroom details: Bringing a potty training toddler anywhere can be daunting. &#8220;Potty Breaks&#8221; are frequent and it&#8217;s important to know where the good potty spots are. I chose the bathroom in DeVries (formerly R. Hirt Jr.) which lies between Shed 2 and Viviano&#8217;s. Head to the back wall of their delicious shop for a one person private toilet which your stroller might actually fit into. Otherwise, it&#8217;s rural rest stop accommodations in the public stalls next to the Welcome Center in Shed 3. </p>\n<p>Bonus: Shed 3 was open but not full of vendors like on a Saturday. It was an enclosed wide open safe space to let the toddlers run. There were some street performers from a Krav Maga  studio which were pretty interesting. There was even a business making an attempt at a &#8220;kid zone&#8221; offering a bean bag toss and face painting. I&#8217;ll be honest, I really didn&#8217;t go over to investigate because if B saw something he could throw he would&#8217;ve hurt someone or something. Plus, face painting gives me the heebeejeebee&#8217;s. </p>\n<p>Parking: At 10am on a Tuesday it was easier to find parking than on 7am Saturday. We got lucky with a spot directly in front of Viviano&#8217;s.</p>\n<p>By an hour and a half we had filled our market baskets and sampled our way through the entire market.

I hadn&#8217;t been to an air show in years and was happily surprised at how much they had to offer. Three generations of our family enjoyed a perfect weather day celebrating America. </p>\n<p>Amazing planes from the last century parked on the Tarmac for all to see and TOUCH! V<em>ery cool for B!</em> Then later, these same planes were started up <em>(hello gas and fumes!)</em> and flown through the sky with finesse. </p>\n<p>My favorite was a re-enactment camp depicting accommodations, weaponry and tactical gear from each of the major American wars from the last century complete with veterans in their official uniforms to tell their war stories. Another surprise was a WWII battle re-enactment with cannon fire and an ambush by the Germans. It seemed to be a HUGE hit for the young boys ages 7-9 years old (even more so than the bouncy house area)! </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://adventuresofadetroitfamily.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/20130813-060206.jpg\"><img src=\"https://adventuresofadetroitfamily.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/20130813-060206.jpg\" alt=\"20130813-060206.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://adventuresofadetroitfamily.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/20130813-060342.jpg\"><img src=\"https://adventuresofadetroitfamily.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/20130813-060342.jpg\" alt=\"20130813-060342.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://adventuresofadetroitfamily.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/20130813-060422.jpg\"><img src=\"https://adventuresofadetroitfamily.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/20130813-060422.jpg\" alt=\"20130813-060422.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n<p>We brought a picnic of fruit, trail mix and PB&amp;J sandwiches, a blanket, some folding chairs and enjoyed five hours of non-stop fun.

Adults $35 but I bought a Living Social deal for half off plus a deal on parking (usually $15). All told I spent $77 for four adults and one child to park and enjoy. I felt like I got MORE than my money&#8217;s worth! </p>\n<p>For additional fees you could take a ride in an actual plane or dine in air conditioned comfort in a special luxe tented gallery. We did spend $10 for an all day pass, versus $3 per jump, for B to jump in the bouncy houses, which, in my opinion was 100% worth it. There were also rock climbing, bungee swings, tennis and other kid-centered activities. I feel confident that any child or adult could find something to spark their interest here. The day was perfect enough, where even an indifferent teen could simply relax and soak up the sun while the family browsed around. There was certainly enough security, military and fire safety personnel present to put a parents mind at ease. </p>\n<p>Food: Check their website for any changes but this year (2013) you could bring in anything that did not require a cooler. No alcohol or barbecues of course <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)</span></p>\n<p>No Smoking!

I love the rest stops on the Ohio Turnpike. </p>\n<p>2. I hate the tolls on the Pennsylvania Turnpike (holy $28!!).</p>\n<p>3. I hate driving in the rain. Especially when I have to keep adjusting the speed of my windshield wipers.</p>\n<p>4. I hate driving next to trucks when there is no shoulder, we are on a mountain, in a tunnel AND in a construction zone. I blame having watched too many action movies where things tip over and blow up!</p>\n<p>5. I get extremely aggravated, irritated and irrationally angered by people who leave their blinker on for MILES!! C&#8217;mon people, don&#8217;t you HEAR it, SEE it?!? I mean, HOW, HOW do you not know?</p>\n<p>6. I love that the Maryland Welcome Center rest stop has a Play scape!! INGENIOUS!! Note: the two people we saw both times through this past week keep this place as immaculate as Italian grandparents kept their tomato gardens&#8230; a true beacon on the long, long road.</p>\n<p>7. I love that B must have two quarters and a shiny penny to crank out those &#8220;penny pincher&#8221; commemorative pennies at each and every opportunity. Unfortunately, I&#8217;ve discovered half of the machines are not working (at least the ones we encountered between Michigan and Virginia).</p>\n<p>8. I love the ocean, <em>buuuut</em> the beach is sandy. Sandy in such a way that no matter WHAT you are wearing, eating, drinking or laying/sitting on, you will be getting sand in your mouth and every other unmentionable, uncomfortable crevice possible. I always forget this when I enthusiastically plan a day at the beach.</p>\n<p>9. Hotel pools feel SO chlorinated that I always want to do a Silkwood-style scrub down afterward. (It&#8217;s an 80&#8217;s movie, called Silkwood, <em>watch</em> it)</p>\n<p>10. I love my family. They came in from three states just to hang out for a weekend. I love my sisters gourmet, no-carb, perfectly portioned dinners (I think I lost weight, thanks sis!). I love my brothers constant joking about how he hates the water and hates heights, but he is special forces in the Navy and jumps out of airplanes INTO water for his <em>job</em>! I love the scruff of my dads beard on my cheek when he gives me a BIIIIG hug every time I see him.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://adventuresofadetroitfamily.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/20130901-221221.jpg\"><img src=\"https://adventuresofadetroitfamily.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/20130901-221221.jpg\" alt=\"20130901-221221.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://adventuresofadetroitfamily.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/20130901-224019.jpg\"><img src=\"https://adventuresofadetroitfamily.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/20130901-224019.jpg\" alt=\"20130901-224019.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://adventuresofadetroitfamily.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/20130901-224453.jpg\"><img src=\"https://adventuresofadetroitfamily.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/20130901-224453.jpg\" alt=\"20130901-224453.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://adventuresofadetroitfamily.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/20130901-224517.jpg\"><img src=\"https://adventuresofadetroitfamily.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/20130901-224517.jpg\" alt=\"20130901-224517.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://adventuresofadetroitfamily.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/20130901-224606.jpg\"><img src=\"https://adventuresofadetroitfamily.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/20130901-224606.jpg\" alt=\"20130901-224606.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n<p>My hubby had to work this Holiday weekend so I called my long distance family and arranged a last minute gathering of a few of us in Virginia Beach.

However, he did also use the public facilities here today, exercising his new found ability to pee standing up. The restrooms were clean and fully stocked. There was no kiddie potty like at schools or museums, but it was a public restroom that didn&#8217;t induce the gag reflex, always a good thing.</p>\n<p>We played for about an hour and then headed over to visit Eastern Markets Tuesday vendors in Shed 2.

The lights of the small business mall beckoned and we purchased some Detroit memorabilia. My sister a shirt, for mom a mug, a sweater and a set of coasters. The husbands marveled at the biker gear and beer accessories. I nibbled some Germack nut mix and coveted a Warhol- esque canvas that could be made from your own photo. <em>Something for everyone! </em>Then we all agreed the beer tent was a good idea. </p>\n<p>Live music is always enjoyable to me, but it&#8217;s especially fun when you can watch your three year old jam out like nobody&#8217;s watching.

Next time you consider buying tickets for a Tigers game, ask for the Pepsi Porch, you will not regret it.</p>\n<p>I am not a die hard fan of baseball. For me, to go to a game it has to be an experience. I want to sip something new, taste something new and not have to wait in line for a stinky bathroom. That is asking a lot for most stadiums, unless you pay for a suite. I heard from a friend the Pepsi Porch was a great place to go, especially with kids. I took a chance for a &#8220;special occasion&#8221; and went above our usual bleacher seat purchase. I sipped locally brewed beer, munched on strawberry-marshmallow kabobs and shared cotton candy with my two favorite people. The crowd-free restrooms were less than 50 feet away from the seats and were spic and span. There are comfy couches all around and a full service bar, plus the &#8220;wave&#8221; was a BIG DEAL in our section. </p>\n<p>Comerica Park is great when it comes to family entertainment and customer service. We rode the all Tiger carousel and the Baseball Ferris Wheel with ease (just $2 per rider). A quick visit to the Customer Service center (nicely air conditioned) for our birthday boy and we walked out with a certificate, rubber Detroit Tigers bracelet, baseball and mini bat. Too bad the birthday boy was turning 43 and the customer service representative gave it all to our 3 year old, but he should&#8217;ve known better, ha ha!

Although this guided hike was on a paved path and only took us about a half mile, it was FULL of fun and really interesting facts about the wildlife that literally is in our backyard. My 3 year old may have been more interested in the trail mix (because it had chocolate nibs in it this time) but he gabbed endlessly to all those who would listen about how you can EAT dandelions, how Wood ducks LIVE in trees and how bees burrow in the GROUND!!</p>\n<p>We are not planning our next family vacation around a hike on the Appalachian Trail but this was a great hiking introduction to our preschooler.

The parks open at dawn and close at dusk. Admission is per car and is $5.00 per day or you can buy a yearly pass for $25.00 and get into all of the metro parks year round. This is NOT the sticker you can buy for an extra $10 when you renew your license plate every year, those are for State Parks like Belle Isle. Bathroom facilities are clean and plentiful. There are traditional playscapes, paved hiking trails and boat launches. There is also the amazing feeling of &#8220;getting lost&#8221; within a completely safe and comfortable environment.

All passengers are taken on a first come first served basis do try to arrive thirty minutes before boarding and be prepared to stand in line, even if you&#8217;ve purchased your tickets in advance.</p>\n<p>Good to know:<br />\nThe ramp (the gang plank?!) was too skinny to fit the stroller through so we had to &#8220;unload it&#8221;, fold it and carry kiddo and everything else on board. Once on board we could&#8217;ve stayed in the dining area but attempted going up on the covered deck. Found a nice shady wooden bench (relief) after braving metal stairs that were more like a ladder (yikes). The bathroom was much like you would find on an airplane, so diaper changes would need to be done &#8221; al fresco&#8221;. You can bring drinks and snacks on board for the 0-5 year olds but anyone 6+ better have cash on hand for anything else available at the bar.</p>\n<p>At $17 per person 6+ years old for a two hour cruise it&#8217;s a fine family value, though I&#8217;m glad I had a half off deal. </p>\n<p>\n<strong>Does your toddler love the water?

I mean when does the instinct to put your hands out in front of you as you fall begin? I know toddlers are top heavy with their wobbly legs and balloon shaped noggins but, seriously!? Apparently he was playing with an excavator (no longer just a truck, these kids are specific and discerning) when he started to run to show it to someone and tripped. The excavator was completely unharmed in this incident. B on the other hand may be scarred for life. </p>\n<p>He cried one of those cries that starts out as long silent inhale, mouth agape, but ends up as a blood curdling horror film worthy screech. My heart dropped. I heard the thud of his over- sized head clunk the pavers like a ripe melon. After we calmed down and wiped him clean, all was well. One of the fathers there is a physician and examined B. No stitches or MRI&#8217;s needed, &#8220;just keep it clean and he&#8217;ll be fine&#8221;. In the end all he needed was a hug and a lollipop.

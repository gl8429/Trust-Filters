Like, real bad. I won&#8217;t lie &#8211; we\u00a0researched our brunch options purely based on how much bacon appeared on the menu. After some deliberation we settled on Breakfast Thieves.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amelbournite.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/14297847878_f385a3a77a_b.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-998\" src=\"https://amelbournite.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/14297847878_f385a3a77a_b.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" alt=\"BreakfastThieves\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\n<p>Tucked back from Smith street on the corner of Gore street, Breakfast Thieves used to lie on my running route when I lived in Collingwood. Despite passing the cafe countless times (at unimpressive speeds) I&#8217;d never stopped for food but it&#8217;d been on my brunch list ever since.</p>\n<p>Due to our bleary-eyed Urbanspoon bacon search we rocked up for a later brunch at 11.30am but impressively only had to wait 10 minutes to be seated. The tables were packed but the staff were quick to pick up on any empty seats.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amelbournite.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/14297992617_10ba89141c_b.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-997\" src=\"https://amelbournite.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/14297992617_10ba89141c_b.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300\" alt=\"BreakfastThieves\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<p>I ordered the Ms Florentine (poached eggs on wilted spinach with yuzu &#8211; hollandaise). Served with a side of bacon (of course).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amelbournite.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/14483176112_48433b4f6f_b.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-999\" src=\"https://amelbournite.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/14483176112_48433b4f6f_b.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300\" alt=\"BreakfastThieves\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<p>It was easily one of the best eggs florentine I&#8217;ve had\u00a0and improved by a very generous serve of bacon. \u00a0I&#8217;m not much of a hollandaise fan but the addition of yuzu gave the sauce a citrusy-sweet tang that matched perfectly with the eggs. My fellow bruncher and partner in bacon opted for the slightly more adventurous Spanish Gypsy Dance (polenta rolled poached eggs, relish and black pudding) with the obligatory bacon side.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amelbournite.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/14483200254_ef1bd3cc3b_b.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1000\" src=\"https://amelbournite.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/14483200254_ef1bd3cc3b_b.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" alt=\"BreakfastThieves\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\n<p>Although I was a vegetarian for 2 years until very recently I&#8217;ve always held a fondness for dishes like haggis and black pudding\u00a0and BT version didn&#8217;t disappoint. It was a little more tomato-y than others but good enough that I was happy to steal what I could off my companions plate. Overall our food was double-thumbs up from both of us.</p>\n<p>My coffee wasn&#8217;t the best I&#8217;ve had in Melbourne but no major complaints.</p>\n<p>We also picked up a white chocolate lamington and dark chocolate &amp; salted caramel lamington for later. There are no pictures as in my usual enjoyment of delicious foods I forgot to take a picture. They looked like lamingtons but were more cakey in texture and taste. But oh, so tasty. My waistline will suffer living only a short walk away.</p>\n<p>Delicious food and reasonably priced, BT are another solid contender for my favourite brunch spot in Melbourne.</p>\n<p><strong>So good it can&#8217;t be legal</strong><br />\nBreakfast Thieves<br />\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">S</span>hop 1, 420 Gore Street<br />\nFitzroy<br />\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.breakfastthieves.com.au/\">www.breakfastthieves.com.au</a></strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/71/1675465/restaurant/Melbourne/Breakfast-Thieves-Fitzroy\"><img style=\"border:none;width:130px;height:36px;\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.urbanspoon.com/b/link/1675465/minilink.gif\" alt=\"Breakfast Thieves on Urbanspoon\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 1001, "location": false, "date": "06-23-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Siem Reap", "travel", "Asia", "waterfall", "Cambodia", "Angkor Wat", "temple", "SouthEastAsia"], "text": "<p>I spent most of my Cambodia holiday in Siem Reap volunteering at <a href=\"http://www.feedingdreamscambodia.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Feeding Dreams Cambodia</a>, a community school that provides free English lessons, community support and school meals to over 700 children from Siem Reap&#8217;s slums.

Not only is it significantly cooler at dawn but the sun rising over the temple is breath-taking. We spent most of a day exploring\u00a0Angkor Wat and its surrounding temples but you can spend as long or as little as you like. There are hundreds of temples in the national park but most visitors\u00a0do\u00a0a small or big loop of the main temples (we did the big loop in an exhausting day).</p>\n<p>Another worthwhile day trip out of town is to Phnom Kulen, a sacred mountain to the Khmer people. We climbed up to see a\u00a016th century statue of Buddha and then spent most of the afternoon cooling off in a waterfall. A word of warning &#8211; the little fish that nibble dead skin off your feet call the waterfall home.

It&#8217;s a bit of a mix of everything.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amelbournite.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/photo-1-39.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1271\" src=\"https://amelbournite.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/photo-1-39.jpg?w=276&#038;h=300\" alt=\"SheBeenBar_Melbourne\" width=\"276\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<p>Inside it&#8217;s a little bit kitsch, a little bit retro and very laid back &#8211; lino covers the tables, murals along the walls and some fake greenery snakes along the roof.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amelbournite.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/photo-3-37.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1266\" src=\"https://amelbournite.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/photo-3-37.jpg?w=300&#038;h=184\" alt=\"SheBeenBar_Melbourne\" width=\"300\" height=\"184\" /></a></p>\n<p>What makes Shebeen a little more special is all of its profits go to the developing world. You can even choose which charity your dollars go towards as\u00a0every beer, wine, cider and margherita sale sends\u00a0a donation back to the drinks country of origin. While you might not recognise many of the beer or wine labels, as all the proceeds go towards a good cause you may as well try a few.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amelbournite.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/photo-2-39.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1270\" src=\"https://amelbournite.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/photo-2-39.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300\" alt=\"SheBeenBar_Melbourne\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<p>Speaking of boozing&#8230;.. By the time we arrived we were starving and looking a little crazy eyed for some wine. I&#8217;d heard Shebeen had\u00a0mulled wine on the menu for winter and it did not disappoint. Large metal flasks were placed down in front of us and filled to the brim with a fruity and spicy mulled wine.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amelbournite.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/photo-3-36.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1269\" src=\"https://amelbournite.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/photo-3-36.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300\" alt=\"SheBeenBar_Melbourne\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<p>For dinner I ordered my favourite dish, organic black bean noodle salad with a miso lime dressing, pistachios, slivered almonds and a side of smoked tofu\u00a0served with roasted eggplant. The miso lime dressing is deliciously tangy and together with the crunchy nuts\u00a0balances out what\u00a0otherwise could be quite bland noodles.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amelbournite.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/photo-4-29.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1268\" src=\"https://amelbournite.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/photo-4-29.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" alt=\"SheBeenBar_Melbourne\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\n<p>My fellow diner ordered three of the sliders &#8211;\u00a0pork belly, Mexican pulled pork and shredded BBQ beef. The pork belly was picked as the favourite for its crunchy crackling and the BBQ beef the least as it was a little overpowered by the mayo.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amelbournite.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/photo-4-30.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1267\" src=\"https://amelbournite.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/photo-4-30.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" alt=\"Organic black bean noodle salad with miso  lime dressing, pistachios and slivered almonds\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\n<p>Shebeen&#8217;s food and drinks are\u00a0reasonably priced and they&#8217;re open from lunch until the wee hours of the morning Monday to Saturday.

To go with my nuts I had my first ever Acai Bowl &#8211; pistachio and dried berry granola with poached pear, Acai sorbet, housemade coconut berry yoghurt and cacao nibs.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amelbournite.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/photo-4-50.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1376\" src=\"https://amelbournite.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/photo-4-50.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300\" alt=\"LBSS\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<p>I never quite understood all the fuss about acai bowls but I totally get it now. The coconut yoghurt was light and frothy and more like cream in texture. The acai sorbet was thick like ice-cream\u00a0with lots of crunch from the granola. I felt like I was\u00a0eating ice-cream and cream for breakfast. A double win of delicious\u00a0and healthy.</p>\n<p>LBSS is a little pricier than your average brunch spot but they don&#8217;t skimp on portions or quality. There&#8217;s not a huge amount of seating available so I wouldn&#8217;t recommend taking a large group on a weekend.</p>\n<p>On another note as a solo diner I found the staff to be some of the friendliest I&#8217;ve met. When you&#8217;re out by yourself it&#8217;s easy for wait staff to dismiss you to a corner but every staff member stopped to ask me how my day was going, what I thought of the food and if I needed more coffee. Big thumbs up.</p>\n<p>Was it worth the walk? Most definitely. I&#8217;ll be back to try the Rainbow Roots Salad and Freekakes &#8211; with a side of bacon.

I&#8217;m on a\u00a0personal mission to try every kind of\u00a0fruit toast\u00a0in the city. It&#8217;s a hard task but someone&#8217;s gotta do it. So far the leader is <a title=\"CHAI CHALLENGE #2 \u2013 STOVETOP\" href=\"http://amelbournite.wordpress.com/2014/04/28/chai-challenge-2-stovetop/\" target=\"_blank\">Stovetop</a>. It&#8217;s super nutty and dense, more the texture of cake but that&#8217;s never a bad thing.</p>\n<p>Back to Barry. The fruit toast came with whipped spiced orange ricotto and butter. Lots of butter. The whipped ricotta was balanced nicely by the spiced orange &#8211; neither too sweet or tart. The same could be said for the fruit and nut toast which came out in thick slices with an emphasis on spice rather than sugar.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amelbournite.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/photo-5-9.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1374\" src=\"https://amelbournite.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/photo-5-9.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300\" alt=\"BARRY\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<p>I did get my coffee &#8211; \u00a0an\u00a0almond milk flat white. My experience with almond milk coffees is pretty limited but this so far ranks as the best I&#8217;ve had. It\u00a0was as full bodied and creamy as a dairy coffee, something which is often lacking in non-dairy milk drinks.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amelbournite.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/photo-2-50.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1371\" src=\"https://amelbournite.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/photo-2-50.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300\" alt=\"BARRY\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<p>Service was friendly and surprisingly quick given how busy the cafe was at lunchtime. \u00a0The Californian superfood salad, raw falafel, crisp prawn sub with kewpie mayo and\u00a0peanut butter and tomatoes on toast all caught my eye on the menu. It&#8217;s different to your average brunch spot with the usuals given a twist and with plenty of options that cater to any diet.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amelbournite.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/photo-2-4.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1367\" src=\"https://amelbournite.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/photo-2-4.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300\" alt=\"BARRY\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re yet to visit Barry, make it your next stop for some of the\u00a0freshest and tastiest food around.</p>\n<p><b>B.<br />\n</b>B A R R Y coffee and food<br />\n85 High Street, Northcote<b><br />\n</b><a href=\"http://barrycoffeeandfood.com/\" target=\"_blank\">barrycoffeeandfood.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/71/1784367/restaurant/Melbourne/Barry-Northcote\"><img style=\"border:none;width:130px;height:36px;\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.urbanspoon.com/b/link/1784367/minilink.gif\" alt=\"Barry on Urbanspoon\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 1398, "location": false, "date": "08-12-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["winter activities", "weekend", "Joost Bakker"], "text": "<p>Is it just me or does the weather seem to be getting <em>slightly</em> warmer?

The veggies of the day were radishes and brussel sprouts to our very pleasant surprise. Yes, I enjoy offal and brussel sprouts &#8211; guess my heritage!

Firstly,\u00a0after over studying Tim Winton&#8217;s many works during primary and highschool I wouldn&#8217;t list myself as his biggest fan. This is of course not Mr Winton&#8217;s fault but more a fault of the WA Curriculum which at that time found an Australian author and stuck rigidly to his work. In one year I studied one of his short stories 3 times in different classes. THREE TIMES.<br />\nSecondly, my experience with opera is limited, probably the most out of all of the art forms of theatre, musical theatre, ballet, music\u00a0etc. As much as I know there is more to opera than old, fat people singing in Latin, going into my first Victorian Opera show I still struggled to\u00a0shake the stereotype.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amelbournite.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/photo-15.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1635\" src=\"https://amelbournite.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/photo-15.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300\" alt=\"TheRiders\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<p>Fortunately within about 30 seconds of the The Riders I knew I was in for a an excellent ride (ha). The synopsis is fairly simple &#8211; Scully is waiting for his wife, Jennifer, and daughter, Billie, to return from a holiday in Perth to their home in Ireland. But it&#8217;s only Billie that arrives at the airport\u00a0leading Scully, with his daughter \u00a0in tow, to go on a desperate search through Europe to find his wife. At times a little strange and raising questions and ideas of lost love\u00a0and hope I won&#8217;t give too much more away.\u00a0I spent some time after the show discussing\u00a0the characters and their journeys so if you do see the show, please let me know what you think!</p>\n<p>The talent on and off stage was exceptional. The cast are talented far beyond anything I could hope to achieve and I&#8217;m in no position to comment on their vocal ability! The set design\u00a0was simple, as expected in most contemporary theatre, but striking\u00a0with use of a revolving stage to add movement, drama\u00a0and fluidity between scenes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amelbournite.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/photo-25.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1634\" src=\"https://amelbournite.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/photo-25.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300\" alt=\"TheRiders\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<p>At 1 hour 40 minutes the opera moves through the 3 acts efficiently and the lack of an intermission isn&#8217;t missed.</p>\n<p>Walking out of\u00a0The Riders I had lost all of my initial reservations. A refreshing interpretation of Tim Winton&#8217;s work the opera has even encouraged me to read his novel\u00a0&#8211; my first Winton novel in nearly 10 years! &#8211; and of course any remaining stereotypes about opera are long gone. I even found myself fondly recognising Winton-ism&#8217;s in the lyrics (which are displayed as sub-titles throughout the show).</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d highly, highly recommend this show for new and old opera fans. I&#8217;m always so encouraged to see strong talent coming out of Australia and with this show adapted by an Australian, based on work by an Australian author and starring Australians in an Australian company &#8211; you can&#8217;t get much more local than that.</p>\n<p><strong>The Riders</strong><br />\n23 Sept &#8211; 4 Oct<br />\nMalthouse Theatre<br />\nMelbourne<br />\n<a href=\"http://malthousetheatre.com.au/whats-on/the-riders\" target=\"_blank\">malthousetheatre.com.au/whats-on/the-riders</a></p>\n", "post_id": 1629, "location": false, "date": "09-24-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Melbourne", "Grand Final", "Abbotsford Convent", "weekend wanderings", "Hawthorn Hawks"], "text": "<p>I just realised I start nearly every &#8216;Weekend Wandering&#8217; with comments about the weather&#8230;. #sorrynotsorry.

Image courtesy <a href=\"http://www.cindylane.com.au\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.cindylane.com.au</a></p></div>\n<p>Since November 23rd, 2013 Perth has held the spot for the <a href=\"http://world.time.com/2014/01/10/the-worlds-deadliest-place-for-shark-attacks-tries-to-figure-out-how-to-stop-them/\" target=\"_blank\">deadliest place in the world</a> for shark attacks, a statistic us Perthians hold with a strange kind of pride.</p>\n<p>In response to these attacks the Western Australian government, under Premier Colin Barnett, has introduced a catch-and-kill shark policy to cull the number of sharks around WA&#8217;s coast. This involves 72 drum line nets (baited hooks attached to flotation devices) placed around eight of Perth&#8217;s most popular beaches and any sharks who are caught will then be killed (if over three metres).</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s put this all in perspective. In the last three years there have been seven fatal shark attacks off WA&#8217;s coast. In 2013 alone there were 162 fatalities/critical injuries from <a href=\"http://www.police.wa.gov.au/Aboutus/Statistics/Crashstatistics/tabid/1073/Default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">road crashes</a>.</p>\n<p>In the 24 years I lived in Perth I only ever had one encounter with a shark. While snorkelling at Rottnest Island fellow snorkeller swam over to tell me there was a small reef shark nearby. She merrily swam away to continue snorkel-gazing while I shot out of the water in what must have been a world record. As much as I was enjoying snorkelling\u00a0I have a huge amount of respect for Mother Nature and didn&#8217;t fancy coming eye-to-snorkel with a shark of any size. I sat on the beach and had an ice-cream instead.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve only ever been to the beach once when it was closed, despite my hundreds of visits, because a shark had been seen by a spotter plane a kilometre or so off the coast. We had fish and chips instead.\u00a0Sharks are well known for their enjoyment of WA&#8217;s sunny shores so if you choose to swim at the beach, you are choosing to swim in their habitat.</p>\n<p>But back to why I really hate this policy: it targets bull sharks, tiger sharks and the great white shark, an Australian icon, and an endangered species with fewer than 3,500 left in the ocean. The great white has a higher protection status than humpback whales! SO WHY ARE WE TRYING TO KILL THEM?</p>\n<p>What we should be working on is how to decrease attacks through research on their behaviour and deterrents. Give scientists the millions spent on this policy, don&#8217;t pay a fisherman <a href=\"http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/western-australia/shark-catchandkill-fisherman-being-paid-5705-a-day/story-fnhocxo3-1226812860599\" target=\"_blank\">$5705 a day</a> to kill sharks. Don&#8217;t set up drum lines with bait and risk attracting more sharks to the area. This kind of reckless policy making is a poorly thought out response to perceived public hysteria. Shark attacks are terrible, even more so when they result in fatalities, but swimming in the ocean is swimming in their yard. If it&#8217;s of such a concern go to a god damn pool.</p>\n<p>Around 7000 people were at Cottesloe beach today protesting the shark culls. An example of &#8216;beachocracy&#8217; as a friend of mine in Perth called in. Protests were held around Australia and even in New Zealand cos we&#8217;re all a little bit mad.</p>\n<p>The shark cull has been criticised by scientists and conservationists as ineffective and detrimental to all marine life but the WA government is still refusing to listen. The drum lines have proven ineffective, catching several undersized tiger sharks (later released), including one which was dead by the time it was found.</p>\n<p>To quote Jeff Hansen, the Managing Director of Sea Sheperd Australia, &#8220;&#8221;We&#8217;ve got a global obligation to protect sharks&#8221; and right now we&#8217;re failing them.</p>\n<p>So get out there, read the links below (I highly recommend The Skewer&#8217;s article), go to a protest, sign the <a href=\"http://www.change.org/en-AU/petitions/the-western-australian-government-call-off-plan-to-cull-sharks-near-wa-beaches\" target=\"_blank\">petition</a>, tell your friends and get a little bit mad.</p>\n<p><strong>Read more about it here:</strong></p>\n<p>Time:\u00a0<a href=\"//world.time.com/2014/01/10/the-worlds-deadliest-place-for-shark-attacks-tries-to-figure-out-how-to-stop-them/#ixzz2s3eNS5Eq\" target=\"_blank\">Sharks: Western Australia Tries to Reduce Attacks</a></p>\n<p>ABCNews: <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-02-01/shark-protests-wa-catch-and-kill-perth/5232480\" target=\"_blank\">WA shark cull: Thousands rally at Cottesloe Beach as catch-and-kill protests ramp up</a></p>\n<p>The Skewer:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.theskewer.com.au/2014/01/shark-cull/\" target=\"_blank\">Sharks to begin human cull off Western Australian coast</a></p>\n", "post_id": 187, "location": false, "date": "02-01-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Melbourne", "summer", "yarn bombing", "street-art", "art"], "text": "<div>\n<p>Melbourne&#8217;s currently sweating it out with some record-breaking heat-waves and a typically Australian summer.

Inspired by the &#8216;pleasure gardens&#8217; of 18th/19th century London, this family-friendly version is home to the Spiegeltent, free street performances, bars, food vendors (Dutch pancakes!) and other carnival fun. If you prefer a more intimate venue &#8211; but one you&#8217;ll be fighting for space after 7pm &#8211; the Urban Orchard in the Cultural Centre is back for another year.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amelbournite.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/photo-13.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-229\" src=\"https://amelbournite.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/photo-13.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" alt=\"Pleasure Gardens\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amelbournite.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/photo-43.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-232\" src=\"https://amelbournite.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/photo-43.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300\" alt=\"photo 4\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not just night-time fun either.

This brings me to my second irritation &#8211; as there are no tickets available you have to buy a $6 Myki card every time you forget yours. I&#8217;ve done well to only forget mine once. $6 for a Myki + $3.50 (minimum) journey cost and thats nearly $10 for a train ride &#8211; Eugh.</p>\n<p>Myki&#8217;s are pretty simple to use. Purchase a Myki for $6 (sold at stations, 7/11, newsagencies), top it up with credit and tag on (and sometimes off) each time you hop on a tram/train/bus.</p>\n<p>The fares differ between Zones, there&#8217;s Zone 1, Zone 1 or 2 and Zone 2. I could list the suburbs included in each but for a far better visual representation take a look at the PTV Zone maps\u00a0<a href=\"http://ptv.vic.gov.au/getting-around/maps/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. In over a year here I&#8217;ve only ever travelled to Zone 2 once and that was to visit IKEA in Springvale &#8211; which is way out past Clayton.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re still wondering why you don&#8217;t need to tag off in Zone 1, here&#8217;s the official response from the Public Transport Victoria website:</p>\n<p><em>&#8220;If you travel by tram within Zone 1 only, you do not need to touch off to pay the lowest fare. If you do not touch off, the system charges a 2 hour Zone 1 myki money fare the next time you touch on. This is the same fare you would pay if you did touch off. If your trip is entirely in Zone 2, you must touch off to pay the Zone 2 fare.&#8221;\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>This means you&#8217;ll only be charged one far for catching a tram multiple times within two hours. It also saves time which brings me to my next point.</p>\n<p>Myki&#8217;s are a little slow. \u00a0Touching on can take a couple of attempts (watch for the green light) and yes, you do want to make sure you&#8217;ve done it right as guards frequently patrol trams &#8211; fines are not your friend. Touching off can also take a couple of attempts which has the potential to cause a pile-up during peak hour if everyone tagged off. Thankfully we don&#8217;t need to.</p>\n<p>You can always avoid Myki&#8217;s entirely by catching one of Melbourne&#8217;s <a href=\"http://ptv.vic.gov.au/route/view/1112\" target=\"_blank\">free trams</a>. The City Circle Tourist Trams circle the city and are free to hop on/off. The trams pass tourist attractions such as Queen Vic Markets, Fitzroy Gardens, Parliament House, Princess Theatre and shopping malls.

Melbourne trams are iconic (we have the third largest network in the world!) and one of the most convenient ways to get around. Although tram routes might seem a little tricky to figure out at first just remember the city is based on a grid with trams running north/south, east/west and you can&#8217;t go too wrong. <a href=\"http://yarratrams.com.au/on-your-smartphone/\" target=\"_blank\">Tram Tracker</a> is a useful and free app for checking what trams are nearby, where they&#8217;re going and how long until the next one arrives \u00a0&#8211; meaning more time in the pub and less time waiting in the rain.</p>\n<p>With a network that dates all the way back to 1885, you can&#8217;t say you&#8217;ve truly experienced Melbourne until you&#8217;ve ridden on a tram.</p>\n<p>But please, please do not tag off in Zone 1.</p>\n<p>Have any other tips for newbies navigating Melbourne&#8217;s public transport network?

The paintings of fruit and parquet patterning are based on Slattery&#8217;s personal interest in Tunisian fruit vendor Mohamed Bouazizi, who sparked the Arab Spring in December 2010 after lighting himself on fire in an act of political self-immolation, and American basketball player Len Bias, considered to be one of the greatest players not to play at a professional level\u00a0who died of a cocaine overdose two days after being drafted to the Boston Celtics in the 1986 NBA Draft. The parquet flooring depicted is\u00a0taken from photos of the unique stadium flooring of the Boston Celtics\u2019 home arena.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amelbournite.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/photo-2-23.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-406\" src=\"https://amelbournite.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/photo-2-23.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300\" alt=\"JacksonSlattery\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<p>The main gallery features life-like paintings of hands and are the result of the artist questioning how much back-story a viewer should be provided with to understand the visual material an artist chooses to use. Slattery filmed a number of conversations between himself and other artists, filming only the hand movements of the conversations, and used these video stills to create his paintings.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amelbournite.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/photo-4-16.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-408\" src=\"https://amelbournite.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/photo-4-16.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300\" alt=\"JacksonSlattery\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<p>Slattery&#8217;s paintings are beautiful and his use of black, not often seen in water colour, is quite striking.

This was a diet approved buckwheat loaf, so I&#8217;m assuming there are some better tasting types out there.

Koalas on average are awake for 4 hours a day and sleep for the remaining 20 hours. This isn&#8217;t because they&#8217;re inherently lazy creatures or they get &#8216;high&#8217; from eucalyptus leaves (their primary food source) but because eucalyptus leaves have such little energy content the amount they eat only gives them enough energy for 4 hours. By keeping koalas awake for longer than 4 hours they have to eat more food &#8211; the more they eat the more they grind down their teeth and if they have no teeth they can&#8217;t eat AND WILL DIE. Moral of the story &#8211; if you&#8217;re ever offered a koala to hold, ask they put it back for a nap. Also they have fierce claws and are known to scratch.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amelbournite.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/13365289905_69838f8339_z.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-580\" src=\"https://amelbournite.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/13365289905_69838f8339_z.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300\" alt=\"PhilipIsland\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amelbournite.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/13365638443_fbc5d03d5c_z.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-578\" src=\"https://amelbournite.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/13365638443_fbc5d03d5c_z.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300\" alt=\"PhilipIsland\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<p>They are ridiculously cute though.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amelbournite.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/13365505543_5677d1db42_z.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-577\" src=\"https://amelbournite.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/13365505543_5677d1db42_z.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300\" alt=\"PhilipIsland\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<p>After spending an hour straining our necks koala-spotting in trees we headed to somewhere a little more friendly on the eyes.\u00a0On the southern tip of the island\u00a0is The Nobbies\u00a0with spectacular coastal views overlooking Seal Rocks, home to Australia&#8217;s largest colony of fur seals.

Did you know that one of the world&#8217;s largest government conservation programs took place on Philip Island? Until the 1980s most of the Summerland Peninsula was covered in\u00a0over 180 houses, shops and motels &#8211;\u00a0unfortunately this was the same area nine penguin colonies called home. By 1985 only one colony survived\u00a0and they were predicted to be gone by 1997. The Victoria government undertook some drastic action and introduced The Penguin Plan including the\u00a0Summerland Estate Buyback Program. For 20 years the government has repurchased every house, store and motel on the Summerland Peninsula and\u00a0allowed them to be demolished to rehabilite the peninsula as a penguin habitat.</p>\n<p>Driving around the Peninsula (only until sunset when all roads are blocked off to let the penguins safely wander back home) you&#8217;ll spot dozens of these little wooden penguin homes, an indication of the number of Little Penguins that call this island home.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amelbournite.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/13365321053_013b49cf79_b.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-585\" src=\"https://amelbournite.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/13365321053_013b49cf79_b.jpg?w=300&#038;h=300\" alt=\"PhilipIsland\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<p>The burrows start off looking like little boxes and end up like the picture below &#8211; covered in vegetation.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amelbournite.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/13365572434_781d2e7801_b.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-584\" src=\"https://amelbournite.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/13365572434_781d2e7801_b.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300\" alt=\"PhilipIsland\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As for the highlight of my day &#8211; the Penguin Parade! At Summerland Beach you can watch some of the thousands of Little Penguins that return home every night waddle their way up the beach and to their burrows. As no cameras are allowed once the &#8216;parade&#8217; starts (flash can damage their eyes), this is the only picture I was able to take. Summerland Beach\u00a0has around 1000 penguins come ashore every night with a total of 6000 at beaches all around the Peninsula.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amelbournite.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/13365368115_3854532e99_b.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-587\" src=\"https://amelbournite.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/13365368115_3854532e99_b.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" alt=\"PhilipIsland\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\n<p>As the sun set we sat in the dark waiting and anxiously watching the surf. Just after 8pm, their expected arrival time, we heard distinct quacking in the surf and the first few penguins were spotted. They&#8217;re nervous little creatures. Rows of white bellies would pop up in the surf before the penguins would form a tight huddle and slowly shuffle forward debating whether or not to retreat to the safety of the surf. Once they&#8217;re ashore you&#8217;re able to follow a group as they waddle up the hills. Fenced in paths keep the humans closed in and let the penguins\u00a0do their thing without the risk of someone trying to touch them. It was absolutely magical in the dark and any concerns about the on/off rain was quickly forgotten once the first penguins were spotted on the beach.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re yet to venture beyond Melbourne and the Yarra Valley, put Philip Island\u00a0on your &#8216;must see&#8217;\u00a0list asap.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amelbournite.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/13365367325_12f47de9b7_b.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-583\" src=\"https://amelbournite.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/13365367325_12f47de9b7_b.jpg?w=300&#038;h=89\" alt=\"PhilipIsland\" width=\"300\" height=\"89\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>A Good Day For A Waddle<br />\n</strong>Philip Island<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.visitphillipisland.com/\" target=\"_blank\">www.visitphillipisland.com</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "post_id": 546, "location": false, "date": "03-27-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["city", "bars", "Melbourne", "theatre", "cocktails", "drinks"], "text": "<p>My usual art-gallery partner in crime is leaving Melbourne soon to travel and teach in China.

A little hit and miss at times but there were enough belly laughs to almost make up for the lack of burlesque. Almost.</p>\n<p>Not that I needed another reason to return to The Butterfly Club after seeing the bar and foyer but I will definitely be back in the near future for another show.

Also my standard hangover order of poached eggs on toast with mushrooms and avocado isn&#8217;t too hard to picture. Although I&#8217;m no hard-core foodie I do have a few comments about the food:</p>\n<p>Pros:<br />\n&#8211; Herb mushrooms were excellent &#8211; order them as a side even if you get the bircher.<br />\n&#8211; Commendable serving size of avocado. Plated as an entire half scooped out of its skin, when you&#8217;re paying $4 for avocado it&#8217;s good to see you&#8217;re getting (nearly) your money&#8217;s worth.</p>\n<p>Cons:<br />\n&#8211; Poached eggs on toast came as two eggs on one standard size piece of toast. Now I&#8217;m a one egg per piece of toast kinda girl so it really irks me when cafes short serve you on the bread. If I&#8217;m paying $9 for eggs on toast I&#8217;d like to get a little bit more for my money.</p>\n<p>Would I go back? Definitely, although it&#8217;s certainly not the cheapest cafe around the menu is interesting enough (Fat Bacon Toasty, yes please) to tempt me for another visit or two.</p>\n<p><strong>Stagger into Stagger Lee&#8217;s<br />\n</strong><span style=\"color:#000000;\">276 Brunswick Street \u00a0</span><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Fitzroy</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/71/1824278/restaurant/Melbourne/Stagger-Lees-Fitzroy\"><img style=\"border:none;width:130px;height:36px;\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.urbanspoon.com/b/link/1824278/minilink.gif\" alt=\"Stagger Lee's on Urbanspoon\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 724, "location": false, "date": "04-15-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Melbourne", "food", "bake sale", "Fitzroy"], "text": "<p>If there&#8217;s one thing\u00a0I like more than a dance-off, it&#8217;s a bake-off.</p>\n<p>After\u00a0spending Saturday night in several dance-offs, there was no way I was missing the carb delights of Flour Market Easter Bake Sale.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amelbournite.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/fm03_03_lineup.gif\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-752\" src=\"https://amelbournite.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/fm03_03_lineup.gif?w=300&#038;h=300\" alt=\"FlourMarket\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<p>Anticipating huge queues and with the lure of crumpets and bagels I roll&#8217;d\u00a0out of bed to be at Fitzroy Town Hall by 10am.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amelbournite.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/13816109105_5d824e2f7e_b.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-712\" src=\"https://amelbournite.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/13816109105_5d824e2f7e_b.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300\" alt=\"FlourMarket\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>Fortunately the hall was surprisingly clear.

And pork hock\u00a0can mean an entire pig.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amelbournite.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/13990425172_baf3080f28_b.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-766\" src=\"https://amelbournite.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/13990425172_baf3080f28_b.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300\" alt=\"LaCholita\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<p>Back to our reunion.

need 2-3 days to see all the touristy highlights.\u00a0It&#8217;s easy enough to explore the city yourself with a tuk-tuk driver but to learn a\u00a0little more history about the city\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.urbanadventures.com/destination/phnom_penh_tours\" target=\"_blank\">Urban Adventures </a>offer great day tours.</p>\n<p>If you want to head out of the city and explore the countryside I highly recommend\u00a0<a href=\"http://grasshopperadventures.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Grasshopper Adventures</a>\u00a0cycling tours. I did The Oudong Trail &#8211; ask for Amon!</p>\n<p>Some of the best food I had on my trip was from <a href=\"http://www.tree-alliance.org/index.asp\" target=\"_blank\">TREE Alliance</a> training restaurants Friends the Restaurant and Romdeng. The organisation provides training and support for some of Cambodia&#8217;s most disadvantaged youths and the food at their restaurants is outstanding. \u00a0Try the fish amok and if you&#8217;re feeling brave the tarantulas. They also run a beauty salon and shop next door to Friends which is worth having a look at for\u00a0souvenirs.</p>\n", "post_id": 933, "location": false, "date": "06-16-2014", "mentions": [],

R. Martin</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p><em><img class=\"alignright\" alt=\"A Game of Thrones by George R. R.

Martin</em> had been in my to-read list of books for quite a long time. I generally prefer ebooks over paperbacks. But for this one, I always had a feeling that I should read it in paperback. Its essence is one of the main reasons, plus its length is also a matter of interest. This epic fantasy is followed by four more books in the series called <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> which is an ongoing series. There is also a television series based on the title <em>A Game of Thrones</em>, in which I am not interested as it\u2019s not my habit to follow up a <span class=\"GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct\">tele</span> series. \u00ad</p>\n<p>I completed this book in six days and in my normal reading hours (My reading hours varies from 30 minutes to as much time as I get). Though the length of this book is quite long, but once you start reading it you will sense the how fast-read it is. The story is quite <span class=\"GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct\">pacey</span> too. Sometimes you won\u2019t even sense there is a climax coming and when it strikes\u2026 <em>BOOM!</em></p>\n<p>The shifting of the focus back and forth between the characters and the group of characters, specifically the families <span class=\"GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct\">is</span> quite enjoyable. The plot is at its best. Sometimes you may feel something is coming, and it\u2019s the <em>Winter</em>. <em>Winter is coming</em>.</p>\n<p>Mostly books in fantasy genre lack the quality of writing which I have experienced, and immaturity could be seen in words with the naked eye. But Martin succeeds in many of those areas where so many others have failed. Sometimes a book having too many characters and jumping from character to character is quite unreadable or quite boring. But Martin\u2019s ability to tell a story is so good that I started to look forward to these jumps to different characters. Characters were also forced into making unpleasant choices that they\u2019d rather not make as it goes against their morals but they do make a choice because it\u2019s necessary. I like that. \u2018Cause the consequences occurred due to the choices made by a character is what excites a reader. This makes a reader stick to the book.</p>\n<p>I was fascinated by two characters, <em>Ned Stark</em> and<em> Daenerys Targaryen</em>. Which is what is making me to go <span class=\"GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct\">for</span> the next book <em>A Clash of Kings</em>.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ll recommend this book especially to a fantasy fan. I know some might think that this one is over-hyped because it has a <span class=\"GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct\">tele</span> series, but my friends go for it. Don\u2019t look for the dark side. Read it. It\u2019s worth reading.</p>\n", "post_id": 1073, "location": false, "date": "07-23-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Reading", "book review", "Family", "author", "Read", "ebook", "Father", "TARDIS", "Fiction", "write", "Imagination", "Book", "books", "Amandeep Mittal", "Imagine", "Writing", "Poetry", "ebooks"], "text": "<p>It felt I was going to meet my father after a long periodic time. I was excited but also nervous. Meetings with my father always gave me butterflies in my stomach. Due to the past experience, our meetings were always short and premature. We either end up on calmly disagreeing with each other or end up arguing on idiotic situations. His ways, my ways were quite different. Of course, they would be. After all we were two different human beings. But he still supported me. He compromised with his own time and space, and devoted his whole for me. I have always felt a question in my mind, would he had not been my father, what in the hell would I have done with myself? You see, I was that dependent on him still pretending to the outer world and myself that I am independent. We all are, dependent on our parents due to some reasons. And we do not need reasons to depend on them. Those reasons are just a blur of words, the real reason which I realize is their love for us and the love they expect even though they won&#8217;t tell us that they\u00a0crave for it. I knew I would be his offspring as long as I am a material.</p>\n<p>The meeting with him this time was different. He did not come to pick me up. Instead, he sent his car. When I came home, I was cheerfully greeted by my mother. And I felt those butterflies were bygones. But then I saw him, and they come back in an instant. I saw him, he had a smile on his face as he always did, even during those times of despair and pain which I gave him or at the time of life which we fought together. I conquered most of the life because he helped me to do it.</p>\n<p>I saw him, his decaying face. I could say that cause I bore his blood in my veins. His eyes were filled with those gloomy clouds you must have seen. They just come out of the weather and it never rains. The wind blows them away. But this time, I saw there was no wind. Even the strong west wind which when strikes and blows, material things feel some despair, felt weak. I saw he had grown small, his face was dull and short, and skinny. His black mustache was as white as snow but there was no mountain to hold it up. His voice had grown weaker since I last saw him.</p>\n<p>I realized I could have spent all those years with him such that we could have fought against life some more days together. Such that his smile would still have been cheerful and one of the happiest smile. I knew he missed me and I did too. All those bad and sad butterflies were now in my head. As if they can travel even faster than my thoughts. After watching him struggle to stand from his chair and greet me with his hug which was still warm and reminded me of the previous ones. All his hugs were that strong and warm and I always felt my self-esteem boosted as there was someone for me always. This moment I only feel I could time travel back, <span class=\"GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct\">wish</span> had a TARDIS, would hug him each and every day that I have missed.</p>\n<p>By feeling the essence of his presence I was still care free and well protected from the demons of the world. I saw his eyes were looking straight in my eyes and I saw he felt and understood well each and every thought I was having right now in my mind.</p>\n<p>Finally those words came out of my mouth, &#8220;Dad, I love you&#8221;.</p>\n<p>He smiled. And this time I saw one of the happiest smile I had ever seen.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>It was just a dream, I feel the essence of the dream is enough to teach a man.</em></p>\n", "post_id": 1089, "location": false, "date": "07-30-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Reading", "books", "Lord of the rings"], "text": "<p>Lord Of The Rings- The Fellowship of the Ring</p>\n<blockquote><p>One ring  to rule them all, One ring to find them, One ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them</p></blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://amandeepmittal.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/2012617222337.jpg\" style=\"height:666px;width:500px;\" /></p>\n", "post_id": 112, "location": false, "date": "06-17-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["The Two Towers", "two towers", "The Felloship of the ring", "lord of the ring", "fellowship of the ring", "LOTR", "Review", "The Lord of the Rings", "Frodo", "Book", "The retrun of the king", "return of the king"], "text": "<p><em>The Lord of The Rings</em> is often erroneously called a trilogy, though it is not so.

Delicacy what makes a reader thinks that it is a certain masterpiece and thus delicacy comes from the peculiar Tolkien.

The pace of the book is as usual but the plotting suffers.\u00a0This book really feels like the second of a series of books, which means it&#8217;s mostly setting up events that will come around in the next installments. Also it lacked a bit of action that was expected after reading the first book or as the title suggests. I have a mixed &#8211; bag feeling towards this one. I also felt, once the plot will take you to the point of full excitement and something big to happen, but when you turn the next page it was just a pit of disappointment. I won&#8217;t be highlighting the events as they \u00a0would be spoiled.</p>\n<p><em>Daenerys Targaryen,\u00a0</em>which I liked one of the most in the first book, was\u00a0<span class=\"GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct\">quite</span>\u00a0a\u00a0drag-on in this one.

They are short, short stories. Generally consists of 500 to 750 words. Well, if you think writing that many words is easy for you, think again. If you still think it is easy for you, well try to the limit. In my research a\u00a0<em>Flash Fiction\u00a0</em>does not exceed 1,000 words.</p>\n<p><strong>Short Story</strong> which is something between a\u00a0<em>Flash Fiction\u00a0</em>and a<em>\u00a0Novella</em>. I love reading short stories. They give me enough to really satisfy my curiosity about the character and plot, bringing the story to a dynamic conclusion\u2014all without leaving my chair once. That\u2019s the hallmark of a short story. You should be able to read it in one sitting.</p>\n<p>Normally, a\u00a0<em>short story</em> range from 1,000 to 10,000 words but the genre also has a big part in it.</p>\n<p><strong>Novella</strong>. Five years back if you would ask me what a\u00a0<em>Novella\u00a0</em>is, I might have not known. And I have never written one. The length\u00a0gives you room for more characters and more story. It pulls up short of a novel, making it the perfect size for avid readers with a short attention span.</p>\n<p>Some writers want to call\u00a0their 50,000 or 60,000 word manuscripts a novel. The culprit of this is probably National Novel Writing Month.\u00a0It challenges you to write a novel in a month. The goal is 50,000 words. But if you ask a publishing company they would underline the words that\u00a0\u00a0minimum is usually 80,000 words and can go as high as 240,000. But then we have the genre thing again.</p>\n<p><strong>Micro Fiction</strong>. It is tiny. Generally about the length of a\u00a0<em>Tweet</em> or maybe a little longer than that.</p>\n<p>Hopefully, my explanation of the specific terms was informative.</p>\n", "post_id": 1261, "location": false, "date": "08-31-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Ivan Turgenev", "Poetry", "Fiction", "Romance", "Book", "books", "Reading", "G K Chesterton", "ebooks", "Read", "Thomas Hardy", "Joseph Conrad", "crime fiction", "poets", "literature", "ebook", "Dante", "English", "poems", "Divine Comedy", "tragedy", "Italian", "drama", "John Milton", "Epic Poetry", "Authors", "E-book", "Epic Fiction"], "text": "<p><img alt=\"NEW BUYS- CLASSICS\" src=\"https://amandeepmittal.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/wp_000014.jpg?w=1166&#038;h=1555\" width=\"1166\" height=\"1555\" /></p>\n<p>Finally the most awaited order of this month has arrived.

Hmm&#8230; Well, surely I must have been a small kid with the curiosity of childhood. Nevertheless, I remember when I bought my first book. I was in third standard then. I remember the incident clearly. There was a book fair for a week in my school (my school always had them) and we use to get a leaflet containing the name a brief description and the pricing of the book. I showed that leaflet to my father after the dinner and I think he agreed and gave me money. Next day came early, and I was blooming with the excitement. I remember the book, it is still there on my shelf. Though, I don&#8217;t remember finishing it.</p>\n<p>I have been keeping a record of the books and their authors I have read since my school days. They are numbered as I read them. The number is a secret, I would share that someday if I reach the milestone of 500 or maybe 1000.</p>\n<p>I quite clearly remember the first book I read. It was a classic, <em><strong>Treasure Island</strong> </em><em>by <strong>Robert Louis</strong><strong> Stevenson</strong></em><strong> </strong>and I must have been in my seventh standard. That is the only <em><strong>Stevenson&#8217;s</strong> </em>book I have read till date. I remember glancing over shelves of my school library to explore more and more innovative and fresh new worlds. The dust, the smell of old paper, the colorful covers and the hardbound covers. At one time, I did explore some books in my library which were not issued to anyone in last eight years. Even my librarian did not know about them.</p>\n<p>Since then, I have been an avid reader. I don&#8217;t stick or read only one genre, as I love to try and read different genres. But I do have my favorites one. People always complain that they don&#8217;t get time to read but they do want to read. Well there is an advice for them, <em>you will never get time to read till you seek it. Make reading a part of your day to day activities, like those you do daily and never forget them to do. It will help you.</em> I have been reading and keeping it in my list of day to day activities from the past six years.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em>\u201cI have always imagined that Paradise will be a kind of library.\u201d \u2014 Jorge Luis Borges</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>So my friends, which was your first book?</strong></p>\n", "post_id": 1309, "location": false, "date": "09-16-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Reviews", "David Ellis", "author", "book review", "James Patterosn", "Read", "Review", "ebook", "Fiction", "psychological", "Book", "books", "Amandeep Mittal", "crime fiction", "book reviews", "Authors", "Reading", "thriller", "ebooks"], "text": "<p><img class=\"alignright\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/cdn2-b.examiner.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_content_width/hash/d9/aa/d9aaff635a7401cda11bb5b34ebbe8ba.jpg?itok=QEVfYhvd\" width=\"184\" height=\"280\" />This was my seventh <em>James Patterson&#8217;s</em> book and I would say he writes better when he is not co-authoring. There were times when I read his <em>Alex Cross</em>&#8216; series or <em>Women&#8217;s Mystery Club</em> series and when I read his <em>Private </em>series or the <em>Mistress</em>. The difference\u00a0would\u00a0be in front of you.

It\u00a0is just\u00a0<span class=\"GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct\">not his class</span> or I would say, it&#8217;s not him. It&#8217;s a disgrace the way his books are written nowadays.\u00a0<em><span class=\"GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct\">Mistress</span></em> being lengthy novel of 448 pages, the plot and the story are acceptable however the way of telling the story, the way of portraying the first person narrative was not good at all. Actually it was pretty bad, no reader would like to read the way this book is written.</p>\n<p>In the past, I have always enjoyed Patterson&#8217;s books immensely. I used to like his style of short chapters and page turning\u00a0essence his books had but now it seem,\u00a0<em>What the hell am I reading? It&#8217;s better if I read my textbooks</em>.</p>\n<p>After reading 100 pages you would realize that the main character of the book,\u00a0<em>Ben</em>, might be an interesting character in this psychological thriller but reading further you will realize that before you just had a bad thought. Though I agree, it&#8217;s a fast read but I had to force myself to finish it. The character of <i>Ben</i> often goes\u00a0\u00a0on and on about mundane facts which have nothing to do at all with the storyline. And due to this he is an annoying character. I am disappointed with this one. Looks like, I&#8217;ll have to go back to <em>Alex Cross</em> or <em>Women&#8217;s Mystery Club</em>.</p>\n<p>I would advise not to buy and waste your money.

Many a times, the reader would be astonished by the way of illustrations\u00a0<em>Thomas Hardy\u00a0</em>provides in this particular title. The way he pulled images, I was bewitched by his art.</p>\n<p><em>Far from the Madding Crowd</em>\u00a0is basically the story of Bathsheba Everdene and how her three suitors affect her life.\u00a0Looking at the protagonist Bathsheba Everdene, considering her wit and intelligence how she ends up choosing to marry the worst of the three suitors is hard to imagine. But that&#8217;s what drives the plot forward. Otherwise, this book would have been ended in just two or three pages. Following the protagonist\u00a0made me think about how little we know about that special someone we marry.</p>\n<p>The book provides few little queries at some point or other and it is necessary to understand the motive and think for an answer to it. Especially, that point where he talks about \u2018<i>how</i> <em>woman may be treated in\u00a0bitterness&#8217;</em>. Also, there is a lot of psychological insight about human nature and how we often make the wrong choices based on superficiality.</p>\n<p>The characterization is thorough and well maintained till the end.\u00a0<em>Hardy\u00a0</em>clearly shows how even a small character can define and refine the plot. Even the titles of the chapters were well written and make a huge difference on how the plot is advancing fashioning up the curiosity of reader to read more.</p>\n<p>I would say the book was not much of a heavy read, is enjoyable\u00a0to read when you are in the mood for a classic or some pastoral mayhem.</p>\n", "post_id": 1418, "location": false, "date": "10-03-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["detective", "Ivan Turgenev", "mulliner nights", "Classic", "pg wodehouse", "ebook", "Fiction", "Book", "books", "Amandeep Mittal", "Authors", "ebooks"], "text": "<p><img src=\"https://amandeepmittal.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/savedpicture-20131050319.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full;\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://amandeepmittal.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/savedpicture-201310503115.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full;\" /></p>\n", "post_id": 1424, "location": false, "date": "10-04-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["essay", "Philosophizing", "story", "ebook", "author", "short", "Review", "philosophy", "Authors", "Writing", "Read", "Book", "books", "Amandeep Mittal", "crime fiction", "article", "Reading", "ebooks", "E-book", "E-books"], "text": "<p><img class=\"alignright\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.phlmetropolis.com/Road%20less%20traveled.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" />On an early August morning, wandering alone on the crispy and crumby dead leaves I felt sharp rays of sun appearing betwixt the naked branches of trees. The trees appeared as some broken mannequins, their faces totally blank in aspect to show an expression that if ever a brainy mind ever groom in them or do they have brainless mind already? I felt even if I stand all day long and just stare them, they will still be blank just like the current state of humanity. People don&#8217;t react on the consequences and events they should but they do overreact on when they should show least of the interest.</p>\n<p>Squirrels were hovering hither and thither trees to hide themselves beneath the shadow of leaves. And they failed to find any. Just like those sinners who try to hide behind someone as if to blame him of their own sins and feeling of guilt. Do sinners even have the feeling of guilt, I wonder? It&#8217;s an odd habit among us humans and an old one too, which the with ages being passed, we, humans\u00a0\u00a0have to failed to change in ourselves despite how drastically we have changed materialistically.</p>\n<p>This lonely path was unclear and far away had a blurry glimpse of what might come but still I wandered barefooted just like the humanity is living through centuries. With the every step I took, a monotonous effect of sound came from crumbling of the dead leaves. I usually encountered some small pointed pebbles which would pinch right through the skin like through the soul, only to make it hard and to suffer from severe pain for an instance. I wondered, humanity is like this only. No matter how many centuries we had endured we still are unable to omit small-small negative notions in our society and day to day living which eventually effect us in bigger sense.

So I also wanted to try a new author and I was in a mood of reading something different so I went for it. The book has a good plot, goes monotonous a bit clumsy in the middle but a good ending. The story evolves around the times where ideologies as Materialism, Nihilism and Marxism just were &#8220;infants&#8221; and clashed with the old aristocratic thinking. That&#8217;s why I felt\u00a0<em>Turgenev</em> could have written <em>Fathers and Sons</em> without any mention of Bazarov\u2019s nihilistic beliefs; it doesn&#8217;t strengthen Bazarov\u2019s argument for the welfare of the serfs, and makes him an easy target for Arkady\u2019s uncle Pavel Petrovich to dismiss him as arrogant, flippant and egoistic, characteristics attributed to youth and not the workings of a man of wisdom.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I can&#8217;t write more about it as it has nothing much in it but I feel is essential book to read of you&#8217;re reading Russian Literature.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">My favorite quote from the book:\u00a0<em>&#8220;Every single man hangs by a thread, a bottomless pit can open beneath him any minute, and yet he still goes on thinking up unpleasantness for himself and making a mess of his life.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\n", "post_id": 1452, "location": false, "date": "10-11-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Review", "Fiction", "Book", "Reading", "Markus Zusak", "ebooks", "death", "book review", "author", "Read", "Stalingrad", "the book thief", "literature", "ebook", "Historical", "World War", "German", "Liesel Meminger", "books", "Amandeep Mittal", "Nazi", "E-book"], "text": "<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>THE BOOK\u00a0THIEF</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">by\u00a0<strong><em>Markus Zusak</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em><img class=\"alignright\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/cache0.bdcdn.net/assets/images/book/medium/9780/5527/9780552773898.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"215\" /></em>The extraordinary\u00a0<em>New York Times Bestseller\u00a0</em>for 230 weeks must be on your reading list this year. This book is a treasure, a modern\u00a0<em>classic</em>\u00a0I would say. Set during the time of Nazi Germany and World War II, it tells the story about a foster girl, Liesel Meminger with a fine and an extraordinaire narrative by\u00a0<em>Death.\u00a0</em>The narration was one of the reasons I picked this book due to the immense curiosity, I can say I am completely satisfied and I have read after along time, a totally satisfying book. It leaves with a mysterious thrill which is hard to define in words and can only be experienced if you read it. The book is very well structured. It seems all perfect due to the intensive narration of the <em>Death&#8217;s\u00a0</em>perspective.\u00a0<em>Markus Zusak\u00a0</em>is impressing in this one.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em></em>The narrative,\u00a0<em>Death</em>, in not some kind of boring grim reaper with a scythe. He&#8217;s a jolly character, tries to enjoy himself and is always indulged in his work. His role is a strong one, and in\u00a0some ways he makes himself a slave of humans \u2013 dealing with the impact of their wars and atrocities as he is\u00a0<i>always haunted by humans</i>. A reader&#8217;s imagination also has a serious part in coping up with the characters.\u00a0The other characters of Liesel Meminger, Hans Hubermann,\u00a0Rudy Steiner, and Max\u00a0Vandenburg are some\u00a0perks of the book. Each character has its own story as always. I could not find myself falling for one character ( just like The Great Gatsby) which is a good thing as I\u00a0could\u00a0maintain the\u00a0transparency\u00a0of my readership towards the book. Though <em>The Book Thief</em>\u00a0succeeds on the most post-modern of levels, its impact on the reader is as much due to superb old fashioned plot and\u00a0characterization\u00a0as anything else.

The title of the book is in itself is a wonder and a seed of curiosity. Short length, one day read I would call (though due to lack of time, I made it in three days). I got this book randomly when I was hovering around the internet for I had this unsatisfied urge to go for book-shopping for months. Due to it&#8217;s length I picked the book though after reading it I realized it could have been a little more longer for the words just flow through your mind as the book is simply written. The book certainly aims at younger readers and it was interesting to see Hitler from a different perspective and it presented some insightful points to the reader.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">One important fact is that in this book Holocaust is not treated as fiction but as fact. The book is strangely yet appropriately aware of its merging of fact and fiction. The protagonist Mark even wonders thus as he thinks about his friend Anna&#8217;s story about Hitler&#8217;s supposed daughter.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The book is totally worth for school reading.\u00a0It&#8217;s emotionally charged so you could have some great conversations about it in the classroom.

It also give a though on &#8216;bad parents can have good children&#8217;, which is necessary in today&#8217;s world that a child must have an understanding up to the point where he would analyse a situation no matter how emotional the situation can be, I feel. Emotional in the sense of related to his parents.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The ending was the most amazing part. It&#8217;s quite philosophical. It makes you think whether the book is purely fiction or is there some reality.

To establish an atmosphere, as they say, is a vexation in itself. You have to make it perfect, otherwise if you went too long or too short for a start your audience will be smoking joints of boredom instead of cigarettes. You know your boat has sunk before it left the shore. Sometimes there are more cigarette butts in my dustbin then words on the paper resting itself with a blank face. The obligation of a writer is to satisfy his audience and have the stamina to complete his work with wittiness. Wittiness I said, otherwise it would be another one of those in which you are doing a book signing and no body turns up. So you end up giving free copies to your friends, the caf\u00e9 owner at which you prefer to drink your latte (in my case it would be a bartender). Also a complimentary copy to the owner of the bookshop. Then your book will be on a seventy percent discount on some kart or mart website and still no buyer.

He love stories. Telling them is one thing but to live and tell them is astonishing. And how a writer can live in the stories?&#8230; By his imagination. Imagination is infinite. You certainly don&#8217;t have to pay for it. It is legal to use. And it&#8217;s the best thing a human has got, I believe. \u00a0<em>The Name of the Wind .</em>\u00a0At first, I never wanted to read it. But then, when strongly recommended by one of my friend, I borrowed his copy and read it. Now I can say, I can&#8217;t wait to read the second.\u00a0\u00a0<em>The Name of the Wind \u00a0</em>introduce us to\u00a0<em>Kvothe</em>, a figure which is hard to ignore not because he has red hair but because the mysterious intelligence the character has.</p>\n<p>At the start level, the book is slow for a few pages, and it took me sometime to adjust. May be I was reading after a long time. But after reading the book, I read the starting few pages again. And I must say the style used by\u00a0<em>Patrick\u00a0</em>keeps things as simple as possible and he tries to create an enclosure by his words such that if a reader is immerse in his words, he will find hard to emerge out back to reality. The book, I must say, after reading 50-70 pages is very hard to put down. Though they say, the start and the end defines a book, I must correct them, <em>&#8216;their&#8217;</em> saying might work for a story or a novella for they are short in length but for 600 plus page novel like\u00a0<em>The Name of the Wind\u00a0</em>you need to give it some time and at least 50-70 pages might be sufficient to start being judgmental about the book. Most of the times \u00a0this will work for fantasies as they happen to be a bit bulky in the length.</p>\n<p>As I said the story will bind you from it roots and you will be immersed in the world of\u00a0<em>Kvothe</em>. The culture, the geography ,the background of the story and especially my favorite part, the characters, which are developed at such a level that they won&#8217;t disappoint the reader. According to one interview,\u00a0<em>Rothfuss\u00a0</em>spent 14 years in developing this trilogy and I don&#8217;t know the truth, nor am I being judgmental here.</p>\n<p>So I would recommend this book, but then you might end up reading the trilogy.</p>\n<p>3.5 out of 5 from me.</p>\n", "post_id": 1639, "location": false, "date": "12-16-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Non-Fiction", "The name of the wind", "Ian Rankin", "george orwell", "Review", "Poetry", "Game of thrones", "Franz Kafka", "fantasy", "Book", "Sylvia plath", "Reading", "Markus Zusak", "ebooks", "The Sea and the Silence", "Philosophizing", "1984", "book review", "author", "Read", "fitzgerald", "blog", "flash fiction", "a game of thrones", "Authors", "A song of ice and fire", "Writing", "poets", "literature", "Peter Cunningham", "the book theif", "ebook", "crime fiction", "metamorphisis", "Fiction", "the dark road", "kafkaesque", "A clash of kings", "george r r martin", "Patrcik Rothfuss", "ma jian", "the bell jar", "Imagination", "books", "A dance with dragons", "Amandeep Mittal", "the great gatsby", "the unabridged journals of sylvia plath", "peom", "John Rebus", "E-book"], "text": "<p>With\u00a0<em>Top Ten Tuesday meme</em>, I going to discuss\u00a0<strong>Top Ten Authors I read\u00a0</strong>in the year of\u00a0<strong>2013.</strong></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/prettydeadlyreviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/top-ten-tuesday1.jpg\" width=\"643\" height=\"115\" /></p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll start with number\u00a0<strong>10</strong>,\u00a0<strong>MA JIAN,\u00a0</strong>which I picked up randomly and was impressed by his style and the structure and organization of the context, though the length of the book,\u00a0<em>The Dark Road</em>, was quite extensive. But in the end, I was glad I picked him up, and his style is unique and might seem satisfying to a reader if he reads <i>Jian\u00a0</i>for the first time.</p>\n<p>The number\u00a0<strong>9\u00a0</strong>spot, I&#8217;ll give to\u00a0<strong>GEORGE R. R. MARTIN</strong>, whose books I was trying to avoid from quite a long time but couldn&#8217;t resist anymore so I surrendered and I must say the series,\u00a0<em>A Song of Ice and Fire,\u00a0</em>is an impressive epic fantasy and I quite enjoyed them. The length of the books were quite a challenge and thus I had fun conquering it \u00a0and I ended up reading all five books which constitute the series till current date.</p>\n<p><strong><img class=\"alignright\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/tzerisle.squarespace.com/storage/seaandsilence.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1303501802256\" width=\"160\" height=\"240\" />8th\u00a0</strong>spot goes to <strong>PATRICK ROTHFUSS</strong>,\u00a0recently read\u00a0<em>The Name of the Wind,\u00a0</em>which is more satisfying and his style and plot-writing is slightly better than George Martin, in some way, but hey, I am not saying\u00a0<em>Martin</em> is bad or something.\u00a0It was pretty hard for me to choose between the two and I decided\u00a0<em>Rothfuss</em> should go above\u00a0<em>Martin\u00a0</em>as\u00a0<em>Martin</em> disappoints me in the length of his books but hey, he is &#8216;good&#8217;. So is\u00a0<em>Rothfuss</em> and both are great icons of the epic fantasies.</p>\n<p>Number<strong> 7</strong>\u00a0is considered an iconic in the football (soccer) club I prefer to follow, many good players have worn that number during their time at the club, created history, and crafted memories which are unforgettable and became legendary. Such is\u00a0<strong>PETER CUNNINGHAM,\u00a0</strong>an award winning Irish novelist. His historical fiction,\u00a0<em>The Sea and Silence,</em> introduced me to a new level of writing. The level is simple, unique and touches a reader&#8217;s head as well as his heart. It&#8217;s a powerful novel, I would say and I expect him that he continues to create such cherishing novels in future. That&#8217;s why I gave him number\u00a0<em>7</em>, he has the potential.</p>\n<p><strong>6th\u00a0</strong>spot goes to,\u00a0<strong>GEORGE ORWELL</strong>, for writing an exceptional novel based on truth which turned out to be very realistic in future. In our time, and the coming future, the idea his novel,\u00a0<em>1984</em>, implies is a fact, implemented today if not fully, well it will be someday. The way higher authorities want to control people, this novel describe it beautifully also with some thrill.\u00a0<em>Orwell</em>, I salute you for writing such a novel.</p>\n<p><strong></strong>Halfway through the list, and here comes the\u00a0<strong>5th</strong> author.\u00a0<strong>IAN RANKIN</strong>, my all time favorite crime fiction writer in modern day writing. His style, character building and plot structure are all better than others of his own field. I won&#8217;t say their names, but when you read him and then you read them, I am sure you will be able to tell the difference. A Scottish, which, a few years back, I picked out randomly has turned to be one of my favorites. His words mysteriously provides me the motivation to explore more and more and to continue to read.<b><br />\n</b></p>\n<p>The number\u00a0<strong>4</strong> is\u00a0<strong>SCOTT F. FITZGERALD</strong>, one of the American classicist of the jazz age. He flatters me by the philosophy he is uses behind his words and the way he keeps his characters such the the reader will remain, no matter what, neutral. That feeling is something new and unique to experience which only\u00a0<em>Fitzgerald\u00a0</em>can give you.</p>\n<p>Now comes the podium holders:</p>\n<p><strong><img class=\"alignleft\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://amandeepmittal.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/74477-the_book_thief_by_jaystab-d3bema5.jpg?w=129&#038;h=166\" width=\"129\" height=\"166\" />3rd\u00a0</strong>is\u00a0astonishing\u00a0<strong>MARKUS ZUSAK,\u00a0</strong>whose exceptional book,\u00a0<em>The Book Thief,\u00a0</em>made me crazy about him. The only thing I admire in his writing is the way he creates the plot. And after creating the plot he develops the character such that they will fit into the story like they are it&#8217;s own offspring&#8217;s. Hats off to the guy who stayed in\u00a0<em>New York Time Bestseller\u00a0</em>for 230 weeks. He&#8217;s one of those five out five ones.</p>\n<p><strong>2nd\u00a0</strong>is\u00a0<strong>FRANZ KAFKA</strong>, who he is just &#8216;Kafkaesque&#8217;. Powerful, knows how to drag the reader in a motion without letting the reader to realise, and leaves a reader, impressed. He is one of the best European Writers I have ever read. And believe me, he&#8217;s not over-rated.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignright\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/plath.jpg\" width=\"150\" height=\"200\" />And the\u00a0<strong>1st,\u00a0</strong>I have to say, I admire her, her writing, her beautiful mind, she is\u00a0<strong>SYLVIA PLATH</strong>. The first work I read of her was\u00a0<em>The Bell Jar</em>, which was disappointing and I told myself, that&#8217;s not\u00a0<em>Sylvia Plath.</em>\u00a0Then I read many of her poems, and her\u00a0<em>Unabridged\u00a0Journal</em> which made me fell in love her. Through her poems I could \u00a0clearly see the way she used her imagination and how she settled down the words.I could read through her poems and imagine her writing which just feels like reading another book. I seriously felt in love with her writing, and had a fantasy of meeting upon and having a dinner.</p>\n<p>So here completes my\u00a0<em>TOP TEN AUTHORS of 2013. \u00a0</em>I am still exploring some new and reading those old classy writers.

You don&#8217;t have to be depressed right now. &#8216;Cause Fiction does not have to be serious all the time. It can be of &#8216;anything&#8217;. It has many kinds too. But only two general kinds of modern fiction are recognized as:\u00a0<em>Category or Genre Fiction\u00a0</em>and\u00a0<em>Mainstream Fiction.\u00a0Category</em> fiction includes science fiction, suspense, mystery, erotica, Gothic and writers like <em>Edgar Allan Poe</em> and <em>Mark Twain</em> were two category fiction writers. <em>Mainstream</em> writers like <em>Ernst Hemingway</em> and <em>F. Scott Fitzgerald</em> wrote that kind of fiction which does not fit comfortably into one category fiction. Best example of\u00a0<em>mainstream fiction\u00a0</em>is <em>Hemingway&#8217;s</em> &#8216;The Old Man and the Sea&#8217;.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">A newbie writer would and must try to master one or at least two categories of\u00a0<em>category fiction</em> such that then he would be able to to write a well-told<em> mainstream</em> fictitious story. For every reader wants to read well-told story and a writer who doesn&#8217;t enjoy each of word while writing then how can he make others like those words? Also, most modern day readers prefer category fiction such as mystery, fast-paced suspense, erotica, etc. Less reader prefer mainstream fiction. This can be confirmed by looking at any bestseller list in which 70-80% is category fiction.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">So what makes a category fiction. Well there are four basic elements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Plot</li>\n<li>Protagonist and Anti</li>\n<li>Background</li>\n<li>Motivation behind</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Plot, as we all know, is the basic body of any story. If a story does not have a plot there would be no story. Ever\u00a0<em>Shakespeare&#8217;s\u00a0</em>plays have plots. Plot, depends all on writer&#8217;s imagination, and of course they way he develops it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Hero/Heroine and/or Anti-Hero/Villain are the basic characters. A story need to have a hero and in any fiction this is essential. A writer can never write about a character without not focusing on it. Even that character might be a bunch of hair stuck in the drain. The writer will have to analyse and has to spotlight that bunch of hair as to focus on it. That spotlight would be on main character. Having an anti-hero/heroine or a villain is not necessary. I mean to say, not necessary in human form but a villain can a situation or a problem which the hero/heroine has to face in order to complete the plot. There can multiple villains but there cannot be more than one hero. The protagonist can always have a &#8216;side-kick&#8217; or a supporting character or more than one.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Background is an essential part of a story especially if you are writing like science fiction. In science fiction a writer need to set some background for the plot is constructed in the future from the present time. Background needs to strong such that a reader will believe in it. Sometimes, due to background a reader can stick to the whole story thus just to know what lies in the future. Thus, background has a similar functionality of a glue.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Motivation behind the plot and character building always result in a good story. The characterization is always a requirement but the story should not be sacrificed for the sake of a character study. Don&#8217;t spend too much time on analyzing the character to the reader. Get-along with story. Motivation certainly have some further bullet points which I&#8217;ll be discussing in a future post.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">So, stay tuned.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\n", "post_id": 1647, "location": false, "date": "12-19-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["the fault instars", "Non-Fiction", "Review", "Poetry", "Fiction", "fantasy", "Book", "Reading", "ebooks", "john green", "book review", "author", "Read", "blog", "susan minot", "crime fiction", "man booker prize", "thirteen reasons why", "evening", "ebook", "eleanor catton", "jay asher", "the luminaries", "books", "Amandeep Mittal", "Authors", "E-book"], "text": "<p>I&#8217;ve got four new books on my bookshelf right now.

When I am reading a good book, it doesn&#8217;t take much time for me to finish that book.\u00a0<em>The Fault in Our Stars,\u00a0</em>beautifully written, light-read and fast-paced book, by\u00a0<em>John Green</em>. This is my first piece of\u00a0<em>John Green&#8217;s</em> writing and I must say I am impressed by his style and lightness of the book. The book&#8217;s about Hazel Grace Lancaster, and how a book about a cancer sufferer which brings two sufferers close. The other sufferer being Augustus Waters.</p>\n<p>But there is some fault in the characterization. <em>John&#8217;s</em> characters, Hazel Grace and Augustus, sound more like 25 or 30 year old adults then 17 year old teenagers. \u00a0The character of Augustus is more very mature according to his age. But then the wit <em>John</em> has used in his characters is wonderful to read. The sarcasm is outstanding. This made the dialog conversations between the main characters is realistic and fun to read. I could imagine the characters in front of me conversing to each other. It was that clear. Also, the book is for a quodophile(i.e. me). I also feel, <em>John</em> develop these mature characters as the book also targets young adults and which I feel is a very good thing. The young adults could add something new to their vocabularies and learn some small-small morals which this book provides and\u00a0make a good impact on their attitude and personality through their whole life. This effort, of the author, I appreciate.<em><br />\n</em></p>\n<p>There was also one more fault with the book is that in the end it becomes too much emotional. And that aspect I certainly do not like. But hey, I am not the author, <em>John Green</em> is, and he has full rights to write whatever he wants. Also, he being a male writer, wrote the entire book in female teenager&#8217;s point of view. And I feel, he did a good job. Never once, I felt that something was too <em>manly</em>\u00a0about his female characterization.</p>\n<p>One thing is for sure, I &#8216;d like to read him again, and he is certainly one of the best new authors I read this year.</p>\n<p>3.5 out of 5 from me.</p>\n", "post_id": 1657, "location": false, "date": "12-23-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["flash fiction", "Amandeep Mittal Blog", "Namesake", "book review", "author", "Kim", "Unaccustomed earth", "short story", "Fiction", "blog", "Jhumpa Lahiri", "Book", "books", "Rudyard kipling", "Authors", "Reading", "Review"], "text": "<p><strong>KIM BY RUDYARD KIPLING<br />\nTHE NAMESAKE BY JHUMPA LAHIRI<br />\nAN UNACCUSTOMED EARTH BY JHUMPA LAHIRI<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://amandeepmittal.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/savedpicture-2013122404732.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full;\" /></p>\n", "post_id": 1661, "location": false, "date": "12-23-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["literature", "The Namesake", "book review", "author", "Read", "Review", "Fiction", "Jhumpa Lahiri", "Book", "books", "Amandeep Mittal", "Authors", "Reading", "ebooks", "E-book"], "text": "<p><em><img class=\"alignright\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/img5a.flixcart.com/image/book/9/1/8/the-namesake-400x400-imadbkzf3pd2bgzn.jpeg\" width=\"183\" height=\"280\" />The Namesake,\u00a0</em>was on top of my Christmas holidays book-shopping. I have been waiting for a long time to read it. I haven&#8217;t read much of the South Asian origin&#8217;s authors, but I certainly did enjoy\u00a0<em>Jhumpa Lahiri.\u00a0</em>Her command of the language is amazing. The fluency of her writing clearly shows how effortlessly she must have wrote the book.

Simultaneously experiencing two cultures is not always easy, and this is the main theme of this book.</p>\n<p><em>The Namesake</em> is titled because Gogol is named after a Russian writer\u00a0<em>Nikolai Gogol.\u00a0</em>Gogol, though a famous namsake, lives his early life disliking it. I felt that this conflict was the main necessary of developing of relations between the characters and furthermore, Gogol and his negligence of his own home. The culture exploration is defined uniquely in the book and that was also a part which enthralled me.</p>\n<p><em>Lahiri,\u00a0</em>a <em>Pulitzer prize</em>\u00a0winner, for her short-story collection <em>Interpreter of Maladies,\u00a0</em>has a magical talent for scribbling.

I am no\u00a0<em>time lord.\u00a0</em>But I am happy also, as I could read 28 more books than the last year. So somehow, it is an achievement for me too.

And I got to realize the fact a lot more this year when I took my writing seriously, I was kind of fortunate to my reading habit. <em>Oscar Wilde</em> once said, <em>&#8220;There are only good books and bad books&#8221;,</em>\u00a0and I&#8217;d like to add something to this wonderful and truthful saying, &#8216;It&#8217;s essential to read a book, and then only you can judge if it is good or bad. It is also essential to judge a book good or bad to develop a strong ability of understanding and expressing your judgment. With knowing the difference between good or bad only, you cannot decide (especially if you&#8217;re a writer) what is good or what is bad&#8217;. I do read some badly written books. Some of them do have good plot and structure, but then they lack something here and there. Few of them, I dislike, because the unorganized plot. But the good books, well they are good, plot development is one reason or characterization development is good, et cetera.

I am much obliged to a lot of things this year that I am not going to waste the precious time listing them. But most precious things to me are books. And yes, each and every I try to read more and more, and I try to learn and explore new things through them. And till now I have been successful. It is fun that this year that I set a target of reading 100 books but could not achieve it, still I manage to read 78 of them. I am also hoping to overcome this number next year with reading more and more.</p>\n<p>I also learnt a lot in the art of buying books. Yes, buying books is an art. And to perform that art, you have to buy books. I read more than 50 % of books I read in e-book format. But reading in paperback has its own pleasure. The aroma of those yellow pages when reaches those two nostrils is stronger and beautiful than a the fresh morning and hits harder than the smoke.</p>\n<p>For next year, my intentions are to read more than 78 books, read at least 20 new authors I haven&#8217;t read once and yes write more and more. First thing when the next year starts, I am going to set a target on Goodreads.</p>\n<p>Thank you all fellow bloggers and friends for appreciating me and motivating me to write more and more, for spending your time on reading my words, I wish you guys a Happy New 2014!</p>\n", "post_id": 1683, "location": false, "date": "12-31-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Non-Fiction", "Women", "literature", "flash fiction", "book review", "Hank Chinasky", "Read", "Review", "ebook", "Fiction", "blog", "fantasy", "Book", "books", "author", "crime fiction", "Authors", "Charles Bukowski", "Amandeep Mittal", "E-book", "ebooks"], "text": "<div style=\"width: 325px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1325028693l/38500.jpg\" width=\"315\" height=\"475\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">WOMEN BY CHARLES BUKOWSKI</p></div>\n", "post_id": 1713, "location": false, "date": "01-03-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["fifa", "Non-Fiction", "Soccernomics", "Review", "Book", "Reading", "ebooks", "world cup", "book review", "author", "bundesliga", "Stefan", "Authors", "soccer", "Szymanski", "english premier league", "manchester united", "ebook", "football", "Simon Kuper", "la liga", "books", "Amandeep Mittal", "ac milan", "E-book"], "text": "<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>Soccernomics</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">by</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em>Simon Kuper &amp; Stefan Szymanski</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><img class=\"alignright\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/i4.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article882169.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/Soccernomics%2520book%2520purchased%2520by%2520Roberto%2520Di%2520Matteo-882169\" width=\"258\" height=\"389\" />Anything interesting to read comes in the market about football(or soccer) and being a football fan, it&#8217;s like a love at first sight.\u00a0<em>Soccernomics\u00a0</em>is the first book that tries to data-mine most of the haughty topics in football. Two authors tries to pair football and statistics and seem very fond of proving themselves by applying some methods which in the end might turn out (or in some case did turn out) right. Majority of the book focuses on big events like FIFA World Cup and European Football Championship.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The book is framed chapter by chapter in the form of multiple questions. The authors then to answer these questions,\u00a0use game results, demographic studies, attendance statistics, and other statistical stuff to prove their predictions and shows the fans of football a new way to think about the world&#8217;s most &#8216;beautiful game&#8217;. Though some fans might not agree with the book and still like to believe in that anything can happen in the game, still it&#8217;s good to read the book. Football is a game of numbers after-all, the history, the number of trophies, the money, the fans, the attendance of the stadium everything is in the form of a number.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\">The authors discuss why England, the creator of soccer,\u00a0</span>isn&#8217;t<span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\">\u00a0dominating the field. They illustrate penalty kicks as a psychological treasure trove for the study of game theory. Then they explain about where the word SOCCER comes from, about how relocating a player from one country to another can affect his career. There\u2019s a chapter that discusses how hosting a large sporting event, such as the 2016 Olympics, can be economically damaging to a country but a boon to the happiness of its inhabitants. They also explain how can why the US, Japan, Turkey, Australia, and Iraq can become the kings of the world&#8217;s most popular sport.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I though, do not agree with them over the last point and their ideology of expressing everything in football through statistics.

Especially, a collection of short stories, otherwise if they are properly dramatic and structured, I would read only one or two stories from it. Rarely do I finish a whole book of short stories and this time I did. <strong><i>Unaccustomed Earth by Jhumpa Lahiri </i></strong>is the collection of eight stories which proves that she indeed is a better writer than the other Indian Authors I have read in my lifetime. She understands the experience she wants a reader to enjoy while reading her words. Her writing style is very natural and effortless and the way she care about each and every character she makes is one thing to be learn from her writing. A reader without much effort can indulge him/her-self into the imaginary world she weaves with her words and the experience in that <i>neverland </i>will be unforgettable.</p>\n<p>My favorite story from the book is <i>Year\u2019s End </i>which in itself is a part of trilogy of three short stories. You can also say they make a novella. But that\u2019s not for me to decide. <i>Year\u2019s End </i>is a first person narrative and the second part in the trio. All three stories revolve around two characters: Hema and Kaushik. The essence of this particular story, <i>Year\u2019s End</i>, The emotional touch <i>Lahiri </i>has given in the story. On reading, some might find the story a bit too emotional but I say that a bit too emotions are necessary to continue the story forward, thus a big part of the plot. It is good to read emotional stories sometimes, only if they are properly written as <i>Lahiri</i> has done. This story in which Kaushik tells his part of the story. The way he and his father&#8217;s awkward relationship is portrayed \u00a0as after one incident is the way of showing how can vulnerable and sensitive is human life.

And Certainly John Rebus is the &#8220;Sherlock Holmes&#8221; of modern crime fiction. Or I should say in clear words, certainly the best detective of modern crime fiction. The enigma which surrounds John Rebus is the essence a reader reading Rebus must feel. And Ian Rankin maintains that enigma, that aroma of mysteriousness consistently. He is doing for past 19 books. Not one Rebus I read, and felt discomfort. This is an art and Rankin is the master of this art of consistency in storytelling.</p>\n<p>I was once disappointed and sad when I read Exit Music which was once the last book of the John Rebus. I almost cried as I would not be able to read such excellent stories. But when Standing in Another&#8217;s man Grave came out, I was more jollier than the word jolly can be defined. Recently read, Saints of the Shadow Bible which is the 19th book in the John Rebus series. This book brings back John Rebus in the force, not as DI(Detective Inspector) but as a demoted DS(Detective Sergeant). The story combines several investigations and Rankin also takes the reader back into dark and hollow past of detective John Rebus. He tries to unfold the mysteries originated 30 years back and let us look more into the closet of John Rebus soul. Rebus tries to solve ongoing investigations but his past also haunts him and there some dust of mysteries left in that 30 year old closet which needs to be clean. Thus, with help of DI Siobhan Clarke and Malcolm Fox of the Complaints, the trio investigates in co-operation.</p>\n<p>Characterization Rankin has done is hyper realistic. I have said earlier, he is the master of storytelling. In some other book, another writer might have overdone it but Rankin is just a finesse finisher. It&#8217;s a pity he&#8217;s going on a holiday and won&#8217;t be writing for some time.</p>\n<p>This one is one of those which are hard to keep down in between. I&#8217;ll give it 4 out of 5 for being an avid reader of Rankin&#8217;s books, I could manage to solve few of the mysteries on my own. Otherwise, it&#8217;s a very well written book.</p>\n", "post_id": 1731, "location": false, "date": "01-31-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Adelle Waldman", "book review", "author", "Book", "Review", "Debut Novel", "Fiction", "The New yorker", "fantasy", "books", "Amandeep Mittal", "The Love Affairs of Nathaniel P", "book reviews", "Authors", "The Guardian", "Reading", "E-book"], "text": "<p><img class=\"alignright\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/adellewaldman.com/home_right.png\" width=\"207\" height=\"353\" />Before starting the review, I&#8217;d like to thanks @HTBrunch Magazine for making this review happen through their #BrunchBookChallenge in which you have to read just 24 books to complete the challenge. For making me read a book by an author who knows exactly how to put some relevant words between more words. I met <em>Adelle Waldman&#8217;s</em> highly acclaimed\u00a0<em>The Love Affairs of Nathaniel P.\u00a0</em>a best book of the year 2013 by The New Yorker, The Economist, The Daily Beast, The Guardian (UK) and many more.</p>\n<p>Being a debut novelist and having a strong reading-background, having read Jane Austen, George Eliot, Balzac, and Tolstoy, <em>Waldman</em> through her words has a eerie talent of describing women through a man&#8217;s eyes. When I had started to read the book, I found it quite fascinating on the point that how a woman can describe my subconscious behavior toward women better than myself?</p>\n<p><em>Waldman&#8217;s</em> novel concentrates on the experiences of a young man, Nathaniel Piven or &#8216;Nate&#8217; as he is called, in short. Nathaniel Piven is Harvard drop-out, ambitiously intellectual, well-groomed who writes book reviews and cultural criticism for magazines\u00a0and he\u2019s just sold a book for a six-figure advance. <em>Waldman&#8217;s</em> protagonist is a perfectly honest and socially responsible guy who in her own words, as she tells us at the opening, &#8220;&#8230;\u00a0was a product of a post-feminist, 1980s childhood and politically correct, 1990s college education. He had learned all about male privilege. Moreover he was in possession of a functional and frankly rather clamorous conscience.&#8221; He is particularly sensitive unlike his male friends who are still amused at rating women&#8217;s breasts.\u00a0Although the book\u00a0makes reference to several previous love affairs in Nate\u2019s life, the novel concentrates on one promising relationship with an attractive freelance writer named Hannah.</p>\n<p>The plot is not that hefty but the author&#8217;s illustration of relationship insecurities and tension is quite noteworthy. On reading Nate&#8217;s present and past and present life, one might find him fascinating and I must add that the reality regardless of him being of total screw up, is demonstrated by the author very skilfully.</p>\n<p><em>Waldman</em> has used her skill and crafted an elegant story that is humorous and intelligent, providing a new look to see the reality. The way she portraits the &#8220;love affairs&#8221; of Nate, his Brooklyn life, along with the fact that she is illustrating the behavior of man subconscious toward women needs a lot of skill, and patience in developing the book. I believe <em>Adelle Waldman</em> has both up to the highest level.</p>\n<p>Certainly, I am waiting for her next novel.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d like to recommend this book to someone who wants to read something new, something different in the contemporary world, something which is skillfully written and the best <em>debutante</em> of 2013.</p>\n", "post_id": 1735, "location": false, "date": "02-07-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Non-Fiction", "Review", "Fiction", "fantasy", "Book", "julian barnes", "john green", "Reading", "book review", "Read", "flash fiction", "The weight of the blood", "Authors", "book reviews", "Laura McHugh", "literature", "Reviews", "Levels of life", "E-books", "Paper Town", "Amandeep Mittal", "E-book"], "text": "<p>As being a <strong>READAHOLIC</strong>(and no, I don&#8217;t drink alcohol while reading),today, I am organizing a party with books for books. I&#8217;ve got 3 books to read this month. And I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll be reading more than two of them this month. I have read this month, till now, only two books in comparison to last month in which I read ten books. First, I want to thank\u00a0<a title=\"Net Galley\" href=\"http://netgalley.com\" target=\"_blank\">NetGalley</a>\u00a0and Random House Publications for giving me the opportunity to read\u00a0<em>The Weight of Blood by LAURA McHUGH\u00a0</em>which has an expected publication date on March 11, 2014. I am certain that I will fulfill my job of complete reading it and giving a faithful and honest review back to the publishers. Second, is<em> Paper Towns\u00a0</em>by\u00a0<em>JOHN GREEN</em>\u00a0a very amicable writer but his previous book which I read was an &#8220;okay, okay&#8221;.

I am not hoping to disappoint her by not reading the book, but I cannot guarantee that I will finish the book this month.</p>\n<p>So let&#8217;s see which are two are going to mingle with thoughts?</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1382350324l/18209468.jpg\" width=\"186\" height=\"280\" />\u00a0<img class=\"alignnone\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/johngreenbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/PaperTowns2009_6A.jpg\" width=\"184\" height=\"277\" />\u00a0\u00a0<img class=\"alignnone\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61SXlrTqfLL.gif\" width=\"194\" height=\"275\" /></p>\n", "post_id": 1738, "location": false, "date": "02-08-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["literature", "book review", "The Namesake", "author", "Read", "Unaccustomed earth", "Review", "Authors", "man booker prize", "Fiction", "Jhumpa Lahiri", "Book", "books", "Amandeep Mittal", "The Lowland", "Interpreter of Maladies", "2013", "E-book"], "text": "<p><img class=\"alignright\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1377697673l/18393914.jpg\" width=\"178\" height=\"280\" />After reading <em>The Lowland</em> in two days, not for the reason the book is easy to read. But for Jhumpa Lahiri is a natural-born storyteller. She indeed is. In this book,\u00a0she introduces two brothers, close in age who are poles apart, Udayan, the revolutionary brother who gets caught up in the Mao-inspired Naxalite movement to wipe out poverty in India and his more reserved and dutiful brother, Subhash, who leaves home to pursue an academic and scientific life in Rhode Island. When Udayan inevitably gets swept into a revolutionary movement that turns out badly, Subhash returns home briefly, and picks up the pieces, including an attempt to heal the emotional scars of his brother\u2019s young wife.</p>\n<p>As the plot goes on, Lahiri covers about 70 years of life span in mere 340 pages. The craftsmanship is indeed good but when I was on the last few pages I truly felt that she is a storyteller, but this novel was just average product of her skill of writing. I am not saying it is not readable. The way she started the story, the details of the political conditions and living conditions in 60s of Calcutta(Kolkata, now) to provide a scenario to the reader such that he would feel the connection with story. With her writing, it&#8217;s all about making a reader feel connected with the story, the plot, and the characters are just a phase in-between. Soon they all fade away. This ideology is true with her previous books also which I have read in past two months span, <i>The Namesake\u00a0</i>and\u00a0<em>Unaccustomed Earth.</em> It took me three books to decipher and understand her artistic style of making a reader feel connected towards the story till the end. Many writers do not or they just partially do. At first they do try but as the plot continues to move forward, either they loose the confidence of adjoining the read or they just do not want to. But Lahiri is exceptional. Lahiri knows how to indulge a reader in her book.</p>\n<p>Her third person narration is way to flatter and flirt with the readers. I got flattered. The plot of <em>The Lowland</em>\u00a0is overall very generic and to some it might turn out to be addictive in some way. She is certainly my favorite story tellers of the contemporary world.</p>\n<p>The book was nominated for the Man Booker Prize 2013, and Jhumpa Lahiri has won The Pulitzer Prize for her <em>Interpreter of Maladies\u00a0</em>which is the only book of her left for me to read, till date.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll go for 3.5 of 5.</p>\n", "post_id": 1740, "location": false, "date": "02-11-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["john green", "book review", "author", "Read", "Florida", "Review", "Orlando", "book reviews", "Fiction", "fantasy", "Book", "books", "the fault in our stars", "paper towns", "Authors", "Jefferson Park", "Printz winner", "Reading", "E-book", "Amandeep Mittal"], "text": "<p><em><img class=\"alignright\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/johngreenbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/PaperTowns2009_6A.jpg\" width=\"210\" height=\"316\" />Paper Towns by John Green\u00a0</em>is the second book I&#8217;ve read written by him. The previous,\u00a0<em>Fault in our Stars</em> was unimpressive to me. Though this book impresses me than the previous one in some ways but there is a unacceptable vibe about this book. I&#8217;ll start with <em>John Green</em>, he is a good writer there is no doubt, his skill of writing is a bit ordinary but witty and humorous. The plot and scenes he challenges himself to write are not very realistic but hey, after all this what fiction is. It&#8217;s a lie. So there is no point in arguing over the that fact as many people believe he should write more realistic but being a fictitious writer he can write anything he wants. <em>Harry Potter</em> is not realistic so why should he?</p>\n<p>The plot in general is structural. Quite interesting in the starting. Especially the first part of the book is a high point. It&#8217;s a story which focuses on two teenagers who are to be pass out from their high school.\u00a0Margot Roth Spiegelman an ordinary person, someone you would come across everyday, especially when we were in our high schools we have came across these kind of people, she is beautiful, she is famous in school, has a rich boyfriend, however on the other hand,\u00a0Quentin Jacobsen is also a ordinary boy and very ordinary in comparison to Margo, has best two best buddies, Ben and &#8216;Radar&#8217; who are his comfort zone.\u00a0<em>Paper Towns\u00a0</em>takes place in a subdivision of Orlando, Florida called Jefferson Park. The book is written in first person and narrated by Quentin or &#8216;Q&#8217;. <em>John Green</em>\u00a0seems very fluent in writing as first person.\u00a0Quentin has known Margot since they were young and when they were best friends. He put up with the fact that they weren&#8217;t friends anymore, until Margot decided to drag him into the madness of her midnight revenge. So, Quentin took on a detective&#8217;s perspective to find out why Margot vanished unexpectedly.</p>\n<p>This book certainly made me think about\u00a0how people can react to things differently. It showed how similar yet different everybody is. It surprised me to know that some people take the time to think hard about what&#8217;s going to happen in the future, and worry about it so much that they nearly lose their mind (as I sometime do). It was\u00a0<em>John Green&#8217;s\u00a0</em>writing that kept me reading it till the end. But the plot was very much stretched. Especially, a few chapters in part two and a few from last one. There wasn&#8217;t any necessity though. The book could have ended in just 260 pages instead of 305 pages. That&#8217;s what I felt after reading it.</p>\n<p>The ending will come out as a surprise as it came to me. It is not a terrible ending but not a memorable one also. Though I quite agree with the character&#8217;s feeling towards the end. By the point he stands, is quite genuine and logical. But then again, the book should not have been that long.</p>\n<p>The characterization in the book is imbalanced and not strong. But\u00a0<em> John Green\u00a0</em>should be given credit for commanding the other characters especially, Ben and Radar, dynamically. \u00a0My favorite part from the book is when Quentin struggles in his friendship with his friend Ben and then their mutual friend makes him realize how people are different from each other and we should understand them accordingly. It make me think, we judge a bunch of people by the whole bunch and not individually. I mean why? A bunch of people is not similar to a bunch of grapes.</p>\n<p>This is a good book. But it struggles in between.

I cannot understand, I am tired due to a lot of travelling and still I cannot sleep. Only today I realized that in past three days not only I have read three books, not only more than 700 pages but I am feeling that I want to eat a book a page by page, word by word. That\u2019s right. I don\u2019t know if I am reaching my extreme point of reading books (and then eventually I\u2019ll get tired of reading) or if the reading has seriously become an obsession for me. Sounds to me like my past eight years of reading is finally paying off but the consequences are pretty bad. I am not sleeping. I just cannot sleep. I am craving for reading more books. Everywhere I look, I just see words. <i>Words, words, everywhere and many a words to read. </i>What the hell! It\u2019s 3:39 A.M. in the morning and I have a lecture to attend at 8:30 A.M. before that I have to eat, probably a breakfast which I haven\u2019t had in past two days. I am hungry but this time not for food. Not for the red flesh or a brown piece of bread. When I was reading earlier, my stomach kept growling (and I must tell you, it growls better than many metal-band vocalists), I kept on reading words and more words. For the first time in span of eight years of my reading life, I am not tired of it. It\u2019s something new for me and very indigestible.</p>\n<p>Am I going crazy?</p>\n<p>I certainly have turn into one of those creatures who feel nothing but just wants to go on and on with their obsession. Zombies are close to them. Maybe I have become one. And I am not the ordinary type of zombie I feel, I am a Book-Zombie. I even <em>googled</em>\u00a0the term <i>Book Zombie </i>but what do they know of my type of creatures? All they had were some lists of novels written under the title of zombie. Maybe the term is not perfectly defined. If not, I don\u2019t give a damn. I still have many books left to read. Many battles to conquer, many minds to read, many places to explore, and I am restless to do that. I wish I had more eyes than just two. Such that I could read more than one book simultaneously.</p>\n<p>After reading so many words, I could only produce this much of words.

Very light read, just 107 pages, written for the BBC&#8217;s Quick Read series which &#8220;are designed to be read and enjoyed by avid readers and by people who never had or who have lost the reading habit&#8221;.

From out of the car steps out a friend of Gravy&#8217;s, who&#8217;s got a bag in one hand and a hole in his chest. Unable to grasp the seriousness of the situation, Gravy thinks this is just another visit from his friend. However, when his friend&#8217;s fate is finally met, Gravy feels the need to tell someone.

His right hand man has a little problem of his own. A deal that should have been flawless has gone wrong with one man killed and another taking his flashy BMW. The story-line also unfolds a woman who&#8217;s in trouble for telling the truth. Two detectives struggle to unfold many mysteries. In just 107 pages, <em>Rankin,\u00a0</em>has produced a story-line with a bit of wittiness and a bit of black humor. He has shown how in 107 pages, so many lives can affect due to one incidence which is the most humorous tragedy of life.</p>\n<p>Again, <i>Rankin</i>, is the master of characterization. He does not put much effort in creating them, I guess, but the characters which he creates are unforgettable.

You and I are both writers in that context. But there are times when we feel tortured sitting by a desk with pen (in most cases, a laptop) in one hand scratching our head with the other and a blank page in front of us. Drops of sweat cool us down only for some milliseconds. But have you ever wondered why you cannot write? Of course, we all have. We all have been through that torment phase of inability to write. And we all call that phenomenon, a <i>Writer\u2019s Block</i>.</p>\n<p>Writer\u2019s block is that phase in which we tend to think of ourselves in a number of ways, all bad. We are, as we think, lazy, undisciplined, a shirker, a failure, a cowardly fraud, a good-for-nothing, et cetera, et cetera. Technically, it is a chronic inability to put words on a paper.</p>\n<p>Writer\u2019s block is nothing but an inability to express your creativity. There is also common misconception that writer\u2019s block is a passive condition. But it is not. It is an aggressive reaction. The block is a signal to readapt your way to approach your work. \u00a0Our unconscious self is an ultimate source of creativity. But the resistance act as a barrier which rises involuntarily, a block between the conscious self and the creativity.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignleft\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/favimages.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/franz-kafka-quotes-sayings-non-writing-writer-insanity.jpg\" width=\"360\" height=\"246\" />The nature of creativity is a child\u2019s act in which he indulges his energy wholeheartedly into the manner of creative efforts. Generally, people remember their childhoods as a time when they experienced no resistance in their act of play. The adult writer who want recapture the spirit of creativity has forgotten how to play. But it is not hard to learn again.</p>\n<p>The barrier which we chattered before is not due to lack of willpower. It is due to a stronger emotion: <i>hatred</i>. Hatred to <i>self</i>. Loving oneself is the most difficult task in one\u2019s life to master. To love oneself is essential part of creative process. <i>Writing</i> is a fluid, dynamic process and such is <i>Self-Love</i>. Both acts require positive moral energy. Self-hatred will drive you far away from your unconscious. Being harsh on yourself results in being harsh on your creative self, and it will eventually end up in nothing. \u00a0You must be gentle with your \u201ccreative child\u201d.</p>\n", "post_id": 1775, "location": false, "date": "03-09-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Book", "literature", "book review", "author", "Herman Melville", "Review", "crime fiction", "blog", "fantasy", "Moby dick", "books", "Amandeep Mittal", "Authors", "book reviews", "Vintage publications", "E-book", "ebooks"], "text": "<blockquote><p><strong>CALL ME ISHMAEL</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>MOBY-DICK by Herman Melville</p>\n<p>Might start it by next week, lets read what the fuss is all about!</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone \" alt=\"\" src=\"https://amandeepmittal.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/savedpicture-2014315222857.jpg?w=408&#038;h=544\" width=\"408\" height=\"544\" /></p>\n", "post_id": 1781, "location": false, "date": "03-15-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Ian Rankin", "Non-Fiction", "Review", "Poetry", "Fiction", "fantasy", "Book", "Reading", "libraries", "book review", "author", "Read", "blog", "crime fiction", "book reviews", "literature", "ebook", "peom", "ghost don;t eat potato chips", "books", "Amandeep Mittal", "Authors", "E-book"], "text": "<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://sjhumberstone.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/tumblr_miigahzfhn1qc4q9io1_500_large.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></p>\n<p><em>When I think back on how I became happily addicted to books and reading, I inevitably focus on three things: my mother, my first buy, and then came \u201cthe church of books\u201d: my school\u2019s library.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Mother</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The whole credit of my reading habit (which turned out to be an enormous habit), or the gateway to the heaven of books was unlocked by my beautiful mother when I was a kid. I remember when she used to read to me from time to time and when I grew up, she would sit beside me and make me read and understand a lot of things. I can imagine that purely but titles we read together are vague in my memory. Somewhere I read recently that what we are taught in childhood which when becomes a habit, we don\u2019t think twice before performing that action again.

I remember I was beaming for weeks whenever I looked at the cover, and the white pages (which now have turned yellow when I last saw it, and yes I still have it somewhere) holding it in my hands, and taking it wherever I went. I was in third standard and I don\u2019t remember reading it wholly.

Suffice it to say, I didn&#8217;t like many of my classmates. When those kids would roam and run, and chatter and make fun, all day, I would sit in the library and read books. The place was heavenly. All started with a compulsory library class scheduled in between other classes twice a week. But then, thanks to those two lovely librarians, I was allowed to come and sit and read whenever and whatever I like. The combination of auburn colored wooden tables and the plastic chairs, all the sections divided alphabetically, the stale smell of yellow pages, and the dust covered hard bounded books which were not even moved from their positions in a decade. I read them. They were my classmates and taught me about love, relationships, marriage, artistic creation, despair, work, racism, sexism, injustice, freedom, and commitment. I could sit there experience what the books describer and I could travel and see so many beautiful things. Books were my refuge, my comfort, and my teachers.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/images2.fanpop.com/images/photos/4000000/I-Love-Libraries-books-to-read-4022980-1088-752.jpg\" width=\"314\" height=\"217\" /></p>\n", "post_id": 1787, "location": false, "date": "03-15-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["crime fiction", "Philosophizing", "literature", "author", "Read", "Notes from the underground", "Review", "philosophy", "fyodor dostoyevsky", "Fiction", "classics", "Book", "books", "Amandeep Mittal", "Authors", "book reviews", "Reading", "E-book"], "text": "<p><strong>Notes From the Underground by Fyodor Dostoyevsky</strong></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone \" alt=\"\" src=\"https://amandeepmittal.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/savedpicture-2014316195549.jpg?w=408&#038;h=545\" width=\"408\" height=\"545\" /></p>\n", "post_id": 1790, "location": false, "date": "03-16-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["What are you reading", "literature", "book review", "Monday", "author", "Read", "postaday", "flash fiction", "crime fiction", "Fiction", "fantasy", "Book", "books", "Amandeep Mittal", "Oscar Wilde", "Authors", "book reviews", "De Profundis", "Reading", "E-book"], "text": "<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://amandeepmittal.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/cd1f2-itsmonday.png?w=518&#038;h=130\" width=\"518\" height=\"130\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><i><b>De Profundis</b></i>\u00a0is an\u00a0epistle\u00a0written by\u00a0Oscar Wilde\u00a0during his imprisonment in\u00a0Reading Gaol, to\u00a0Lord Alfred Douglas.

It might not be as popular as <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> but it is worth reading. Whether you are a fan of Jane Austen (and no, you do not need a women\u2019s body to like and read Jane Austen\u2019s books) or not, you should read this one. It will be a good start to become one and explore Austen\u2019s writing.</p>\n<p>When I read it, few years back, I was astounded how different this book is from her other works, especially <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>, and <i>Emma</i>. Fanny Price, the main character, her timidity and morality, quite different from the heroines of the other two. They were smart and sensible, but Fanny Price is different. Also, the plot of this book is quite different from what Jane Austen regularly wrote.</p>\n<p>The precise book and the character have both receive criticism at a higher rate but that makes me wonder why? In my belief, the character of Fanny Price and the book <i>Mansfield Park</i>, both are very close to reality in comparison to the other two books written by Jane Austen. Fanny\u2019s character is based on realism and on first read she might look too na\u00efve but she is a women of deep convictions. \u00a0Some people also say that the character of Fanny is nothing but a sympathetic figure but they also forget about her situation which is tough and how she is never allowed to forget about what an object of charity she is and make her feel from time to time that she is unequal with the people she has been living. The other characterizations, including of Henry Crawford, throughout the book is simple and enjoyable.</p>\n<p>The book truly is written by a different Jane Austen as her other books which I find more of the same and the protagonists when compared will have a bit of similarities.

I was interested in reading a story about another culture and world view that was so outside of my own. In the long run though I felt like the story didn&#8217;t really go anywhere.</p>\n<p><i>Dubravka Ugre\u0161i\u0107</i>, a literary scholar and a writer, tries to capture dolorous outcome of people trying to make a living in an alien surrounding, and her main character, Tanja Lucic, shows a similarity with the author of sharing an ideology of anti-war. Tanja\u2019s class is filled with other Yugoslav exiles, not much younger than she, who have found temporary refuge in the Department of Slavonic Languages. Rather than to teach literature, Tanja nudges the students to reconstruct their pasts by writing essays that indulge their &#8220;Yugonostalgia&#8221; and their memories of Yugoslavia&#8217;s culture and disintegration in war.</p>\n<p>As the plot which seems real, paces slowly, and it weakens. Though the author has honestly tries to capture the reality through her characters and as her words flow, the book becomes a bit \u00a0boring with the lack of pace. I am not judging it to be a true story though it is very closely related to reality, but if it\u2019s a fiction, as mentioned it in the book , it should not lack the characteristics of a fiction. Neither has it the characteristics of a non-fiction.</p>\n<p>But I am not saying that you must not read the book. It\u2019s up to you. To explore something new, to feel a different emotion, to understand the consequences of war and dividing people according to their ethnicity which are not shown on a television or written in a newspaper due to the work of bad human instances, you should grab it.

However for a series that started off as splendidly as this, it\u2019s still a let down from the first two novels.</p>\n<p>The fourth novel in the Clifton Chronicles series picks up minutes where the <em>Best Kept Secret </em>left. This is regular <em>Jeffrey Archer</em> book, no doubt <em>Archer</em> is a wonder story teller but this story (particularly the last two books in this series) is not <em>Archer\u2019s</em> best books. It looks very ordinary on reading as it is advancing. Still, I am very eager to know what will be the final outcome of the Clifton Saga.</p>\n<p>The book opens with Harry Clifton and his wife Emma rushing to hospital to learn the fate of their son Sebastian, who has been involved in a fatal car accident. The fate is not angelic with Cliftons when the chairman of Barrington Shipping Company decides to resign from his post and Emma Clifton wants to replace him. Don Pedro Martinez, not a master villain I would say, just an ordinary but intense part of the story, intends to install his puppet, the egregious Major Alex Fisher, in order to destroy the Barrington family firm just as the company plans to build its new luxury liner. In London, Harry and Emma\u2019s adopted daughter wins a scholarship to the Slade Academy of Art where she falls in love with a fellow student, who asks her to marry him. Both families are delighted until Priscilla Bingham, Jessica\u2019s future mother-in-law, has a visit from an old friend, Lady Virginia Fenwick, who drops her particular brand of poison into the wedding goblet.</p>\n<p>While the Clifton and Barrington families march forward into the sixties, in this tale of love, revenge, ambition and betrayal, the ending leaves the reader in a tight situation. A major event does take place this time which I guess is the biggest event in the Clifton Chronicles, though it is predictable before the end of the book but curiosity craves for what happens after it.</p>\n<p>The wait for the fifth book is too long as it won\u2019t be available for the readers before March, 2015. If anyone new starts this story, I would recommend him to read from the first book, <em>Only time Will tell</em>, which till date stands out to be the best book in this series. Reading the story from between will look dull and boring as later books, including this one, is not excellently (or in Archer\u2019s way) written and plotted.</p>\n<p>3 out of 5 from me.</p>\n", "post_id": 1811, "location": false, "date": "04-08-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["and then there were none", "author", "book review", "Classic", "ebook", "Fiction", "agatha christie", "Book", "books", "Amandeep Mittal", "crime fiction", "book reviews", "Authors", "E-book"], "text": "<p><img class=\"alignright\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/xmedia.ex.ac.uk/wp/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/AND_THEN_THERE_WERE_NONE_APB_jpg_235x600_q95.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"158\" height=\"257\" />I have\u00a0never been\u00a0on good terms when reading <em>Agatha Christie</em>. She made me bore and I confess guiltily (it\u2019s not my habit generally) I have left her two books previously in between while reading. But few years back, a wise man recommended her to me, told me to read her books, stick to them. And this time I did.</p>\n<p><strong><em>And There Were None</em> by <em>Agatha Christie</em></strong>, another recommendation by a special friend whom I\u2019ll thank personally, wanted me to read this one. I read <em>And There Were None</em> in few hours (only two breaks in between) and it was hard to put down. A complete thrilling and terrifying experience which made me go mad and fall in love with it. After a long time I did feel such thrill and adrenaline rush through my body.\u00a0 Had read so much crime fiction in the past, I could not conclude the final outcome which was absolutely brilliant.</p>\n<p>It is the story of ten individuals who are invited to an isolated house on Soldier Island, Devon, England. During their first dinner together, a recorded message accuses each of them of a terrible crime. One by one, they begin to die. One of guests must be the killer, but who is it? The plot of<em> And Then There Were None</em> is so simple yet it is extremely difficult to execute.</p>\n<p>The characters are so adequate and well-crafted and the pace is extremely good, not too fast nor too slow. I quite liked the way author portrays the effect the murders have on the characters, specifically once they realize that no help is coming. Although not everybody\u2019s reaction is described in great detail, a general feeling of fear is successful. There isn\u2019t much in the book but I am sure the plot will give you a chill afterwards when you have read it. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time that I was reading it. A total crazy classical murder mystery.</p>\n<p>This book was a great way for me to spend my weekend while in bed due cold. Agatha Christie does it brilliantly and the book deserves lot of praise.

I was going through her bio the other day and then I learnt\u00a0about this book. Seems like it was quite famous and still might be, 22 years though, since it came out and as the sub-header describes the book, <em>&#8220;The Best BDSM &amp; Fetish Photo-art of 20th Century&#8221;</em>. The book is a collection of photographs rather than a poor form of literary as\u00a0many people criticize on the basis of literariness. So if you do not want to read it, don&#8217;t. Because after reading, it might end up on your coffee table eve though you do not like it. It&#8217;s the essence of this\u00a0book. Just a collection of erotic\u00a0photographs. Few\u00a0of the pictures are offensive and I have no explanation to why these photos are out in public? But I am not the author. It&#8217;s the superstar <em>Madonna!\u00a0</em>But I do get the feeling that a human being is tend to explore more of his sexual fantasies or I should say, to understand himself and his sexual feelings in a better way some experimentation is necessary. Being creative in a good way is always necessary. This is being creative\u00a0in some way. After all, who wants to be monotonous every minute, every day. I am not saying that everyone should come out with a photo-book of their sexual adventures, but experimentation in-person will\u00a0good for their sexual conscience.</p>\n<p>The book was released in the year I was born.

And I am sure, you&#8217;ll love it! This is my second debutante book this year (after <em>Adelle Waldman&#8217;s Love Affairs of Nathaniel P.</em>) and I am must say, it&#8217;s getting better the more I go for <em>debutantes</em>.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Love Letters to the Dead by Ava Dellaira</strong>\u00a0</em>is an exceptional book. Written in the form of letters which begins\u00a0<span style=\"color:#181818;\">as an assignment for English class, <em>&#8216;Write a letter to a dead person&#8217;,</em>\u00a0Laurel, the narrator,\u00a0chooses Kurt Cobain because her sister, loved him. Soon,\u00a0Laurel has a notebook full of letters to people like Janis Joplin, Amy Winehouse, Amelia Earhart, Heath Ledger, and more; though she never gives a single one of them as an assignment to her teacher. She writes about starting high school, navigating new friendships, falling in love for the first time, learning to live with her splintering family. And, finally, about the abuse she suffered while her sister\u00a0was supposed to be looking out for her. I do enjoy books which are written in the form of letters or as journals, it makes me feel that I have some kind of connection with the book.</span></p>\n<p>When I started reading it, it didn&#8217;t take me long to realize the a bit of similarity between\u00a0<em>Perks of Being Wallflower</em> and this book. But as I read it more, I felt that it is better written and more expressive than the <em>Perks of Being Wallflower</em>. The plot is well structured,\u00a0t<span style=\"color:#181818;\">he writing- beautiful, almost lyrical at times and the characterization seems\u00a0real at times.\u00a0Reading through the narration of\u00a0Laurel made me realized a lot of things which are simple yet a thought should be given\u00a0to them. Death, though a five letter word, can affect a surrounding in a greater aspect and we all know that. The consequences are hard, difficult and can be problematic, deciphering in her own words, <em>&#8220;The art of losing isn&#8217;t hard to master&#8221;</em>, but life goes on. And that&#8217;s what Laurel do. She goes on to live with the truth. There is\u00a0a very nice line about truth in the book. It goes like this: <em>&#8220;Truth is beautiful,\u00a0no matter what that truth is. Even if it\u2019s scary or bad. It is\u00a0beauty simply because it\u2019s true. And truth is bright. Truth\u00a0makes you more you&#8221;.\u00a0</em></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#181818;\">I finished this book in two days, though in between at times I felt that I am\u00a0going offshore with it, and when it starts\u00a0to feel a bit tedious, something drives me back to the book. I don&#8217;t know if it author&#8217;s\u00a0writing or the innocence of the narrator, something drives me back to it everytime when I\u00a0started to flow away from the text. And it did not happen once, it happened on and off, almost through the book, until I reached later chapters of the book. There is no doubt that\u00a0<em>Ava Dellaira</em> has written the book beautifully and\u00a0extraordinarily well and on reading it, a reader can easily feel the time and hard work of the\u00a0author devoted, through her words. The book certainly one of it&#8217;s kind in\u00a0the literature of 21 st Century.</span></p>\n<p><strong>4.5 out of 5 from me!

Married to British Army Officer, one Sunday afternoon Sheila came across a badly beaten young girl in a local park near her home. The girl&#8217;s name was Anna. Anna was being pursued by an angry drunken man with a murderous look in his eyes. Sheila led Anna for the safety. A couple of days later their paths crossed again and Anna told Sheila about the abuse she had suffered at the hands of tormentor, the man who chased her in the park. Sheila, appalled by Anna&#8217;s story, helped her get out of town, but paid the price for interfering. The tormentor focused his attention on Sheila. He wanted revenge in the worst possible way. The story doesn\u2019t ends here. With some more thrill and some more twist the plot advances. Sheila, the protagonist, see things. Some dark shadows, maybe it\u2019s a ghost or it\u2019s just her imagination.</p>\n<p>I am quite fascinated by the author\u2019s knowledge of football (<em>soccer</em>). <em>And I wonder as the Word Cup 2014 is arriving, will she\u2019d still supporting Italy?</em> The author has given proper space to each and every character in the book. It\u2019s a hard thing to do, many great writers fail. But <em>Sandra</em>, does not. She goes on creating characters boldly and beautifully. I quite enjoyed the supernatural aspect of the story. It\u2019s not normal for me to do that. Paranormal-fiction, is my least concern and least favorable genre to read, but the amount of paranormal aspect in this book is used, and the way it weaves it\u2019s on web is a major positive part of the book.</p>\n<p>The book starts with a good, comfortable pace but in between something happens to the pace, and I think the coordination of the plot and the first person narrative try to collapse. This also result in the lack of thrill and in the lack suspense which are very essential for the particular kind of genre. The good side of the first person narrative in this book that it is a wise use to get familiar with the character and its surroundings, which in-fact help the reader to develop a bond with the character.</p>\n<p>Being a <strong>self-published</strong> novel, I was quite surprised as I did not find any grammatical mistake or a spelling mistake. And it is also professionally edited. The book has got some good potential to have a readership, and I can guarantee a potential reader if he or she picks this up, they won\u2019t be disappointed.</p>\n<p>I am eagerly waiting for next one. Her hard work did pay off with this one, but I know next one would be better.</p>\n<p><strong>3.5 out of 5 form me!</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Y<strong>ou can visit Sandra Thompson at</strong>: </em><a href=\"http://www.wordsfrombeyond.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.wordsfrombeyond.com</a></p>\n<p><strong><em>Do check out her blog: </em></strong><a href=\"http://www.wordsfrombeyond.wordpress.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.wordsfrombeyond.wordpress.com</a></p>\n<p><strong>Buy this Book:\u00a0</strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Dead-July-Sandra-Thompson-ebook/dp/B00H3RADKU/ref=la_B007QLT34K_1_1_title_0_main?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1395503612&amp;sr=1-1\" target=\"_blank\">Amanzon.com</a></p>\n", "post_id": 1864, "location": false, "date": "04-16-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["young adult", "Read", "Review", "When mr dog bites", "Fiction", "tourette", "Book", "books", "Amandeep Mittal", "Brian Conaghan", "book reviews", "Reading", "bloomsbury", "E-book"], "text": "<p><img class=\"alignright\" src=\"https://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1384569400l/18594504.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"204\" height=\"315\" />I received this\u00a0book as an appreciation gift from <a href=\"http://www.hindustantimes.com/brunch/sid1011.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">HTBrunch </a>magazine for completing their Brunch Book Reading Challenge of reading &#8220;at least&#8221; 24 books this year.

For more you can read my earlier post on <a href=\"http://amandeepmittal.wordpress.com/2014/02/20/brunch-book-challenge/\" target=\"_blank\">BrunchBookChallenge</a>.</p>\n<p><em><strong>When Mr. Dog Bites by Brian Conaghan</strong></em><strong>\u00a0</strong>is a story about a sixteen year old Dylan Mint, who suffers from Tourette&#8217;s.\u00a0<span style=\"color:#181818;\">For Dylan, life is a constant battle to keep the bad stuff in \u2013 the swearing, the tics, the howling dog that escapes whenever he gets stressed. And, as a sixteen-year-old virgin and pupil at Drumhill Special School, getting stressed is something of an occupational hazard.\u00a0</span><span style=\"color:#181818;\">But then a routine visit to the hospital changes everything. Overhearing a hushed conversation between the doctor and his mother, Dylan discovers that he&#8217;s going to die next March.\u00a0</span><span style=\"color:#181818;\">So he grants himself three parting wishes: three <em>\u2018Cool Things To Do Before I Cack It\u2019</em>.\u00a0</span><span style=\"color:#181818;\">It isn&#8217;t a long list, but it is ambitious, and he doesn&#8217;t have much time. But as Dylan sets out to make his wishes come true, he discovers that nothing \u2013 and no-one \u2013 is quite as he had previously supposed.</span></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a fine YA book but with some pretty bad language. That kind of language is not suitable for pre-teens. The\u00a0publishers have taken care of that. They have given\u00a0a warning regarding the explicit content. But overall, the book is an interesting and enjoyable read. Despite the fact, the narrative is what I quite like in it. From the point of view of a sixteen year old, the book is different from the other day-to-day YA books, which is what makes it special. There isn&#8217;t much of the plot or characterization, but the setting is good. No flaw,\u00a0in either characterization or the plot. The pace is good also, satisfactory to the reader as I was able to finish it\u00a0in four hours.\u00a0<span style=\"color:#181818;\">The use of typesetting to convey the effects of Tourettes on Dylan is excellent and makes this an interesting read. In addition, the use of letters in this book work very well to sum up , and they certainly help to show Dylan&#8217;s character development throughout this novel.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#181818;\">The most positive fact that, it is humorous, this book made me laugh out loud on many occasions and\u00a0as the plot advanced,\u00a0I was completely engrossed in\u00a0it. Some of the scenes between Dylan and his mother were quite touching. Good use sentiments. It&#8217;s an easy read, one of those books which have set a different level of first person narration, and for this I appreciate the effort made by the author. If you are in awe of some humor, it&#8217;s a <em>defo</em>.</span></p>\n<p><strong>3.5 out of 5!</strong></p>\n", "post_id": 1872, "location": false, "date": "04-18-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["young adult", "book review", "author", "Authors", "Book", "books", "Amandeep Mittal", "Brian Conaghan", "book reviews", "When mr dog bites"], "text": "<p><img src=\"https://amandeepmittal.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/twt.jpg\" class=\"size-full\" alt=\"BOOK OF THE WEEK: When Mr. Dog Bites\" /></p>\n<p>When Mr. Dog Bites by Brian Conanghan.</p>\n<p> I received this book as a gift for completing my #BrunchBookChallenge (you can check here about BrunchBookChallenge, reading \u2018atleast\u2019 24 books this year) and I am pretty excited to read it. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s about a sixteen year old boy, Dylan Mint, and he\u2019s suffering from Tourette\u2019s syndrome.

The author has totally tried to keep it the historical events as realistic as necessary and not altering a single event for the sake of fiction. Many people have not completely read the book and the major defying\u00a0factor of the book is it&#8217;s pace which is quite slow and does not go well with the story. The plot, what to say about it, it&#8217;s almost perfect but then I would say as compared to the timeline the book covers the plot is quite micro. More than a novel, it&#8217;s kind of a play. The plot advances more with dialogues and less with actions. I quite enjoyed that.\u00a0And as the\u00a0plot advances the reader can certainly notice that the current book is very much essential and the\u00a0plot justifies itself for the next two books in this trilogy. Why it won the\u00a0<em>Man Booker Prize?\u00a0</em>It&#8217;s not for me to decide.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Mantel&#8217;s character are fully realistic, I pictured each and every situation with no difficulty in my imagination when I was reading it. Thomas Cromwell, is of course, both the\u00a0star of the show and her book, she made me met a new Thomas Cromwell, which I was certainly not expecting and I am quite surprised.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em>Wolf Hall\u00a0</em>tells the story of King Henry VIII, his relationship with Anne Boleyn, his divorce from Katherine of Aragorn, and his falling out with the Catholic Church. The tale is\u00a0told from the point of view of Thomas Cromwell who becomes a kind of fixer for the king.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">As I quoted earlier, the book gets better the more I think about it. If you are interested in reading historical fiction, I think you should go for it. And I am sure, you&#8217;ll end up reading the trilogy.

I also used to teach in secondary school so I was used to hearing how teenagers spoke and seeing how the developed.</p>\n<p><strong>The character of Dylan Mint is a bit rowdy in his language. The book has got some good humor and a strong emotional understanding of relationships for the teenagers. With such kind of language, was it not your priority to target teenage readers?</strong></p>\n<p>The \u2018rowdy\u2019 language in the book is wholly justified. That\u2019s the reality of Dylan\u2019s life and the reality of teenage life where he\u2019s from. To cut out the bad language from the text would have been misrepresenting the honesty and integrity of the characters. If people think it\u2019s too much for them to deal with then it\u2019s easy: stop reading and fire the book into a corner.</p>\n<p><strong>How did you find the title: <em>When Mr. Dog Bites</em>?</strong></p>\n<p>I wish I could take credit for it, but sadly I can\u2019t. It was suggested to me from a agent who gad read it. I liked it and used it.</p>\n<p><strong>Your first book, <em>The Boy Who Made it Rain </em>&amp; <em>When Mr. Dog Bites</em>, share similar genre. Do you want to stay in the genre or are you itching to try something different?</strong></p>\n<p>In terms of writing YA fiction I think I shall hang about for a while yet, it\u2019s an enjoyable world to be in. I have written some unpublished adult novels which are very different from the aforementioned.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you read reviews of your own books, online? Like on Goodreads.com?If yes, why?</strong></p>\n<p>I have read a few, some have been sent by my publisher and some have been alerted to me online. I am happy to get a nice review obviously, but with all creative work there will be indifferent reviews. That\u2019s important because it acknowledges the diversity of what people like and don\u2019t like to read.</p>\n<p><strong>What did you bribe yourself with to make yourself write? How do you stay when writing, \u201cdistraction free\u201d?</strong></p>\n<p>I bribe myself with films, football and food. <em>The three Fs</em>. The biggest distraction is the internet, so that\u2019s why I head to the library or the coffee shop when I need to get something done.</p>\n<p><strong>I always believe the taste of music of a character is the taste of his master, <em>the author. </em>You have got good taste Brian. Any favorite bands, singers, musicians?</strong></p>\n<p>Loads. Music is a huge passion of mine and I try to get bands I like into the books. I am a huge fan of <em>The Smiths</em> and<em> Bob</em> <em>Dylan</em>. At the moment I am writing to the sounds of <em>John Murry</em> and <em>Titus Andronicus.</em></p>\n<p><strong>What are you working at the moment? When can we see your next work?</strong></p>\n<p>I have recently completed a novel centering around two friends and what lengths they are willing to go to preserve that friendship. I have also finished a book about one of the characters in When Mr Dog Bites. I think the next book should be out next year, hopefully.</p>\n<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>A WRITING LIFE\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong style=\"font-family:sans-serif;font-size:medium;font-style:normal;\"><a href=\"http://amandeepmittal.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/twt.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-1874\" src=\"https://amandeepmittal.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/twt.jpg?w=196&#038;h=262\" alt=\"twt\" width=\"196\" height=\"262\" /></a>When do you write?</strong><br />\nBetween the hours of 9.30 am and 4.30 pm Monday to Friday</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong style=\"font-family:sans-serif;font-size:medium;font-style:normal;\">Where do you write?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">In my spare bedroom, the local library or the local coffee shop<strong style=\"font-family:sans-serif;font-size:medium;font-style:normal;\">\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-family:sans-serif;font-size:medium;font-style:normal;\">You prefer, Pen or Computer?</strong><br />\nAlways a computer, but I take written notes</p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-family:sans-serif;font-size:medium;font-style:normal;\">Do you have any writing rituals?</strong><br />\nAlways have the perfect music lined up as I write.

Dick</strong>, who is famous for his science fiction works including <em>Minority Report, Blade Runner, Total Recall, Paycheck, Do Androids \u00a0Dream of Electric Sheep?</em> and many more, became my prey. So I picked one of his famous novel\u00a0<strong>Confessions of a Crap Artist\u00a0</strong>which is not a science fiction. My experimentation problem involved to read an author who written books in different genre, and I must say, though I was satisfied when the book got over, but it was not a pleasure to read this particular book.</p>\n<p><strong>Confessions of a Crap Artist</strong> is one of <strong>Philip K. Dick&#8217;s</strong> weirdest and most accomplished novels but I did not find it accomplished. Jack Isidore, the main protagonist, is a <em>&#8216;crap artist&#8217;</em>\u00a0a collector of crackpot ideas (<em>among other things, he believes that the earth is hollow and that sunlight has weight</em>) and worthless objects, a man so grossly unequipped for real life that his sister and brother-in-law feel compelled to rescue him from it. But seen through Jack&#8217;s murderously innocent gaze, Charlie and Juddy Hume prove to be just as sealed off from reality, in thrall to obsessions that are slightly more acceptable than Jack&#8217;s, but a great deal uglier.</p>\n<p>The book starts with a great beginning, the number of characters are\u00a0limited, and the plot mainly revolves around the life of Hume&#8217;s and Jack Isidore, contradicting each other in few ways. As aforesaid, Jack Isidore is considered a dumb, illogical person by his peers but situation turns around and from the Jack Isidore&#8217;s eyes a reader can \u00a0easily see the peers whether in crisis or not share the same level of mentality in some way or the other and are equally dumb and illogical as Jack and they themselves deserve the title of\u00a0<em>crap artist.</em></p>\n<p>The novel flows with a beauty. But halfway through, it becomes\u00a0unbearable and it seems like Philip K. Dick diffuse a bomb, to\u00a0diffuse the beauty of the book. It also feels like Dick is a bit\u00a0out of his element here.

The book is purely statistical and the authors\u00a0are assuming\u00a0that many aspects of the game have reached an equilibrium point\u00a0and will not change for decades.

The book is a Pandora&#8217;s Box of knowledge but the statics used are not sufficient for a reader to apply them in day-to-day <em>football life</em>. Some might diverse into the other direction and thinking the applicability of data in football is limited, but my friends, that is not the case either.

There is a movie adaption of the book <em>(highly recommended to me by a friend)</em> by the same name\u00a0starring Ryan Gosling, Carry Mulligan and few\u00a0more. The movie is an exception, the one you might have never seen before. It proves the statement, <em>&#8220;Silence is so freaking good&#8221;</em> true.

Set mostly in Arizona and L.A., the story is, according to <strong>Sallis</strong>, &#8230;&#8221;about a guy who does stunt driving for movies by day and drives for criminals at night. In classic <em>noir</em> fashion, he is double-crossed and, though before he has never participated in the violence (&#8216;I drive. That&#8217;s all.&#8217;), he goes after the ones who double-crossed and tried to kill him.&#8221; The guy&#8217;s called Driver, he drives on special jobs and one of the few\u00a0attraction a reader will find here is that the character&#8217;s specific name is not mentioned in the entire story. He&#8217;s just a driver. He loves to do that, and he can only do that.</p>\n<p>There are not many characters and since it&#8217;s a novella, the language is in a beautiful flow. Detailed description of the stuffs like food and cars are the other best things this novella has got to tell it&#8217;s readers. The protagonist of this book, though I found him cynical, and fatalistic (which I quite liked), is one of the most conscious character I have ever dealt with in my reading life. With some twist and and &#8216;ninety degree&#8217; turns, the book is a light, short read with a perfect length and perfect timing for the incidents it contains. It has a style of it&#8217;s own and the kind of a style which is very hard to get to be able to read these days. Rapidly satisfying. It is the\u00a0skill that a pro-driver needs while driving a car. The book drives a reader in a similar manner, indulging him\u00a0with in not time. \u00a0<strong>Sallis</strong>\u00a0tried his best \u00a0to keep the soul of\u00a0<em>noir\u00a0</em>fiction through this book.</p>\n<p>You will like this book but I will also suggest that you watch the movie too.</p>\n<p><strong>4 out of 5</strong> from me.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "post_id": 1925, "location": false, "date": "05-17-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Tess of D'ubervilles", "literature", "book review", "Classic", "Read", "Thomas Hardy", "Review", "ebook", "it's monday what are you reading", "sad", "blog", "Book", "books", "Amandeep Mittal", "Authors", "book reviews", "Fiction", "E-book", "ebooks"], "text": "<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://amandeepmittal.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/9902a-its-monday.png?w=592&#038;h=148\" alt=\"\" width=\"592\" height=\"148\" />This Monday certainly came quite fast for me. The weekend got over faster than the light travels. Still I managed to read two books, <strong>Drive</strong> and <strong>Driven</strong> both by <strong>James Sallis </strong>last week. Today I got <strong>\u00a0Tess of D&#8217;Ubervilles </strong>by<strong> Thomas Hardy </strong>from my college&#8217;s library. I have\u00a0this nostalgic feeling of reading something which will fill the void inside for quite a long time now. Yesterday, I even spent an hour\u00a0on\u00a0my laptop browsing the\u00a0collection of eBooks I have but I was unable to decided on a particular title. So I thought it&#8217;d be better to read something in paperback. Also, it feels boring to me on reading on a laptop and that&#8217;s the reason I used my phone as an eBook reader earlier to read but it got broke last week. \u00a0Thus I had to find some other way to get back to my reading, and paperback is the best.</p>\n<p>I hope Mr. Hardy&#8217;s words do me the favor and I&#8217;ll indulge myself into it\u00a0instantaneously.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1358921541l/32261.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"196\" height=\"318\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "post_id": 1931, "location": false, "date": "05-19-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["essential reading", "literature", "5 habits of a efficient reader", "author", "ereader", "read before you sleep", "ebook", "reading is essential", "Bookmate", "Read", "Book", "books", "Amandeep Mittal", "Authors", "book reviews", "kindle", "5 habits of a effective reader", "Reading", "ebooks"], "text": "<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.booksatwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Cassatt.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"476\" height=\"190\" /></p>\n<p>People often say to me, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how you make time to read.&#8221; I admit, it takes a lot of effort to read just one book. Especially, if you are working full time or you have a family, the case is worsen. Luckily I am not indulged in any of them for the time being but being a student I have my own things to keep\u00a0myself busy.\u00a0One thing I tell everyone who ask me the exact question\u00a0aforementioned is, <em>&#8220;If you love books, you find time for them.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Still, people think that I have a\u00a0TARDIS sort of machine and I can travel back in time and read through several books. Well, I wish I had a time traveling machine, but unfortunately, I am no Time Lord. Thus, I thought I&#8217;d share a few tips to be a efficient\u00a0reader even if you\u00a0have a devoting schedule.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>1. READ BEFORE YOU SLEEP</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">This\u00a0is the best and most effective habit of a reader. Reading in a cosy bed\u00a0will give you a comfortable and soothing sleep even if you are not too tired or feeling anxious. I often read 30 to 60 minutes and if I am not tired at all, I might\u00a0end up reading the whole book in a single night if it is good.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>2. TAKE A BREAK FROM THE MASSIVE MEDIA</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Staring your laptop screen for hours, or switching channels on a television for no reason, you need to take a break. It is the first step and most important step of becoming dull. I have done that myself a few times, and I can tell you I regret that. Instead of spending time on watching highlights of a five\u00a0year old football match, or wandering like a forever alone on 9gag.com,\u00a0you could just read a book. It&#8217;ll help you think better, and you&#8217;ll surely feel good.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>3. ACCESS TO BOOKS: BOTH E-READING &amp; P-READING ARE NECESSARY</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">I always try to read two books at a time. One as a paperback and one on my smartphone, an E-book . I&#8217;d advice you to have e -reader, there are many good ones in the market. But if you are like me, and you don&#8217;t want to carry two many things at a time, you can always read a book on your smartphone. There are many good e-reading applications for phones too such as Amazon Kindle, Bookmate (both for Windows Phone &amp; Android). Reading more than one book at a time will keep you interested in one or the other books.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>4. TAKE A BREAK</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">I know, consistent working is the key to success. But it&#8217;s also true, <em>all work and no rest makes Jack a dull boy.\u00a0</em>You should take a break, at least once a month. Stay in your bed and spend some hours on reading while in bed. It feels like one of those heavenly things to do, when I am lazy and reading a book. Sometimes, I read for an hour and then go back to sleep and then read again. It is\u00a0ridiculously beautiful.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>5. GET SOCIAL WITH YOUR READING</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Join a book club. Join Goodreads or Riffle or any other reading social network. Start following some book blogs. Ask\u00a0people around you what they are reading or previously read. Either seeing a book on a website, or hearing about it from a friend will get you more interested in reading a book than picking one for self. Always have a <em>TO-BE-READ (TBR)</em> <em>list</em>. Without one, you cannot go on reading randomly forever. Having a <em>TBR lis</em>t will do wonders. It will motivate you to read more, and at a speed. Don&#8217;t take it as just another work to-do otherwise you&#8217;ll stress out.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em>If you make reading a habit, none of the above will seem hard. By maintaining these habits you\u00a0will surely end up being an efficiently happy reader.</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://amandeepmittal.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/cba5b-ecardinterruptingreading.jpg?w=397&#038;h=278\" alt=\"\" width=\"397\" height=\"278\" /></p>\n", "post_id": 1938, "location": false, "date": "06-01-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["essay", "Non-Fiction", "book review", "people", "Review", "books", "nit kurukshetra", "Fiction", "blog", "fantasy", "Book", "college", "Amandeep Mittal", "Authors", "book reviews", "followers", "tribute", "Reading", "thousand", "1000"], "text": "<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em><a href=\"https://amandeepmittal.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/camera360_2014_5_25_071257.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-1946\" src=\"https://amandeepmittal.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/camera360_2014_5_25_071257.jpg?w=491&#038;h=368\" alt=\"Camera360_2014_5_25_071257\" width=\"491\" height=\"368\" /></a></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em>A thousand Readers, A thousand days, A thousand ways to say!</em></p>\n<p>When I entered the gloomy\u00a0campus of NIT Kurukshetra, I had this feeling that I am going to end up hating this place. So far I have succeed fairly but it&#8217;s not about the campus or the place anymore. I&#8217;m partially grateful actually and thankful too, to have found this place which I can call college. The abandoned looking hostels, but\u00a0when there is a light even in one room, it becomes lively. The food here worsens every year. Right now, I am scared of losing when we come back tomorrow after <em>the last exam</em> and leave this place.</p>\n<p>There are people all around me, abundance of people, who are in this together. Who are on my side, my team. When it&#8217;s four A.M. and no one goes to bed. That night we all can&#8217;t remember. The time we did, we went, we saw, we laughed, we felt. The hats.</p>\n<p>This place is full of circles we pull around ourselves. Clubs, societies, classes. These tiny groups make us feel loved and safe and part of something even on our loneliest night when we stumble in front of our computers, tired, awake. We won&#8217;t have those next year, or the year after. We won&#8217;t live on the same block as our friends. We won&#8217;t have a bunch of pending messages every night.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is scary. More than finding the right job. Few more hours, and we&#8217;ll lose this web we are in.</p>\n<p>Thing is we are all alike. There are things we all wish we&#8217;d done. Nobody wakes up when they want to. Though we fantasize perfectly of our future selves but we&#8217;ll probably never live up to our perfect fantasies. When we came here, there was this sense of possibility, the indefinable potential energy in us, and now it&#8217;s easy to feel like that it has slipped away. We never had to choose and suddenly we have had to. Some of us are focused ones, some of us know exactly what we want and are on the path to get it. To you I say both congratulations, and you suck. For some of us, we are lost in this deep sea, not quite sure what road we&#8217;re on and whether we should have taken it.</p>\n<p>But there is a bright sunshine above that deep sea which makes us remember is that we still can do everything. We can change our minds, we can start over. I remember the first day of my freshman year, sitting in a class,\u00a0looking at a stained glass, imagining that I am here at this place where thousands of people had sat before me. And at that night, awake, I felt so remarkably, unbelievably safe.</p>\n<p><em>We&#8217;re young. We&#8217;re in this together.

They always inspire and motivate me to do new things/keep doing what I am doing towards the betterment of myself and the technology. Biz Stone, in some ways or the other, does motivate a reader, if he&#8217;s a tech-savvy or looking for some motivation to go on with his creativity as he\u00a0offers some great advice about creating ideas, manufacturing opportunity and abandoning the straight and narrow way of thinking. The\u00a0book is filled with interesting stories of Stone&#8217;s life and some of them are quite mind-blowing such as\u00a0\u00a0the joke offer to sell Twitter to Mark Zuckerberg for five-hundred million dollars. How the major event SXSW 2007 turned out to be a new motivation for the Twitter. The plane landing in the Hudson River (I was fascinated by this story, in which Twitter responded faster than the news broadcasting channels and other media.

I just picked this eBook randomly as it was there in my laptop for a long time, beside <em>John Green&#8217;s The Fault in our Stars.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>This is my first Rainbow Rowell&#8217;s book and I have to say, it&#8217;s one of the better <em>YA fiction</em> book I have read. Previously read John Green and Stephenie Meyer I had a completely different experience with it. John Green&#8217;s books (<em>Paper Towns &amp; The Fault in our Stars)\u00a0</em>are fast paced, but somewhere in between they do get boring a few times.\u00a0<em>Eleanor &amp; Park\u00a0</em><i>\u00a0</i>never gets boring. It&#8217;s fast paced, I was able to finish this book in five to six hours and in one go.\u00a0The other reason of it being better than John Green&#8217;s books is that it is more realistic and authentic. I was not prepared of how moving it will be.</p>\n<p>There are two main characters in this book, <em>Eleanor </em>and <em>Park</em>\u00a0and you will end up in loving them both or you just can&#8217;t love anyone. They are like a package.\u00a0If you love one of the character, you have to love the other character.\u00a0Set over the course of one school year, this is the story of two star-crossed sixteen-year-olds\u2014smart enough to know that first love almost never lasts, but brave and desperate enough to try.</p>\n<p>Overall, the book is good. The setting of the plot, the characterization, the writing as I said earlier is\u00a0<em>realistic.\u00a0</em>It&#8217;s not a perfect book though, no book can be. There is a reason for it. They are written by humans and we humans aren&#8217;t much perfect in ourselves. This book gets lazy in the last chapters after racing my heart beat fast and that is least likable or\u00a0the only disliked part from me.</p>\n<p>The story do have some sad part, but I guess that&#8217;s one of it&#8217;s best part. It elaborates what real love is or can be. I am surely going to try her other books.</p>\n<p>Do you even need to be convinced more that you should read it? I don&#8217;t think so.

I had the book in my hand when suddenly a voice from behind suggests me to take the book with me. I glanced back and saw a smiling sweet face, telling me\u00a0again to read the book\u00a0in a polite manner. She was just a reader like me. Picking out books for herself. Previously I thought, there was some jinx in her smile but I guess now, it&#8217;s the book too. I took her suggestion under the consideration\u00a0holding the copy in my hand and bought it home.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em>The God of Small Things</em> is a smart book. Beautifully crafted plot and the author creates a sensation by the language she uses&#8211; witty, sarcastic and coherent at the same time. It never disappoints a reader, if he is indulged in it.\u00a0The story unfolds the lives of people in Kerala who are the captives of Communism, the caste system, and the Keralite Syrian Christian way of life. It embarks on the journey of the dizygotic twins Rahel and Estha, the children of Ammu Ipe.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The book opens with Rahel returning from Calcutta and he reaches Ayemenem during the brooding month of summer. Ammu Ipe who had become desperate to marry after she got rejected during marriage proposals due to her dowry, moves to Kolkata to her aunt where she marries a man who worked in a tea estate. The man soon turned out to be an alcoholic and who used to beat her. After Rahel and Estha were born, she moved back to her house in Ayemenem and lived with her and brother Chacko\u00a0(Rhodes scholar, pickle baron, radical Marxist, bottom-pincher), her blind mother, Mammachi (who plays Handel on her violin), and their enemy, Baby Kochamma (ex-nun and incumbent grandaunt).\u00a0When Chacko&#8217;s English ex-wife brings their daughter for a Christmas visit, the twins learn that Things Can Change in a Day. That lives can twist into new, ugly shapes, even cease forever, beside their river.</p>\n<p>This book shows that how small things in life can affect a person&#8217;s life, narrated brilliantly from the third person point of view the beauty of the book does not ends there. It&#8217;s the plot too which is beautiful. Simple, yet complex which increases due to the certain norms of society such as the caste system. It clearly reveals\u00a0that\u00a0our lives not really being in our hands, that men are social constructs, our lives being governed by the invisible and incoherent energy which surrounds itself like a spider&#8217;s web in a abandoned body. We know there is a cobweb, but we can&#8217;t see the spider.</p>\n<p>The author has drawn an expressive and fluent\u00a0picture of the culture and the people in the\u00a0area. Smells, sights and emotions were vividly portrayed. It&#8217;s her remarkable writing which makes the plot exciting. But some of the characters are so richly portrayed that there was no need of it. It just increased\u00a0length of the book. It also somewhat makes the plot a bit dull in between which I found unacceptable.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em>The book is a Booker Prize winner in 1997.</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>3.5 out of 5 from me!</strong></p>\n", "post_id": 1967, "location": false, "date": "06-11-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Review", "hamlet", "Book", "The Tempest", "The Winter's Tale", "The Taming of the Shrew", "Hogarth Shakespeare project", "The Merchant of Venice", "book review", "author", "blog", "gillian flynn", "crime fiction", "book reviews", "Fiction", "william shakespeare", "Jeanette Winterson", "Authors", "jo nesbo writing macbeth", "othello", "Howard Jacobson", "Anne Tyler", "Margaret Atwood", "Classic", "Macbeth", "books", "Amandeep Mittal", "Jo Nesbo"], "text": "<p><img class=\"alignright\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/theforeigner.no/images/pages/2014/01/15/JoNesb-large.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"158\" height=\"158\" />It&#8217;s a brave challenge for any author.

For books, it&#8217;s new and quite challenging. Whether it will be good or bad, I can&#8217;t tell now for we, the readers, will have to wait for at least twenty four months to see something of the aforesaid.

The chemistry of smart and funny is quite good in this book. There is a movie by\u00a0the same title starring George Clooney, which I saw two wholesome years back, and it was the first time I ever saw Clooney on the screen. But I was\u00a0not fascinated by him. In fact, \u00a0I was fascinated by\u00a0<em>Ryan Bingham&#8217;s (played by Clooney)\u00a0</em>job profile&#8211; the one who can fire other people from their jobs.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>Walter Kirn&#8217;s</strong><em><strong> UP IN THE</strong>\u00a0<strong>AIR</strong></em><strong>\u00a0</strong>is a unique book and one of it&#8217;s kind.\u00a0<strong>Kirn&#8217;s</strong> quite witty with his words and knows how to use them\u00a0and is quite practical about them. The plot is quite simple.\u00a0<em>Ryan Bingham,\u00a0</em>as a consultant constantly flies around the country. He&#8217;s a modern day nomad.\u00a0Although he has come to despise his line of work, he has come to love the culture of what he calls &#8220;Airworld&#8221;, finding contentment within pressurized cabins, anonymous hotel rooms, and a wardrobe of wrinkle-free slacks. With a letter of resignation sitting on his boss&#8217;s desk, and the hope of a job with a mysterious consulting firm, Ryan Bingham is agonizingly close to his ultimate goal, his Holy Grail: one million frequent flier miles. But before he achieves this long-desired freedom, conditions begin to deteriorate.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Though the book do have the OCDish feeling in the main character, the movie is quite clean. The book also lose a reader sometimes, due to not so good characterization, may be because there were too many of them (<em>or may be I am becoming a dull reader *laughs*).\u00a0</em>Throughout the novel I felt like a fellow passenger on one of Ryan\u2019s flights, as he intimately shared his goals, his fears and his realizations which was quite a proficient feeling as it binds a reader with the book but the book itself\u00a0gets a bit confusing in the end and the hold I maintained\u00a0from the start was\u00a0gone.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Still it&#8217;s readable if you are in the right mood or really want to read something different. It looks like a light-read but it&#8217;s not.\u00a0<strong>Walter Kirn\u00a0</strong>does have peculiar style in which he does not only describe a scene to a reader in words but literally tries to show him a fragment of his own imagination.

Rose soon uses her investigative skills to track down the identity of her biological mother.\u00a0Whether she is successful or not, you&#8217;ll have to read it to find out.</p>\n<p>The characterization in this book, goes very well with the plot and the pace the plot moves. Characters of Rose and Lily are almost realistic, very much like a real human being. There is no doubt that <strong>Sandra\u00a0</strong>writing grabs a reader&#8217;s attention\u00a0as fast as thee plot in her\u00a0book moves\u00a0which is why her\u00a0writing is persuasive and flawless. I can&#8217;t wait to see a paperback edition of this book.</p>\n<p>The book is recommended! <strong>4 out of 5</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>I&#8217;m glad, I got this opportunity to receive a copy in exchange of an honest review!

Your mum snagged a fella before you. She told him to put a ring on it and <em>he did</em>.\u00a0Unlike <em>your</em>\u00a0ring finger, which is dry, lonely and vacant. Not to mention, <em>without\u00a0</em>a ring.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpf1/v/t34.0-12/10419866_10152461739467726_151198193_n.jpg?oh=5d5bc19200795a7e86527f7567c95755&amp;oe=53A5807D&amp;__gda__=1403390217_db75ce273eba5b0d39f501f38944dd03\" alt=\"\" width=\"276\" height=\"148\" /></p>\n<p>Engagements, weddings, funerals, get-to-know each other parties, reunions etc are all time consuming, boring meet and greet things. In my experience, they have been anything but delightful. Even the ones who say\u00a0 they are <em>absolutely delighted</em>\u00a0to attend such shenanigans, aren&#8217;t really delighted at all. They are just like you, cursing that they have to get all dolled up for the evening while rummaging\u00a0 through their closet, trying desperately to fit into a dress that fit perfectly two years ago. Which dress is more appropriate? Is this too loud? Should I put my hair up? Such questions haunt all of us the moment we are invited to social gatherings. Here&#8217;s my guide on how to handle being at such &#8220;delightful&#8221; meet and greet, particularly the one where your mum&#8217;s getting engaged:</p>\n<p><strong>Shrug off the embarrassment</strong></p>\n<p>There might me a moment or two (or <em>more</em>) where the reaction to hearing your moms engagement wouldn&#8217;t exactly be what you&#8217;re expecting. Actually, it <em>will</em> be exactly what you&#8217;re expecting: no one would be jumping from excitement at the news of your mun&#8217;s second try at marriage. Friends and family will either stare at you, with eyeballs the size of football, in disbelief or pretend they have misheard you.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://zarinaqvi.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/20140608-172123-62483509.jpg?w=240&#038;h=169\" alt=\"\" width=\"240\" height=\"169\" /></p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>What..wait are YOU getting engaged? Oh your mom! Your mom? Really? At this age</em>&#8220;</p>\n<p>It can be embarrassing but don&#8217;t be. Everyone has a right to choose how to live their lives. It&#8217;s the 21st century <em>for god&#8217;s sake</em>. Now, YOU\u00a0pretend to not hear them at all and continue talking about it with the same enthusiasm as you were before.</p>\n<p><strong>What to wear</strong></p>\n<p>No dress is too short, no color too bold, no heel too high, no makeup too loud if YOU feel confident enough to pull it off. It all depends on you. Be true to your style and to yourself. And even though you&#8217;re at your mothers engagement, you don&#8217;t need to be someone&#8217;s idea of prefect. Chances are you&#8217;ll be the target of some comments, audible and non. Even if others think they can&#8217;t tell you and lady gaga apart, at least you&#8217;re having a ball working it!</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://zarinaqvi.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/20140608-172513-62713498.jpg?w=182&#038;h=272\" alt=\"\" width=\"182\" height=\"272\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Handshake or Hug</strong></p>\n<p>This is a tough one. Obviously, when you meet someone you know very well, you hug and air kiss them, leaving handshakes for the ones you don&#8217;t know or the ones you don&#8217;t want to know.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://zarinaqvi.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/20140608-173032-63032365.jpg?w=203&#038;h=211\" alt=\"\" width=\"203\" height=\"211\" /></p>\n<p>To avoid such awkwardness and create better first impressions I advise you to take their cue. If they seem friendly and cordial, spreads your arms for the hug. But if their hands are tied behind their back and they&#8217;re just nodding hellos, chances are you&#8217;re not getting the love.</p>\n<p><strong>The Two seated Sofa</strong></p>\n<p>Nothing so awkward about the two seated sofa. Nothing awkward if two people are sitting on it. &lt;em&gt;Very&lt;/em&gt; awkward when six people are trying to squeeze their butts onto the now &lt;em&gt;flattened&lt;/em&gt; sofa seats,holding their breaths while the photographer clicks away unless someone begs him to stop.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://zarinaqvi.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/20140608-173447-63287797.jpg?w=286&#038;h=143\" alt=\"\" width=\"286\" height=\"143\" /></p>\n<p><strong>The Awkward Session 2</strong></p>\n<p>When other couples at the place start posing for family portraits in the middle of a photo session held for the newly-engaged. Um hey dude? You got your chance. Don&#8217;t ruin someone else&#8217;s photo session because you missed yours.</p>\n<p><strong>Small Talk<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>We all hate it but you can&#8217;t get through these evenings sitting in a corner, munching on snacks. Chances are you&#8217;ll meet someone interesting. Even more are the chances that someone will find <em>you</em>\u00a0interesting and start a conversation when you&#8217;re mouth is full of food and you have bread crumbs on your pretty little dress. Avoid controversial topics (<em>oh, so you think being gay is OKAY? Don&#8217;t you know it&#8217;s a CHOICE?</em>) and subjects that might trigger confrontation (<em>so why exactly do your dad leave your mom?</em>). Keep it nice and light. Focus the attention on <em>them</em>. It will be exhausting to hear some self obsessed girl talk about herself and you&#8217;ll tune out every now and then, but look at it this way: <em>the less you talk, the more you listen</em>. The more you listen, lesser are the chances of you ending up with your foot in the mouth.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://zarinaqvi.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/20140608-174820-64100347.jpg?w=228&#038;h=173\" alt=\"\" width=\"228\" height=\"173\" /></p>\n<p><strong>That Annoying Kid</strong></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://zarinaqvi.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/20140608-174924-64164051.jpg?w=151&#038;h=199\" alt=\"\" width=\"151\" height=\"199\" /></p>\n<p>There will always be that one kid who will look like an angel, but underneath the mop of hair will be two small horns.

Get away from the computer</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em>Go somewhere, where your heart takes you.\u00a0</em>But please leave the desk, you have spent\u00a0all your week in front of that flat bright screen, suffering from a god-knows-what syndrome or wrist cramp due to excessive use of keyboard. Give your hands a rest. Do something else.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>2. Surround yourself with Creative people</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">We all have some friends, who are creative. Hangout with them. Visit the\u00a0places which inspire you, taking along your creative friend. And if you&#8217;re too lucky, find a creative date.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>3. Finish Something</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">We all have some pending work here and there. Make sure you are able to finish that work before the weekend ends. I am sure, it will make you feel good and afresh.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>4. Get lots of Rest</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Okay, by that, I do not mean that you spend your whole weekend while sleeping. But yes, sleeping till late in the mornings, and having <em>brunch\u00a0</em>in bed is acceptable.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>5. Read a Book</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Pick a book. Go somewhere with it. There are lots of cafe&#8217;s and other places nowadays where one can sit and read in peace.

Frodo\u2019s parents had died in a boating accident when he was small.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This year the party promises to be even grander than ever before, becoming the talk of Hobbiton. Most people admire Bilbo, but some think that it is unnatural for a person to have inexhaustible wealth as well as a prolonged life. Still, Bilbo\u2019s parties are legendary and everyone has been invited</p>\n<p>There are presents for everyone; the fireworks have been specially designed for Bilbo by Gandalf\u00a0the wizard. There is a splendid supper for everyone, and a special dinner for a small group of special friends and relatives.</p>\n<p>After the dinner Bilbo announces that he has three reasons for the grand party. First he cares for everyone present. Second, he wants to celebrate the birthdays of himself and his heir. Third, he wants to bid the people of his town farewell. He steps down, puts on his ring of invisibility, and disappears from the crowd.</p>\n<p>He also mention that why there four hundred and forty four guests. As it was his eleventy one years and his heir, Frodo&#8217;s thirty and three years so total of one hundred and forty four. Not to mention that Frodo just came of his age. In the Shire, it was considered that when you enter your twenties and till thirty two you are in your\u00a0<em>tweens.\u00a0</em>(Thirty three was age they considered to be off to adulthood).</p>\n<p>Back at his home, Bilbo talks to Gandalf, the wizard. After much discussion, Gandalf persuades Bilbo to leave the magic ring for his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Frodo. Bilbo had promised to do this, but when the time comes he is reluctant.\u00a0He leaves, much relieved and happier than ever. Gandalf warns Frodo not to use the ring. The following day Frodo is busy as Bilbo had left farewell-presents for many hobbits, and there is now a crowd of people at Bag End, many of them digging around and searching for Bilbo&#8217;s imaginary treasures. Gandalf leaves, and does not return for a long time.</p>\n<p>Tolkien\u2019s world is a magical one populated by elves, goblins, trolls and other mystical beasts. Bilbo has already had many adventures chronicled in a previous book,\u00a0<em>The\u00a0</em><em>Hobbit</em>. The author, depending on the reader\u2019s familiarity with the Middle-earth chronicle that came before, treats Bilbo as a recognizable and likeable character with an established fan base.</p>\n<p>This chapter serves mostly to introduce the second generation of adventures, led by Bilbo\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Frodo. With this chapter presenting a kind of &#8220;changing-of-the-guard&#8221; scene between the two Hobbits, Frodo earns some respect and admiration simply by his association with a past successful hero.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n", "post_id": 203, "location": false, "date": "06-19-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["the fellowship of the ring", "Review", "Poetry", "Writing", "fantasy", "Book", "Epic", "Lord of the rings", "Reading", "book review", "author", "Read", "LOTR", "Authors", "book reviews", "literature", "Fiction", "lotr review", "Classic", "j r r tolkien", "books", "Amandeep Mittal"], "text": "<p><img class=\"alignright\" src=\"https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1295996438l/423092.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"124\" height=\"187\" />I first read\u00a0<em><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">The Fellowship of the Ring by J. R. R. Tolkien</span>,\u00a0</em>the first book in\u00a0<em>The Lord of the Rings Trilogy (though\u00a0originally\u00a0not a trilogy)</em>\u00a0last year in the summer, but left it in between and could not complete it. This year I started it again at the same time, summer, and I am glad I completed it. It&#8217;s epic in its own way.</p>\n<p>Tolkien certainly gets a place\u00a0among top authors irrespective of the era or the century. <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> is one snippet. If you go on exploring his whole <em>middle earth</em>, that&#8217;s one big proof. After reading it, I am quite impressed by the depth of the book especially the part of Tom Bombadil, which was not in the movies, and\u00a0the reason to leave is totally understandable. The poetry/prose and the lyrical statements are again the most charming part of reading this book. Tolkien does it so well, that this book which looks so heavy from the outside is simple to read. There are many fascinating poems/prose in this book which now are used in the common dialect among us. Like, <i>&#8220;All that glitter is not gold&#8221; </i>is a poem written by him.\u00a0By writing <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, Tolkien certainly has set a benchmark for fantasy writers and 80-90% of the fantasy books are compared to it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The\u00a0adventure starts in shire, the land of <em>Hobbits</em> with some the flawless characters of Frodo, Biblo, Gandalf, Sam, Merry &amp; Pippin. These characters are created with patience and Tolkien with his words shows each and every aspect of human nature. The Hobbits are almost like\u00a0humans in many ways, though only with shorter feet. The loyalty of Sam for Frodo is one example. The friendship of Merry, Pippin ad Frodo is another. Frodo knows the Ringwraiths are\u00a0searching for him &#8211; and the Ring of Power he bear\u00a0that will\u00a0enable Sauron to destroy all that was good in Middle-earth. Now it was up to Frodo and his faithful servant Sam to carry the Ring to where it can\u00a0be destroyed &#8211; in the very center of Sauron&#8217;s dark kingdom. The adventure is all about to reach there and destroy the ring.</p>\n<p>I admit, it has it own flaws.\u00a0There are few spots where the story drags, such as the many pages where he describes the characters marching endless miles through forests or swamps or mountains without much happening. Though the characterization is not so perfect either. There are some characters who are not developed enough. But these flaws are acceptable and can be ignored\u00a0if you are reading\u00a0<em>The Lord of the Rings.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>I still have to read the other two books left in this trilogy, and I am not judging other things before reading them.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t think I have to say this, <em>&#8220;it is recommended&#8221;,\u00a0</em>you know that already.\u00a0<strong>4.5 out of 5!</strong></p>\n", "post_id": 2032, "location": false, "date": "06-25-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["emily schultz", "stephen king", "joyland", "book review", "author", "Review", "crime fiction", "Fiction", "blog", "Book", "books", "Amandeep Mittal", "Authors", "book reviews", "stephen king money", "Writing"], "text": "<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1390434267l/1134600.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"132\" height=\"194\" /></p>\n<p>A Canadian author, Emily Schultz\u2019s debut novel published in 2006\u00a0is called <em>Joyland</em>, similarly\u00a0Stephen King who is believed to be a literary, the author of fifty plus novels in the past thirty years, published a novel called\u00a0<em>Joyland </em>last year, 2013.

It&#8217;s a short one day read, light and very easy language. It&#8217;s not the language which inspired me\u00a0when I\u00a0read this book, it&#8217;s the simplicity which <em>Murakami</em> uses in his writing. Not at all complex. A serious stress reliever and philosophical.</p>\n<p><em>Hear the Wind Sing</em>\u00a0has a nameless narrator, quirky realistic characters, off-the-wall dialogue, lots of beer and cigarettes, some music and some literature. His characters are the last people one would expect to break into an emotional monologue. And yet <em>Murakami</em> brings out the sense of sadness and loneliness that lurks beneath the nonchalant exterior very well. Where this sadness emanates from, they know not. Just like us, sometimes we are sad without a reason and in that situation we do try to find a reason like a lost wanderer. Basically, this novel as a whole is a story without the plot, where the timeline is moving in non-linear sense and the narrator is talking to readers in any way he wants to. Sometimes he talks about writing and the problem of writing, or about his fascination to Derek Hartfield (a fictional author that <em>Murakami</em> creates), or about the girl with one finger missing, or his good friend the Rat,\u00a0son of a wealthy family, adrift in the confusing sea of late-60&#8217;s and early 70&#8217;s Japan.</p>\n<p>When I read it, I felt that I am\u00a0observing some real human beings \u00a0as puppets in front of my eyes through his words. The way he describes little and ordinary things is the best thing about his writing which I like. There was an instance where he described summer rain and\u00a0I could really visualize and feel along with the text because of its simplicity. As I said earlier, it&#8217;s entirely philosophical and best read in my opinion for the people who are in their early twenties. The text and some quotes left me thinking for hours. I am fascinated by how simple the book is with not much of the plot, and yet I like it. It&#8217;s certainly an artistic novel.\u00a0<em>Murakami\u00a0</em>has earned one more fan due to his writing. I cannot wait to read his other books in this series which is called\u00a0<em>The Rat Chronicles.\u00a0</em>There are four books in total, and this being the first.</p>\n<p><strong>3.5 out of 5!</strong></p>\n", "post_id": 2044, "location": false, "date": "07-02-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["rat chronicles", "Reading", "book review", "author", "1973", "Haruki Murkami", "Hear the wind sing", "Writing", "blog", "Pinball", "Book", "books", "Amandeep Mittal", "Authors", "book reviews", "Fiction", "Review", "ebooks"], "text": "<p><em><img class=\"alignright\" src=\"https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1279373805l/591978.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"128\" height=\"180\" />Pinball, 1973 by Haruki Murakami\u00a0</em>is the second book the Rat Chronicles. This is the second book which was published written by Haruki Murakami. This book is more penetrating than the previous\u00a0<em>Hear the Wind Sing\u00a0</em>in a few ways including the plot. It has a similar plot to the last book, but this time the author\u00a0does add\u00a0some linearity in the plot. The narrator is still nameless. There are\u00a0again a lot of beers and cigarettes. It&#8217;s again a one day read, and yes I did read it in one day. Short, light, stress reliever novella.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s interesting\u00a0the way the stories of the narrator and The Rat are in parallel. Beginning 3 years after the first part we find the narrator out of college, living and working in Tokyo and living with twins. The Rat, having dropped out of school sometime earlier, is still adrift in the seaside town, still drinking beer in J&#8217;s bar, and still alienated from society and himself.The most interesting metaphysical issue that the author\u00a0raises is the significance of entrances and exits. He only talks about this explicitly when he&#8217;s naming the twins, but it seems important throughout the work.\u00a0Both Rat and the narrator share the same love in pinball. But for Rat, it&#8217;s just a game while the narrator feel something special about this pinball machine. In the end, the author\u00a0did a good job of exploring the issue of transference in this short piece, with regard to the narrator&#8217;s girlfriend and the pinball machine.</p>\n<p>Again the characters are quirky and bonded with plot in such a manner that a\u00a0reader cannot find a flaw in that. With his short and simple way of writing, <em>Murakami</em> certainly made clear that <em>&#8220;Simplicity Rules&#8221;</em>. It&#8217;s again a stress reliever, after reading it, one will feel himself slightly above the ground and in the air. This book is a perfect fora beach read, or a perfect read on a rainy day for each\u00a0raindrop reflects every word the text contains. This book clearly shows author&#8217;s\u00a0development as a writer.\u00a0I enjoyed the story-telling and writing style of <em>Murakami</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>4 out of 5!</strong></p>\n", "post_id": 2048, "location": false, "date": "07-05-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Steal Like an Artist", "Non-Fiction", "literature", "book review", "Entertainment", "Review", "author", "Creative", "blog", "Austin Kleon", "Book", "books", "Amandeep Mittal", "Authors", "book reviews", "Reading", "Steal", "Writing"], "text": "<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em>This book has got enough to instigate you to start &#8216;doing&#8217; your work.</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><em><img class=\"alignright\" src=\"https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1388177651l/13099738.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"116\" height=\"116\" />Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative by Austin Kleon</em></span> is slim, short, novella, which can be read over a little more than an hour.

His last book I read, was <a href=\"http://amandeepmittal.wordpress.com/2013/09/19/book-review-mistress-by-james-patterson-david-ellis/\" target=\"_blank\">Mistress</a> which was mediocre. I gave my reasons and one of them being\u00a0that James Patterson books are well written when they are not co-authored. And this book,\u00a0<em>I, Alex Cross</em> proves that statement right.</p>\n<p><em>I, Alex Cross\u00a0</em>is a fast read thriller though being 400 pages, can be read in a day. And the fineness\u00a0of Alex Cross&#8217;s narrative is what makes it a must read if you want to read anything written by James Patterson. The plot gets better when Alex Cross gets personally involved in a crime scene.\u00a0Pulled out of a family celebration, Detective Alex Cross gets awful news: A beloved relative has been found brutally murdered. Vowing to catch the killer, he quickly learns that she was mixed up in one of Washington, D.C.&#8217;s wildest scenes. And she was not this killer&#8217;s only victim .As Alex closes in on the killer, he discovers evidence that points to the unimaginable &#8211; a revelation that could rock the entire world.</p>\n<p>The development of the plot goes with number of pages. The Chapters are short and interesting. The graphic content in between is good and matches the plot perfectly.\u00a0I really loved the way Patterson has built up the antagonist\u2019s character. He is rich and powerful and will do anything from being discovered. It was intriguing to see exactly how far the character would go. I also particularly enjoyed the political involvement in the novel. Though just to fill up the pages there are some parts in the story which are drags, but that has to be compromised. The most important part of the book is the ending which is astonishing. The way the plot is structured, it is quite challenging \u00a0for a reader and for this book it was almost diminutive for to catch the culprit.</p>\n<p>This book is also a good read for any aspiring writer who can easily see and learn through the development of characters, red herrings, the structure of the plot and a few things more. It&#8217;s kind of complete package.</p>\n<p><strong>4 out of 5!

Reading books help us to tolerate and survive the dullness and stress of the week.

Even though paranormal is my least favorite genre and it has been long that I have read one, <em>Madhuri\u2019s</em> writing certainly made me accustomed to it.</p>\n<p>The Sanctum, an all-powerful governing body founded by ten families, entrusted to maintain the peace amongst Magicals and ensure the ignorance of humans, has been corrupted by greed and savagery for generations, but is all Wyatt Clayworth has ever known.</p>\n<p>Dev, the hybrid demon prophesied to bring an end to <em>The Sanctum</em> and destroy the world for Magicals and humans alike, is not what Wyatt expected to find when sent out on his latest mission. Believed to be hunting a killing machine, Wyatt finds little more than a broken girl with haunted eyes and a bit of a death wish. Drawn to one another for reasons they cannot begin to explain to themselves, much less anyone else, Wyatt is determined to protect Dev and help her realize her mission to avenge the deaths of her family at the hands of The Sanctum.</p>\n<p>With the good plot, the characters are thoroughly developed and easily adaptable. The pace is one of my favorite part about this book. It does not make you feel that you are crawling through it to read it. The concept of the book is basically love/hate relationship type that makes it more interesting to read. The alteration of changing POV of characters vigorously was a point I did not like much in this book but I do understand the hard work author has put in it. There some instances in the book\u00a0that\u00a0will certainly leave you on the edge of your seat wanting more and you can\u00a0get more in the next book.</p>\n<p><em>The Girl is the first book in THE SANCTUM Trilogy</em> and <strong>it is recommended.</strong> I cannot wait to read the other two.</p>\n<p><strong>4 out of 5 from me!</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>I\u2019d like to thank the author as I received this book from the author herself, in exchange of the honest feedback.</em></p>\n<p><b><a href=\"https://amandeepmittal.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/mb.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2095\" src=\"https://amandeepmittal.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/mb.jpg?w=137&#038;h=137\" alt=\"MB\" width=\"137\" height=\"137\" /></a></b></p>\n<p><b>About the Author:\u00a0</b>Madhuri is a Jersey City Heights girl via Snellville, Georgia, who writes paranormal fiction and is slightly infatuated with tattoos, four-inch heels, ice cream, Matt Damon, scotch, Doc Martens, Laini Taylor, photo booths and dancing like a fool.</p>\n<p>You can visit her at the\u00a0<a href=\"http://madhuriblaylock.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>.</p>\n", "post_id": 2091, "location": false, "date": "07-13-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Review", "Writing", "Book", "GIveaway", "Reading", "ebooks", "Horn!", "book review", "author", "Kevin Thomas", "Authors", "book reviews", "Renata Adler", "literature", "David Graeber", "ebook", "Fiction", "Thomas", "The Collected Reviews", "books", "Amandeep Mittal", "Julian Assange"], "text": "<p><img class=\"alignright\" src=\"https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1400509848l/22002162.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"151\" height=\"182\" />A book is a collection of words, those words can be numerous and further expressing\u00a0numerous ideas.

However, being obsessed on reading more Gothic Fiction\u00a0and the author herself I decided\u00a0to give it a read and I\u00a0confess that I am sorry I have waited for this long.</p>\n<p>The story behind the writing this great piece of Gothic Fiction is as animate as the book itself. In 1816, at Lord Byron&#8217;s villa on shores of Lake Geneva, Lord Byron himself and his guests Percy Shelley, Mary Shelley, and John Polidori.\u00a0Byron, inspired by some fireside readings of supernatural tales, suggested that each member of the party should write a ghost story to pass the time. The incident is well described by the author herself\u00a0in the\u00a0<em>Author&#8217;s Introduction</em> to the book:</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong><em>&#8220;We will each write a ghost story,\u201d said Lord Byron, and his proposition was acceded to. There were four of us. The noble author began a tale, a fragment of which he printed at the end of his poem of Mazeppa. Shelley, more apt to embody ideas and sentiments in the radiance of brilliant imagery and in the music of the most melodious verse that adorns our\u00a0language than to invent the machinery of a story, commenced one founded on the experiences of his early life. Poor Polidori had some terrible idea about a skull-headed lady who was so punished for peeping through a key-hole\u2014what to see I forget:</em></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>They wanted to reanimate a corpse through their words.\u00a0And the outcome was the\u00a0creation of some outstanding works:\u00a0<em>\u00a0Mazeppa by Byron, Vampyre by Polidori and Frankenstein by Mary Shelley.\u00a0</em>She was only nineteen when she wrote\u00a0<em>Frankenstein\u00a0</em>that some claim\u00a0as the beginnings of science fiction and others as a masterpiece of horror and\u00a0ghoulish. But after reading it, I felt, that it is both more and less an important ancestor of the aforementioned labels.</p>\n<p><em>Frankenstein</em>\u00a0tells the story of committed science student Victor Frankenstein. Obsessed with discovering the cause of generation and life and bestowing animation upon lifeless matter, Frankenstein assembles a human being from stolen body parts but; upon bringing it to life, he recoils in horror at the creature&#8217;s hideousness. Tormented by isolation and loneliness, the once-innocent creature turns to evil and unleashes a campaign of murderous revenge against his creator, Frankenstein.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 157px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.hive76.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Mary_Wollstonecraft_Shelley_HF_L_2_105295_201891.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"147\" height=\"178\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Mary Shelley</p></div>\n<p>As the story goes on I felt both for the creator of the monster and the monster itself. The creator stands right in his place in urge to create something the mankind has never seen, exhibiting his power through science \u00a0but ends up corrupting his own destiny. On the other the hand, the so-called monster which by the end of the story, appeared to me more of a miserable\u00a0murderer than of a monster, created without his own will and having none\u00a0guidance, and abandoned\u00a0being\u00a0sent on the path of complete solitude. Imagine yourself in this creature&#8217;s\u00a0shoes, how will you feel? <em>Devastated</em> for sure.</p>\n<p>From Victor\u2019s point of view, the monster is nothing but a hideous and evil creature; from the monster\u2019s account, on the other hand, it becomes clear that he is a thinking, feeling, emotional being. The recounting of the murder of William Frankenstein is a prime example of the impact of perspective: while Victor\u2019s description, colored by the emotional letter from his father, focuses on the absolute evil of the act, the monster\u2019s version of events centers on the emotional circumstances surrounding it. Even if one cannot sympathize with the monster, one can at least understand his actions. This kind of dual narration is one of the more interesting consequences of the complicated narrative structure that Shelley implements.</p>\n<p><em><img class=\"alignright\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/736x/0e/58/d4/0e58d45767ba16d7c0e6dfc8b13f9645.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"181\" height=\"250\" />Frankenstein\u00a0</em>is an exceptionally complex novel, not because it is hard to read, even though it is written in early nineteenth century, I felt it is quite plain in words.

One story called\u00a0<em>Chinatown,</em>\u00a0about a\u00a0teenage boy&#8217;s relationship with a half Vietnamese girl, who woos the girl, takes her virginity and then somehow ends up pimping her out. This will attract a perpetual doubt about the kind of the work, &#8220;Would this have been released if it wasn&#8217;t a famous person?&#8221; In response to that I would say, yes. Why not? if the writing is good. Why is the person has to be celebrity? Does the fame of a person\u00a0matters most?

And that&#8217;s how I came across <b>ZEN IN THE ART OF WRITING by\u00a0<em>Ray Bradbury.</em></b><em>\u00a0</em>It is recommended in many articles and considered one of the motivational ones. So I thought, why not?</p>\n<p>This is a collection of\u00a0twelve\u00a0essays by\u00a0Ray Bradbury\u00a0written at various points of time in his long, rich, fertile and impressive career as a writer.\u00a0He\u00a0shares the wisdom, experience, and excitement of a lifetime of writing through these essays. Many of the essays\u00a0tell his own experience in writing one or another book.</p>\n<p>Bradbury inspires\u00a0me on the point where he tries to explain\u00a0about\u00a0his inspiration that\u00a0comes from ideas buried in his subconscious that bubble up when he just sits and writes about a simple word or idea. He emphasize on the spontaneity while\u00a0writing. He explains that while writing down a piece of what a writer knows about, he should not ignore the occurrence of the spontaneous ideas\u00a0during that\u00a0time. Some of them might be useful. He also emphasizes on practicing writing a lot. For aspiring writers, he has an advice:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em><strong>Conjure the nouns, alert the secret self, taste the darkness \u2026 speak softly, and write any old word that wants to jump out of your nerves onto the page\u2026</strong></em></p></blockquote>\n<p><img class=\"alignright\" src=\"https://ingridsnotes.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/ray-bradbury-quote.jpg?w=176&#038;h=176\" alt=\"\" width=\"176\" height=\"176\" />I must confess I have not read\u00a0any other Bradbury&#8217;s work, and thus I am not going to comment on his style\u00a0of writing.\u00a0On the other hand, the book is less about the craft and mechanics of writing and more about the author&#8217;s experience and motivations.</p>\n<p>So far, the essays in this book has given me some insight but my thirst to know the mechanics of writing is still not satisfied.</p>\n<p><strong>4 out of 5</strong></p>\n", "post_id": 2111, "location": false, "date": "09-08-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Non-Fiction", "art", "Review", "Creativity", "Fiction", "Book", "creative economy", "Reading", "book review", "Austin Kleon", "blog", "Authors", "book reviews", "Steal Like an Artist", "Remix", "literature", "Kleon", "Writing", "Social Web", "author", "Culture", "books", "Design", "Amandeep Mittal"], "text": "<p>Last week I wrote the\u00a0review of <strong><a href=\"http://amandeepmittal.wordpress.com/2014/07/18/book-review-steal-like-an-artist-by-austin-kleon/\" target=\"_blank\">Steal Like an Artist</a> by Austin Kleon</strong>.

Being a writer and an artist himself, he is also a keen observer and a participant of the creative economy in this age of digitization. So I believe being a part of creative economy himself, Kleon&#8217;s manifesto is a better outcome of his wisdom. Thus, I decided, why not post the top five things from the book that I learnt and I tend to implement in my daily ritual.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.kaemould.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Dont-Wait-Until-You-Know-Who-You-Are-to-Get-Started1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"354\" height=\"154\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Kleon urges to take a step towards your creative goal by start doing it. He explains everyone is scared to start something and it is a natural sensation. Nobody knows how to do it. But the important thing here is that you have to do it. And to do it, we have to start.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em>Pretend to be something you\u2019re not until you are\u2014fake it until you\u2019re successful, until everybody sees you the way you want them to.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5099/5580292220_89ce9700e8.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"283\" height=\"212\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em>\u201cWhat should I write?\u201d</em>\u00a0 That&#8217;s what every writer at some point in his career asks himself. And most of them, try to write what they know but Kleon has other thoughts on the subject:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em>The best advice is not to write what you know, it\u2019s to write what you like. Write the kind of story you like best\u2014write the story you want to read.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://redyawning.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/use-your-hands.gif?w=500&amp;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"285\" height=\"214\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Kleon urges you to step away from the screen because sitting still in front of a laptop or a desktop, we\u00a0are all immobile. Our mind does all the work but our body becomes non-existing. Keeping our body into motion provides our brain to think at a higher rate. Kleon\u00a0describes his own working model to keep is his body in motion:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em>I have two desks in my office\u2014one is \u201canalog\u201d and one is \u201cdigital.\u201d The analog desk has nothing but markers, pens, pencils, paper, index cards, and newspaper. Nothing electronic is allowed on that desk. This is where most of my work is born, and all over the desk are physical traces, scraps, and residue from my process.The digital desk has my laptop, my monitor, my scanner, and my drawing tablet. This is where I edit and publish my work.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/netdna.copyblogger.com/images/austin-kleon-desk.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"308\" height=\"308\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Kleon also emphasizes on keeping your day job which gives you money and a routine. Having money in your hand will give you freedom in what you love to do and having a routine will be the driving force for your creative work, because the amount of time you will be getting, you will like to\u00a0achieve your creative goal.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7208/6930319041_058f87466e_z.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"357\" height=\"268\" /></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em>The trick is to find a day job that pays decently, doesn&#8217;t make you want to vomit, and leaves you with enough energy to make things in your spare time.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/236x/1e/45/c0/1e45c0c2ff367666082b70606180ade8.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"318\" height=\"163\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Kleon says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em>The way to get over creative block is to simply place some constraints on yourself.

But what is <strong>Pulp Fiction</strong> anyway? The real\u00a0pulp fiction goes back to the magazines that used cheaper pulp paper in order to sell in great volume to a voracious reading public. These magazines had their heyday in the 1920s, \u201930s and \u201940s.</p>\n<p>It was fiction for the people, for the guy on the crowded subway going to work, or the busy mother with five kids who got a little reading time at night. It was for the people who wanted to be caught up in a fictive dream. It was not written in a style aimed at some elite literati. Pulp fiction\u00a0can be characterized as fast-paced, plot-oriented storytelling of a linear nature with clearly defined, larger than life protagonists and antagonists, creative descriptions, clever use of turns of phrase and other aspects of writing that add to the intensity and pacing of the story. About the American dream gone wrong and how crime does not pay. And it produced many superb writers along the way who transcended the genre.</p>\n<p>The first &#8220;pulp&#8221; was\u00a0Frank Munsey&#8217;s revamped\u00a0Argosy Magazine\u00a0of 1896, about 135,000 words (192 pages) per issue on pulp paper with untrimmed edges and no illustrations, not even on the cover. While the steam-powered printing press had been in widespread use for some time, enabling the boom in dime novels, prior to Munsey, no one had combined cheap printing, cheap paper and cheap authors in a package that provided affordable entertainment to young working-class people. In six years\u00a0<i>Argosy</i>\u00a0went from a few thousand copies per month to over half a million.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Argosy_1906_04.jpg/220px-Argosy_1906_04.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"172\" height=\"260\" /></p>\n<p>Some of the renowned authors such as Isaac Asimov, Jack London, Ray Bradbury, Agatha Christie, Arthur Conan Doyle, Philip K. Dick, H. G. Wells, Mark Twain, and Rudyard Kipling wrote for these pulps.\u00a0While the majority of pulp magazines were anthology titles featuring many different authors, characters and settings, some of the most enduringly popular magazines were those that featured a single recurring character. These were often referred to as &#8220;hero pulps&#8221; because the recurring character was almost always a larger-than-life hero.</p>\n<p>Some of the Popular Pulp Characters:</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/09/The_Avenger_Cover.jpg/250px-The_Avenger_Cover.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"177\" height=\"246\" /><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Princess_of_Mars_large.jpg/220px-Princess_of_Mars_large.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"176\" height=\"264\" /><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Tarzan_of_the_Apes_in_color.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"178\" height=\"257\" /><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/97/Docsavage.jpeg/200px-Docsavage.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"178\" height=\"255\" /></p>\n<p>Pulp magazines often contained a wide variety of\u00a0genre fiction, including: adventure, detective/mystery, sports, war, science fiction, and fantasy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "post_id": 2136, "location": false, "date": "07-30-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["New Yorker", "Entertainment", "Review", "Writing", "Book", "Reading", "archive", "book review", "author", "Authors", "book reviews", "profile", "literature", "free archives the new yorker", "Magazine", "Apollo robins", "Haruki Murakmai Reading", "Tessa Hadley", "Fiction", "Marlon Brando", "Classic", "Truman Capote", "books", "Amandeep Mittal", "The New yorker"], "text": "<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/camp4collective.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/the-new-yorker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"674\" height=\"144\" /></p>\n<p>The New Yorker relaunched its website yesterday with complete makeover signifying the first step in the magazine&#8217;s new focus on the web.\u00a0Part of that initiative is the magazine&#8217;s decision to open up its archives to the general public for the next three months.

When I read Hornby&#8217;s <em>Fever Pitch,\u00a0</em>I was impressed by his writing which is simple yet satirical but not as much as by the book itself.

I am not only impressed by his humorous writing but the well crafted yet simple plot he used and a perfect piece for a light mood reading. By light mood reading I mean the book gets over in not more than a day and yes it did.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Hornby&#8217;s narrator, Rob Fleming, is an early thirty something English guy who runs a London record store. He sells albums recorded the old-fashioned way\u2014on vinyl\u2014and is having a tough time making other transitions as well, specifically adulthood. But he&#8217;s much less good on relationships. In fact, he&#8217;s not at all sure that he wants to commit himself to anyone. So it&#8217;s hardly surprising that his girlfriend decides that enough is enough. So Rob does what a man&#8217;s gotta do and rearranges his record collection. And when this does not hit the spot, he takes to reordering his relationships with women, as if this kind of obsessive categorising is the only way of accessing his emotions. Are all relationships, all rejections, merely repetitions of earlier ones? He goes right back to his first heartbreak.

And I am so overwhelmed with their gratitude to give this amazing, vivid piece of fiction as a review copy. The book is yet to be released and the expected publication is August, 5, 2014.</p>\n<p>The title, <strong>2 A.M. At The Cat&#8217;s Pajamas by Marie-Helene Bertino</strong>\u00a0is as provoking as the book itself. It&#8217;s a story set on Christmas Eve&#8217;s eve, a day in the lives of three characters: Madeleine, a 9-year-old\u00a0who is mourning for her mother&#8217;s death and just wants to sing. Her teacher, Sarina, who has just moved back to Philadelphia after a divorce, and is nervously hoping to reconnect with people from her past, and Lorca, owner of The Cat&#8217;s Pajamas, a legendary jazz club in danger of closing. As these three lost souls search for love, music and hope on the snow-covered streets of Philadelphia, together they discover life\u2019s endless possibilities over the course of one magical night.</p>\n<p>Many writers believe in plotting a story with the increase in the number of pages, taking their time such that a reader will find it easy to immerse himself in the story. Though <em>Marie-Helene Bertino</em>\u00a0debut novel starts with a boom. She defines a plot and her difficult looking storyline consisting majorly three-point\u00a0of views which might be the difficulty but as you keep on reading, you will understand how wise and essential it is to maintain the connection between all the three characters. It turns out quite enrapturing. After reading it and giving it a brief thought, I, somehow ended up in favor of her style of writing and her sentence formations which are not clich\u00e9d. She knows her words well, and with the definite use of them she creates a vivid story that is funny, lively with naturalistic looking characters, and quite pleasing to a reader&#8217;s mood no matter whatever the mood you are in before reading it. This book will try to cheer you up. That&#8217;s how I also ended up reading it in one day.</p>\n<p>However, at a point, the theme ending becomes predictive since there is no other possible outcome of this story but that does not disrupts the interest a reader immerse in this book.</p>\n<p><em>It&#8217;s definitely an\u00a0urban fairy tale.</em></p>\n<p>I am enthusiastic about Bertino&#8217;s future works will definitely be looking forward.</p>\n<p><strong>4 out of 5</strong></p>\n", "post_id": 2148, "location": false, "date": "07-28-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["david fincher", "literature", "Reading", "flash fiction", "book review", "author", "fight club", "Review", "american psycho", "Writing", "blog", "cult fiction", "Book", "books", "bret easton ellis", "Authors", "book reviews", "chuck palahnuik", "transgressive", "Fiction", "Amandeep Mittal"], "text": "<p><em><img class=\"alignright\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1388255631l/375782.jpg\" width=\"145\" height=\"224\">The first rule of the fight club is that you don\u2019t talk about the fight club.</em>&nbsp;Yet,&nbsp;I guess to honor this book with a review, I have to talk about the <strong>FIGHT CLUB</strong>.</p>\n<p>I remember watching the movie a long time back but do not remember when and why I added this book in my TBR list. Let bygones be bygones, so now that I have read it, I can surely tell you few things about.</p>\n<p>In his debut novel, <strong>Chuck Palahnuik</strong>, with some black humor tells a story about an unnamed narrator who suffers from insomnia and seems had enough and feels jaded towards his radical monotonous life. He tries to do differ to transform his life into something gratifying by joining cancer support groups on a regular basis. Meeting people who are on the brink of their deaths does not gratifies him or his life. Then until one day he meets Tyler Durden, his life transforms at a faster rate.</p>\n<p>Tyler Durden, who comes up with the idea of Fight Club\u2013\u2013a group that secretly meets in the basements of bars and holds fights. Soon our narrator becomes highly intimated by Tyler Durden that his knowledge expands and <em>he knows everything Tyler knows.</em></p>\n<p>I tried really hard to get along with this book, but at some point or the other it did disappoint me. In Palahnuik\u2019s technique it is clear that the author is under the influence of other authors like Bret Easton Ellis, and (might be) many more. I don\u2019t know, I haven\u2019t read much of this type of writing, and that is not a bad thing I guess to be under someone\u2019s influence. I think if you are working on a piece under someone\u2019s influence and that piece comes out as a fine product, why not!</p>\n<p>The downside of this book is the much pessimism used that does not have a thrilling effect. I mean, there is <em>American Psycho by Bret Easton Ellis</em> which is a pessimist but the technique used in that book and the technique used by Palahnuik in his book, there is a lot of difference in them. In case of <em>American Psycho</em>, the plot was totally cultivated with some twists to blow off a reader. The plot of <em>Fight Club</em> is adaptable and nurturing. Soon as the turning of the pages becomes a habit of the reader, the end becomes predictable as the author run out of tricks to strike a suspense. With not much twisting it becomes as monotonous as the life of unnamed narrator before the start of the <em>Fight Club.</em></p>\n<p><strong>3 out of 5</strong></p>\n", "post_id": 2158, "location": false, "date": "08-12-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Non-Fiction", "Reading", "book review", "Arthur Conan Doyle", "author", "Review", "crime fiction", "Writing", "fantasy", "Book", "books", "Amandeep Mittal", "Authors", "book reviews", "flash fiction", "how to think like sherlock holmes", "Fiction", "mastermind", "maria konnikova"], "text": "<p><strong><img class=\"alignright\" src=\"https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1355094882l/15805442.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"147\" height=\"222\" />Sherlock Holmes</strong> is one of the most curiosity generator fictional character and has been impressive in his ways for over a century.

Even those people, who haven\u2019t read the books but are always eager and curious to watch adaptions. Many on screen actors have tried cherishing him in their own ways, but few have grasped our curious mind by similarity in looks and characteristics. Sherlock Holmes, by using his simple methods and techniques of observing and deducing things, even the minute details which most of us at the times are ignorant of. He deviate our curious minds towards a disciplined approach and motivates us to remain fully aware of our surroundings and to practice the art of deducing.</p>\n<p><strong>Maria Konnikova\u2019s</strong> <strong>MASTERMIND: HOW TO THINK LIKE SHERLOCK HOLMES</strong> is an exceptional concept. Like the Holmes himself, the book is intellectual and provoking read.

In her work, Konnikova juxtaposes what she terms \u201c<em>System Watson</em>\u201d from \u201c<em>System Holmes</em>,\u201d with the former being that overlooks details and jumps to conclusions based on what seems most likely at the time and the latter being a reflective and disciplined approach which takes everything into consideration before arriving at a conclusion.</p>\n<p>By looking at the title, many would expect that this book would provide techniques for improving the memory but let me be clear on that.

She is currently working on the third and the last book in the trilogy of The Sanctum &#8220;The Prophecy&#8221; which is the finale.

Tell us, a little about yourself and your background?</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>I am a Jersey City Heights girl via Snellville, Georgia, who writes paranormal fiction and is slightly infatuated with tattoos, four-inch heels, ice cream, Matt Damon, scotch, Doc Martens, Laini Taylor, photo booths and dancing like a fool. I\u2019m currently working on The Sanctum trilogy and hope one day soon, everyone is walking around with a copy of The Girl in their pocket or on their Kindle. I have dreams of escaping to the countryside and getting a goat and a burro, but since I seem to be stuck in the city for the time being, I\u2019m willing to settle for some chickens.</p>\n<p>My parents are from South India, Trivandrum and Calicut to be exact, but no one ever thinks I\u2019m Indian, not even fellow Indians. This has been the case my entire life, I\u2019ve blogged about it, and have opened up quite a fascinating dialogue on race and culture and what it means when you don\u2019t quite fit within the parameters and expectations of others.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m the daughter of a surgeon, and would have probably made a damn good doctor myself were it not for the left side of my brain constantly wanting to sing, dance, act or write. I compromised and went to law school instead, a decision I still question to this day.</p>\n<p>I have a younger brother and sister, a freaking awesome husband, fabulous step-daughter, and the coolest son ever. Oh! And I just became an aunt. Squee!</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>What is your area of expertise as a writer? </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know if I have the right to claim any area of expertise as a writer, but I can say that fiction versus non-fiction, I am most definitely a fiction girl. And being even more specific, I love creating and writing paranormal stories, fantastical yarns full of magic and otherworldly creatures.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Do you write every day? Do you follow any writing ritual? </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>I do write every day and if I&#8217;m not able to do so, I feel horrible. It&#8217;s become a need of sorts, something I must do, whether it&#8217;s writing my books or blogging or reviewing other people\u2019s books. My day is not complete without doing a little writing and no matter how tired I am, I make sure the last thing I do is open my laptop and put down some words.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>What motivates you to write? </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Right now, my trilogy, The Sanctum. But really, just the need to put down on paper and give voice to the crazy ideas running around in my head and the characters I find myself creating at the most random moments. I can be in a meeting, discussing anti-money laundering policies and a great idea will briefly cross my mind and I&#8217;ll jot it down somewhere, returning to it later and turning it into a blog post or a chapter in one of my books. Really, it\u2019s a love of words and how they can flow together to create these beautiful phrases that together form fantastic stories &#8211; that&#8217;s what motivates me.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>What do you prefer: Pen or Computer? And how do you stay organized (any methods, systems, tools you use)? </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Computer. Hands down. There is no other way for me because my handwriting is atrocious. I have notebooks full of ideas for The Sanctum trilogy and my handwriting is horrid, so bad that sometimes I can&#8217;t read it myself!</p>\n<p>When I first started writing THE GIRL, book I in The Sanctum Trilogy, I was incredibly organized, working from this highly detailed, work-of-art outline, but during the early parts of writing that book, I found myself feeling very constrained by the outline, almost as if I had to justify each and every time I wanted to deviate from it. My outline became a beast unto itself, with its very own domineering and controlling personality, and finally I had to put it away, shut it down, and make it stop hindering my creative processes. It was the best decision I made; after putting it away, I felt so free and the words just flowed. I haven&#8217;t used one since.</p>\n<p>Now, I make sure I know the beginning of the book and the end &#8211; the rest will fill itself in as I move through the story.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Do you believe in \u201cwriter\u2019s block\u201d? If so, how do you avoid it?</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>I do believe in &#8220;writer&#8217;s block&#8221;, have suffered from it, and worked around it. It\u2019s very real and a total <em>bitch</em> to conquer, but that said, I have my way of working around it when it raises its ugly head and tries to mess with my writing <em>juju</em>.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s super simple: I just keep writing. No matter what. Even if what I produce is total trash and I wind up deleting all of it, I still keep chugging ahead because eventually I will write my way out of the block and get back on track. It&#8217;s worked every time and I&#8217;m certain will work just as well the next time a little case of writer&#8217;s block tries to mess with me.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>What do you like to do when you are not writing?</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Write some more. Just kidding. I love spending time with my family and friends, I love going to the beach, bike riding, barbecuing, traveling, and of course, reading.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>What are you working at the moment? When can we see your next work?</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>I&#8217;m currently hard at work on book III in <em>The Sanctum Trilogy</em>, <strong>The Prophecy</strong>. It&#8217;s the <em>finale</em>, which I&#8217;m finding to be both exciting and quite bittersweet. I hate to say goodbye to Dev, Wyatt, and the gang but am also excited about the finale of their insanely awesome journey. Hopefully, I will have everything ready for publication by the end of this year or early 2015. <em>Fingers crossed&#8230;</em></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Any advice for aspiring writers?</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>I say this all the time: write, write, and write some more. And when you feel like you have nothing left in the tank, pour yourself a shot of tequila and get back at it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong>ABOUT HER READING LIFE</strong></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>Are you a reader?</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Oh my god! That\u2019s like asking me is the sky blue. I am a voracious reader, although admittedly, since beginning to write The Sanctum Trilogy my time to read has been greatly diminished. But even so, I love reading and despite being under major deadlines to finish my books, do my best to make time for it as much as possible. There is nothing quite as amazing as getting lost in the magic of a book, exploring a new world, leading a totally different life, forgetting myself in a brilliant story.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>What do you prefer while reading: Paperbacks or eBooks? </strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I fought eBooks for a long time, but now that I&#8217;ve given into the trend, I have to say they\u2019re rather amazing. Of course, nothing replaces the majesty of a book, holding it in your hands, feeling its heft, listening to the pages turn, the entire experience. However, I must admit, it was quite brilliant being able to carry around <em>George RR Martin\u2019s A Dance of Dragons</em> on my phone versus that beast of a tome that sits on my bookshelf.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>One book that you would read again &amp; again? </strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Gabriel Garcia Marquez\u2019s One Hundred Years of Solitude. Time and time again, I find myself returning to this classic and losing myself in the magic of the Buendia clan. The Lord of the Rings trilogy is another I can read over and over again, enjoying the magic of Middle Earth the tenth time as much as I did the first.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>Your favorite authors? </strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Zora Neale Hurston, Laini Taylor, George RR Martin, and JRR Tolkien.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>What book(s) are you reading at present? </strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I just finished a beta read of Kayti Nika Raet\u2019s third book in her Outsider Chronicles series and it was fabulous. If you haven\u2019t read her books, Niko and Harm, I highly recommend them. They\u2019re so unique. I also finished Rose Montague\u2019s Jade, another unique tale, one full of humor, twists and turns. Next on my list is Christa Wojo\u2019s The Wrong David.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em><strong>PS:</strong> Madhuri likes to\u00a0have her chatty moments, so feel free to hit her\u00a0up any time on <strong>Twitter</strong> at @madhuriblaylock or <strong>Facebook</strong> at <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/thesanctumtrilogy\">www.facebook.com/thesanctumtrilogy</a> or her <strong>blog</strong> at <a href=\"http://www.madhuriblaylock.wordpress.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.madhuriblaylock.wordpress.com</a>.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>PPS: \u00a0GIVEAWAYS from the AUTHOR\u00a0herself!</strong></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignleft\" src=\"https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1389326532l/20503009.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"141\" height=\"226\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignleft\" src=\"https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1399514098l/22051429.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"142\" height=\"228\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>On the Author&#8217;s Request I am happy to give\u00a0two\u00a0<em>lucky READERS,\u00a0</em>two eBook copies of both THE GIRL &amp; THE BOY.

Being curious about the mix and match of the administration world and the world of mafia, I end up finish reading it one go.</p>\n<p>The book is about the colossus business of an American underworld Don who having troubles in maintain and earning profit from gambling, drugs, pornography are just some of his businesses. Taking his wife\u2019s advice he hires business consultant led by the main protagonist who under the tolerance of recession and in awe of some business opts for the job to turn around the fortune for both the don and himself.</p>\n<p>One factor that impresses me and surprises me as well, is by not including any Indian character which is the preference of most of the Indian writers. Previously read few of the Indian writers, I always had this doubt about how it will turn out if an Indian writer\u2019s book go for all foreign characters. And I must say, after reading Sameer\u2019s book my doubt is well cleared and I accept the fact that diversity in writing is essential and an author must experiment with his writing from time to time. You never know, it might turn out to be good or better.</p>\n<p>The plot continuous with a good amount of characters that are quite maintained throughout the book and do fit the plot. The plot moves on with an average pace and a reader can clearly observe and appreciate author\u2019s effort of immersing sub-plots into the main story such that all the pieces fit together at the end.</p>\n<p>About the \u201cmafia-ness\u201d, I do feel it could have been more thrilling if the author had given some more research and attention on this part as the description of the events were a bit na\u00efve. The amount of humor included in the book, helps in creating a steady place and does not let the story for a fall out. I think using humor visibly shows that it is different from a regular thriller and it sums up the na\u00efvet\u00e9s of the mafia part.</p>\n<p>Altogether, it\u2019s a light and interesting read. I will recommend it only\u00a0if you want to read something with a diverse plot, and with a flavor of humor.</p>\n<p><strong>3 out of 5</strong></p>\n", "post_id": 2207, "location": false, "date": "08-10-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["book review", "author", "Mightier than the Sword", "jeffrey archer", "clifton chronicles", "Book", "books", "Amandeep Mittal", "Reading"], "text": "<p>It all started with <em>Only Time Will Tell</em>\u00a0whose copies were sold out the day it was launched by <strong>Jeffrey Archer</strong> in India.\u00a0And now the saga of <em>Harry Clifton</em> also known as <em>Clifton Chronicles</em>,\u00a0stands by\u00a0four books already, with <em>Be Careful What You Wish For</em> the latest release in March 2014, the British author continues to grab reader&#8217;s attention and proving that he is one of those master story-tellers.</p>\n<p>Recently, the last book in the Clifton Chronicles\u00a0is revealed and will be released\u00a0next year in 2015,most probably in February.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://fbcdn-sphotos-a-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpa1/t1.0-9/10517510_763685423674247_5900171991702461205_n.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"305\" /></p>\n<p>I certainly expect a lot more from the author in the last book.

Thus, I feel, I am developing a likeness for these kind of books as I found them more interactive and solving their purpose with some illustrations is quite fruitful to the conscience. These are also a perfect match for people who hesitate to read. And I think since these illustrated books are short in length, they are quite good for recommendations.</p>\n<p><strong>How to be Interesting by Jessica Hagy</strong> is another of those illustrated one. The basic idea which the book tries to convey is quite simple. It\u2019s a \u201cself-help\u201d book about exploring yourself, exposing yourself to wild ideas, instead of being cynical why not be carefree like a child and about being open. These are some major themes that the author tries to focus on with some illustrations and her words. The idea of the book is itself is creative. The book was filled with charts and Venn diagrams to get the author&#8217;s point across while actual text is quite minimal.</p>\n<p>It all started with Ms. Hagy on Forbes.com, where she as a weekly blogger, by creating a <em>How to Be Interesting</em> post that went viral, attracting 1.4 million viewers so far, with tens of thousands of them liking, linking, and tweeting the article. Now, with the book, she tries to deeply explore the ideas that resonated with so many readers to create this small and quirky book with a large and universal message.</p>\n<p>Though it won\u2019t take you more than an hour to read, the book\u2019s lack of proper text and a few of the charts doesn\u2019t make much sense, at least to me.

In recent times, I haven&#8217;t read an Indian author with so much capability, who has so much to say with a tablespoon of humour and elusiveness each.</p>\n<p>I am looking forward to read more of his works in future as he looks like a good prospect for an emerging writer of modern India.</p>\n<p><strong>3 out of 5</strong></p>\n", "post_id": 2231, "location": false, "date": "08-18-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["one minute manager", "book review", "Entertainment", "Review", "author", "self help", "Writing", "Reviews", "Amandeep Mittal", "manager", "Book", "books", "Kenneth blanchard", "Authors", "book reviews", "Reading", "spencer johnson", "summary", "npr"], "text": "<p><a style=\"float:right;padding-left:20px;\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/763362.The_One_Minute_Manager\"><img class=\"\" src=\"https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1348155441m/763362.jpg\" alt=\"The One Minute Manager\" width=\"128\" height=\"196\" border=\"0\" /></a><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/763362.The_One_Minute_Manager\">The One Minute Manager</a> by <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4112157.Kenneth_H_Blanchard\">Kenneth H.

It clearly gave me a new insight to think and work in those practical situations in which I sometimes find myself baffled.

And whatever I have heard about Abraham Lincoln before, it did motivate me to pick him up. Thus, I found this book written by <strong><em>Dale Carnegie</em></strong> called <strong>Lincoln The Unknown</strong>. In past, I have read about Carnegie&#8217;s obsession with Abe Lincoln and I thought his written words on his favorite personality might satisfy my desperation.<br />\nTo some extent, it did. I started this book expecting more about Lincoln&#8217;s childhood and adolescent years. I was curious to know how Lincoln was in his youth. His struggles, and how did he cop up with them. But this book gives just enough insight on his tough years of adolescence.</p>\n<p>This book also provides sufficient detail of his failed love life and troubles in marriage. Carnegie illustrates Lincoln through a thoughtful narration and try to give insights more on his personality rather than &#8216;what happened when&#8217;. At some point, I did feel that the author was a bit too biased or obsessed over the personality as he only gave an overview of some particular situations in his narration where I felt that proper and in depth accountancy should be given if we are talking about Abraham Lincoln. In between, some facts are state before their occurrence in the particular time line and this exhibits the fact that the text is not so well arranged, to some extent.</p>\n<p>The author also give enough detail on Mary Todd, Stephen Douglas and in the end chapters, John Wilkes Booth. I don&#8217;t mind being introduce to some more personalities when reading about a great one already but too much of insight on those is irrelevant while not concentrating on the main person. Mary Todd is one example, in this book. The author emphasizes Mary Todd&#8217;s irrational behaviors to great extent. Although, this information might have been more suitable if the author had given more insight on the person on whom the book is about.</p>\n<p>Overall, the book&#8217;s an average read and cover facts to son extent but don&#8217;t consider it as the book that gives in-depth perception on Abe Lincoln.</p>\n<p><strong>3 out of 5!<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/8251675-aman-mittal\">View all my reviews on Goodreads.com</a></p>\n", "post_id": 2243, "location": false, "date": "09-14-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Non-Fiction", "free books", "Entertainment", "Review", "Writing", "fantasy", "Book", "audiobooks", "Reading", "project gutenberg", "book review", "crime fiction", "book reviews", "public domain", "ebook", "Fiction", "librivox", "Classic", "audiobook", "books", "Amandeep Mittal", "Authors", "E-book"], "text": "<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/LibriVox_logo.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"304\" height=\"103\" />If you read books and you surely get lost into them by procrastinating the world to continue to read <em>\u2018just one more chapter\u2019</em>.

Here are some tips I\u2019ve found useful when searching for audiobooks on LibriVox:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>SEARCH FOR RECCOMENDATIONS</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">If you know someone who listens to audiobooks on LibriVox, ask them what books they&#8217;ve enjoyed. Or, browse the internet for recommended books and narrators. T<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/104911-librivox-book-discussion\" target=\"_blank\">his LibriVox discussion thread on Goodreads</a>\u00a0is an awesome place to get some good and worthy recommendations.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>DOWNLOAD LATEST RECORDINGS</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Popular novels usually have multiple recordings. By default you&#8217;ll be downloading the newest one. Another advantage of latest recording is that you will get more correct context.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>TRY BOTH- COLLABORATIVE\u00a0&amp; SOLO PROJECTS</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">For plays, collaborative projects are \u00a0better. Hearing each character&#8217;s words in a different voice rises a sensational feeling in the reader&#8217;s mind. I often read and hear plays at the same time. I download the audiobook of a specific play/drama and run\u00a0it either on\u00a0my phone or on my laptop and at the same time I read the book in the written form too. It feels like you are in a theater of your own. And since you have have downloaded the file you can pause and play whenever you want.</p>\n<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>Do you love\u00a0audiobooks?

But could they be frightening?<br />\nThe answer is in Jo Nesbo&#8217;s THE SNOWMAN.&#8221;<br />\n</em><br />\nSet in the exotic locations like Oslo and Bergen, <em>Harry Hole&#8217;s </em>seventh adventure in the series is quite a chilling thriller. Imagine Norway in winter, certainly more chilly.</p>\n<p>Due to Nesbo&#8217;s recent popularity due to his translated works, I decided to five him a try. Also I am a fan of crime/mystery fiction, but this year I have decided to diversify my reading and read less number of books related to aforementioned particular genre.</p>\n<p>After reading Stieg Larsson and now Jo Nesbo, I have made an observation that Scandinavian writers have that perspective of naturalism of story telling especially in modern day crime writers. Ian Rankin and Donna Leon are two others who are not Scandinavian, and who have this ability. When they create a plot, it looks so simple yet realistic but the complexity in the plot increases as the reality fastens its grip on a human&#8217;s mind just like in the real world and this results in increase in the interest of a reader in that particular form of writing. This complexity is good and does not restrain irrelevant form of details just to bugger off a reader. Nesbo&#8217;s The Snowman is an example.</p>\n<p>Plot begins when a boy named Jonas wakes in the night to find his mother gone. Out his window, in the cold moonlight, he sees a snowman that inexplicably appeared in the yard earlier in the day. Around its neck is his mother\u2019s pink scarf.</p>\n<p>Harry Hole, an anti-hero police investigator, suspects a link between a menacing letter he\u2019s received and the disappearance of Jonas\u2019s mother and of perhaps a dozen other women, all of whom went missing on the day of a first snowfall. His investigation deepens as he battles down with his own inner demons.</p>\n<p>The book is full of suspense and contain enough twists that will you guessing through most of the it. It becomes predictable in the end when the author is left with the last item in his magic hat. But that&#8217;s not the point. What impressed him is how neatly the plot moves with the characters simultaneously and results in creating a sensational feeling in a reader&#8217;s mind which is what we call the thrill.</p>\n<p>Book&#8217;s pace goes well along with the plot though in between it&#8217;s a bit of a drag, but I managed to cope with that and I am sure you will also.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/8251675-aman-mittal\">View all my reviews on Goodreads.com</a></p>\n", "post_id": 2258, "location": false, "date": "10-05-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Non-Fiction", "Smoke Get into your eyes by Catlin Doughty", "Review", "Fiction", "Book", "&amp; Identity in the Digital Age by Nev Schulman", "Reading", "So We Read On: How The Great Gatsby Came to Be and Why It Endures by Maureen Corrigan", "In Real Life: Love", "book review", "author", "Authors", "book reviews", "new books in September", "ebook", "The Assassination of Margaret Thatcher by Hilary Mantel", "five", "Writing", "friday five", "to read", "Book List", "hilary mantel", "list", "Diane Ackerman", "Lies", "books", "new releases", "Amandeep Mittal"], "text": "<p>September is the beginning of fall.

But that is not advisable from me, for this book.</p>\n<p>The plot revolves around two character or in better words, &#8220;character studies&#8221; of two friends&#8211; a composer, Clive and a newspaper editor, Vernon and there shared dead lover, Molly. Actually, Molly is just a starting point that bounds them to the third character, Julian\u00a0Garmony, a right-wing politician tipped to become the next prime minister, who also share mutual ex-lover as of them. It&#8217;s a sharp contemporary piece which cleverly tries to emphasize on humor but somewhat fails to do so.<br />\nThough the plot might seem interesting and simple but the construction of the plot is a bit absurd. As the plot advances, it is clear that the author seems confused between studying a character or telling a tale morality. If he&#8217;s trying to do both, neither of them goes hand-in-hand with his words. The plot becomes unfocused and boring to a reader in that state, and Ian McEwan leaves a reader with a fast-twisted\u00a0ending, some thought to be given about one&#8217;s own morality and a below par plot.</p>\n<p><em>I am not satisfied with this particular work but that does not mean I am going to give up on his other works.

Many of these anecdotes are fascinating but one about of a man who had absolutely no short-term memory but was able to function as a result of habits already ingrained within him appealed to me. His case clearly demonstrates that there is something distinctive between one part of our brain and another.</p>\n<p>In the book, Duhigg \u00a0tries, with his investigatory narrative by presenting various examples and stories of different people on different aspects of habits, to explain the basis of habit formation, and how can we change those habits. He expressively suggests\u00a0that each habit whether regarding to smoking, drinking, eating high calorie food or even procrastinating one&#8217;s important tasks are all results of habits that have been optimized in one&#8217;s brain.</p>\n<p>Duhigg first became fascinated by the power of habit eight years ago, while in Baghdad as a newspaper reporter. There, he met an army major who was conducting a curious experiment in the small town of Kufa: After analyzing taped footage of riots in the area, the major identified a common sequence \u2014 first a crowd of Iraqis would gather in the plaza, drawing in spectators and food vendors, then eventually someone would throw a rock and all hell would break loose.</p>\n<p>So the major summoned Kufa\u2019s mayor and made a strange request: Get the food vendors out of the plaza. The next time the sequence began to unfold and a crowd started to gather, something different transpired \u2014 the crowd snowballed and people started chanting angry slogans, but by dusk, people had gotten hungry and restless. They looked for the familiar kebabs, but they weren\u2019t there. Eventually, the spectators left and the chanter lost steam. By 8PM, everyone was gone.</p>\n<p>Upon asking the major how he figured out the clever strategy, Duhigg got the following response: <em>\u201cUnderstanding habits is the most important thing I&#8217;ve learned in the army.\u201d</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>The Power of Habit</strong></em> explains the mechanism which Duhigg calls <strong><em>The Habit Loop</em></strong>.This habit loop contains three steps:</p>\n<p><em><strong>(1)</strong> Recognizing the habit you want to change. It can be of about anything from eating a cookie everyday in cafeteria to smoking endless cigarettes in a day to procrastinating your own tasks.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>(2)\u00a0</strong>Recognizing the routine of that habit. In other terms, What drives you to do something that you don&#8217;t want to happen?. Then, on finding another routine to divert your attention towards some other thing and practice the new routine you&#8217;re trying to overwrite the old one, daily.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>(3)</strong> Reward yourself daily, when you successfully concentrate on performing the new routine and in the end, the ultimate reward of this would be the new habit formed.</em></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/ak-rsolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/habit-loop.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></p>\n<p>Of course, generating a new routine and overwriting an old one is not an easy task as it might sound but trying and trying again in most of the cases will work. If you fail with establishing a new routing to bypass the former one, try to make some modifications in\u00a0that new routine you are trying to adapt and that might work.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Change might not be fast and it isn&#8217;t always easy. But with time and effort, almost any habit can be reshaped. -</strong> <strong>Charles Duhigg</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>3.5 out of 5? </strong>For the reason that the author explains same mechanism over and over and advancing towards the end of the book, the narrative makes it a bit boring.</p>\n<p>Still, I&#8217;d <strong>recommend</strong> this book to everyone. The information in this book is very worthwhile.

I read her poems, I watched the movie starring Gwyneth Paltrow who portrayed Sylvia Plath in the movie, which left me unsatisfied with my fascination for the poet. Her words to me were so soothing that, for a month I read nothing else but her poems. This never happened with me before, as I am able to read on an average at least a book a week. But Plath&#8217;s writing got hold of me more and I sank deep down in to the world her words wove around me.<br />\nThus, after reading many of her poems, and I found only two books written by her: The Bell Jar and The Unabridged Journals of Sylvia Plath (which is a non-fictional work). I read both in that order.</p>\n<p>On reading The Bell Jar, her words left me sort of sad soul drain that you feel after you read something both really profound and depressing. Though I was not much affected by much of the story but it did made me wonder, that how a person can write so profoundly in a flow, either he must be suffering from utter depression or his writing skills are extremely accomplished. But I believe only halfheartedly on the latter. I truly believe in the story that if a write writes, no matter how accomplished he is in his skills, somewhere in his words, between the lines, is his own experience of the consequences he had faced previously.</p>\n<p>Plath\u2019s prose is interesting and fractured. The language is not totally outdated and\u00a0is still entirely approachable to the average reader with enough depth behind the words to satisfy the staunchest literary critic.</p>\n<p>The story is about Esther Greenwood a 21-year girl from Boston who hates her mother. She wins a summer internship at a popular magazine in New York. Her mother sends her a write-up on how she can protect her virginity. The story of Esther continues when she moves to New York to work as an intern at the magazine, but soon falls into a deep depression. The first half of the narrative describes Esther\u2019s life in the city, while the latter part tells of her experiences with psychiatrists and mental institutions.</p>\n<p>The connection I made on reading the first half with Esther is interrupted as Plath stops describing the backdrop to the scenes, stops analyzing, stops telling us how Esther feels. I was almost disappointed with the second half because I wanted to feel the madness in Esther, but it wasn&#8217;t crazy, it was depression, cold, languid, mind-numbing depression. This is the point where I guess, Plath\u2019s own experiences inspired her writing, as she tries to manage and capture her character but fumbles down. The later half of the book shows some signs of exhaustiveness that she might have felt on the course of writing, and pressure of managing two small children alone in misery.</p>\n<p><em>The Bell Jar was Plath\u2019s only novel, semi-autobiographical and completed shortly before she committed suicide. It was published under a pseudonym just before she died, in February, 1963.</em></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Perhaps when we find ourselves wanting everything, it is because we are dangerously close to wanting nothing.</strong><br />\n<strong>\u2015 Sylvia Plath</strong></p></blockquote>\n", "post_id": 2331, "location": false, "date": "10-29-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["robin williams", "book review", "author", "Review", "Writing", "Reviews", "dead poets society", "Book", "books", "Amandeep Mittal", "n h klienbaum", "Authors", "book reviews", "Reading", "Fiction"], "text": "<p><a style=\"float:right;padding-left:20px;\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/67238.Dead_Poets_Society\"><img src=\"https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1359814692m/67238.jpg\" alt=\"Dead Poets Society\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" border=\"0\" /></a><strong><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/67238.Dead_Poets_Society\">Dead Poets Society</a> by <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/52601.N_H_Kleinbaum\">N.H.

Or if you are a poet yourself, why do you write it? Try answering this amiable quest for yourself. Stop now, and think about it. Take a moment, describe in one (or many) word(s) as you prefer, &#8216;Why do you <em>read</em> or <em>write</em> Poetry?&#8217;</p>\n<p>Okay then, I guess, you have answered the question for yourself. Now let&#8217;s see what cordial John Keatings has to say on the concerning matter,</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>We don&#8217;t read and write poetry because it&#8217;s cute. We read and write poetry because we are members of the human race. And the human race is filled with passion. So medicine, law, business, engineering&#8230; these are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love&#8230; these are what we stay alive for.</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>The quote is from the <strong>Dead Poets Society written by N. H. Kleinbaum</strong> adapting a movie in to a book that is a simple, short and will probably take same amount of time to read as many of us might have spent on the movie.</p>\n<p>For those who haven&#8217;t watched the movie or read the book, I&#8217;ll summarize the plot: Todd Anderson and his friends at Welton Academy can hardly believe how different life is since their new English professor, the flamboyant John Keating, has challenged them to make their lives extraordinary! Inspired by Keating, the boys resurrect the Dead Poets Society&#8211;a secret club where, free from the constraints and expectations of school and parents, they let their passions run wild. As Keating turns the boys on to the great words of Byron, Shelley, Whitman, and Keats, they discover not only the beauty of language, but the importance of making each moment count.But the Dead Poets pledges soon realize that their newfound freedom can have tragic consequences.</p>\n<p>There isn&#8217;t much to the plot and the characterization as the book takes an assumption that the reader is already familiar with them. Even though, you haven&#8217;t heard about it, and still thinking of giving it a try, go for it. It does brief about main characters.</p>\n<p>The book raise inquisitive yet snooping questions about our teaching methods. Should the teachers must adapt the flamboyant method of John Keatings and instead of just concentrating on the text, should we let each student touch his own heart and let him experience the amiability of life? Or should students must be left alone with their texts and not let them get impressionable at such an early age? The query itself is tough one and must be given a deep thought. The answer to this query will depend from person to person and his/her methods of acceptance as there is no such thing as a perfect answer. It&#8217;s all about the words and ideas that matter and each of them have a tendency to affect the surroundings in both effective and ineffective manner.</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>That the powerful play(of life) goes on, and you may contribute a verse. -WALT WHITMAN</em></p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/8251675-aman-mittal\">View all my reviews on Goodreads.com</a></p>\n", "post_id": 2335, "location": false, "date": "10-17-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["lotr review", "book review", "Read", "LOTR", "Review", "Writing", "write", "Book", "Reading", "Lord of the rings"], "text": "<p>(THIS POST BASED ON THE CONTENT OF THE LORD OF THE RINGS, BY, JRR TOLKIEN)</p>\n<p>Chapter 2</p>\n<p>The Shadows of the Past</p>\n<p><em>Synopsis:</em></p>\n<p>This Chapter has been considered on of the most important chapter of the book by the author himself, Mr. JRR Tolkien. The chapter opens with ugly rumors about Bilbo due to his sudden disappearance. Frodo\u00a0continues to live at Bag End and spend most of his time with his cousins Merry and Pippin. By the time he turns fifty, he has begun to grow restless. And the town is abuzz with the news of Orcs and Trolls and mysterious lands beyond the Shire.</p>\n<p>About this time Gandalf the wizard visits Frodo. They have a long talk concerning the ring that Frodo had inherited from Bilbo. Gandalf tells Frodo about the nature and the history of the ring, which is actually the greatest of the Rings of Power, and was made long ago by Sauron, the Dark Lord of Mordor. He\u00a0explains that the bearer of the ring never ages; for this reason Bilbo lived such a long life and Frodo himself has not shown signs of aging since he got the ring. Also, the ring exerts a mental power on its wearer.\u00a0The ring was forged in the volcano at Mt. Doom(or Orodruin) by the evil Sauron who wants to rule the world. The ring belonged to Gollum<span style=\"color:#003333;\">,</span>\u00a0a Hobbit who owned the ring for a very long time until Bilbo tricked him out of it.\u00a0The power made Gollum evil; since Bilbo is a good man, and he took it with pity and mercy the power of the ring could not make him evil.</p>\n<p>Gandalf tells Frodo that if Sauron gains the ring he will be all- powerful. When Frodo hears this, he is shocked and doesn\u2019t want anything to do with the ring. Gandalf tells Frodo that it is not a simple matter of wanting or not wanting the ring; the ring chose him (Frodo). Gandalf tells Frodo that he must destroy the ring, and the only way this can be done is by throwing the ring back in the Crack of Doom in the depths of Orodruin.</p>\n<p>Frodo decides to leave the Shire in order to protect the people of his village. Just then Gandalf catches Sam Gamgee, the gardener, eavesdropping on their conversation. Gandalf thinks Sam has ulterior motives, but it turns out he only wants to go on this adventure with Frodo, whom he admires.</p>\n<p>As Tolkien himself admired this chapter as the only most important part of the book. The chapter unfolds the secret of the Ring to everyone, that how it was made, why, and by whom, and thus it survived such a long time\u00a0choosing different care-takers.</p>\n", "post_id": 234, "location": false, "date": "06-20-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["essay", "Review", "Writing", "books", "thesis", "shelley", "Lord Byron", "book review", "author", "Authors", "Frankenstein", "Reading", "Reviews", "book reviews", "the last man", "Fiction", "Mary Shelley", "npr", "Classic", "summary", "Percy Shelley", "Book", "Amandeep Mittal"], "text": "<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/966835.The_Last_Man\"><img class=\"alignright\" src=\"https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1392984325l/966835.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"141\" height=\"215\" />The Last Man</a> by <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/11139.Mary_Shelley\">Mary Shelley</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong> My rating: <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1035383419\">3.5 of 5 stars</a></strong></p>\n<p>Critics consider <em><strong>The Last Man is Mary Shelley</strong></em>&#8216;s most important novel after <strong><a title=\"BOOK REVIEW: Frankenstein by Mary Shelley\" href=\"http://amandeepmittal.wordpress.com/2014/07/20/book-review-frankenstein-by-mary-shelley/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Frankenstein</em></a></strong>. Since I read <em>Frankenstein</em>, a few months back, my obsession with the author&#8217;s writing style grew and I wanted to gradually examine Shelley&#8217;s writing by reading her other works.Thus, I picked this 500 pages long novel that explores similar thematic concerns as in <em>Frankenstein</em>, though from a vastly different perspective. The nightmarish story envisions the end of humanity from a ruthless and inescapable plague. Full of heart-wrenching loss, <em>The Last Man</em> tests the resilience of humanity, as well as its capacity for sorrow and grief.</p>\n<p>The storytelling starts at the constant node following the timeline in a similar manner though sometimes, with deep descriptive instances, somewhere it does feel a dragging and one might feel tempt to rush through it. These instances occur only a few number of times most notably when Shelley often passed over the moments of action or character growth with a short summary, but that certainly never affects her descriptions of places or emotional states. Rest of the book does leave a similar impact on a reader as <em>Frankenstein</em> (only, if you have read <em>Frankenstein</em>). Like many other Victorian authors, Shelley felt no need to rush the plot along, nor to curtail her flood of words. Luckily, she backed them up with ideas and feelings, so it was not merely the empty deluge of words.</p>\n<p>The book is very thematically interesting, set in the <em>2090s</em>, Shelley with her magical yet plain-looking words, tries to expose her internal views. Much of the book is a deconstruction of Romanticism, showing how an aesthete&#8217;s optimism never long survives contact with the real world. The reactions to loss and grief are as various as they are in real life: some characters fall into madness, some in to cold and hardheartedness, and others in to deeper conviction to help those still alive.</p>\n<p>Since the story involves a large-scale apocalypse, the inspiration behind the novel is, I guess, intensely personal. At the time of its production, Shelley had suffered a series of tragic, insurmountable losses. By 1819, she had lost three children\u2014one at birth and two in early childhood. In 1824, her husband, the major Romantic poet <em>Percy Bysshe Shelley</em>, drowned in a shipwreck at the age of 29 and friend and fellow poet, <em>Lord Byron</em>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignleft\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.naplesldm.com/MaryShelley.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"203\" height=\"285\" />One can also imagine that her two primary characters, Alan and Lord Raymond, are based, on her husband and <em>Lord Byron</em>. As the plot advances, a reader observes that high-minded, idealistic philosophies described in the text dwindle into irrelevance as society falls apart, man by man, until the reader is left with only the narrator, who believes himself to be the last man on earth. Throughout this process, one can admire with ease and then lose character after character. Thus, this ongoing tragedy makes me feel Shelley\u2019s own personal struggles as she mirrors her own grief by examining it through all the various angles and scenarios afforded by the realm of fiction.</p>\n<p>With the apocalyptic instance, Shelley recognizes the death of mankind as fall of art, of idealism, of love and joy, and all the heights that we have reached, or hoped to reach. The death of man is a tragedy, but till the death arrives, we can only hope to outlive them with advancements in our lives and replacing previous hopes them with new ones.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/8251675-aman-mittal\">View all my reviews on goodreads.com</a></p>\n", "post_id": 2343, "location": false, "date": "10-23-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Non-Fiction", "literature", "Reading", "book review", "Classic", "Review", "author", "Writing", "Reviews", "Book", "books", "Amandeep Mittal", "Authors", "book reviews", "2014", "Fiction", "reading challenge", "Goodreads"], "text": "<p>The year\u00a0<em>2014</em>\u00a0is\u00a0going well for me, at least in terms of reading.

Reading is beneficial, always. Some of the minor challenges are still going on, but many of them are completed along with the major challenge. I am glad to say that I have read 100 books in 260 days. Somehow, it is an achievement for me.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amandeepmittal.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/2.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2352 size-large\" src=\"https://amandeepmittal.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/2.png?w=1024&#038;h=603\" alt=\"2\"   /></a></p>\n<p>I track my books on <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Goodreads.com</em></a>. They have special widget, every year, called the Reading Challenge, in which a reader can challenge himself by\u00a0setting a numerical value on his own estimations and pledge to read books to complete it. <em>Goodreads.com</em>, never forces anyone to read a number of books, or what kind of books and it&#8217;s all about your self-discipline and will-power, your own curiosity and interests.</p>\n<p>The reading challenge widget also has tracker that tracks the books which you have read in that particular year.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amandeepmittal.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/3.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2350 \" src=\"https://amandeepmittal.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/3.png?w=329&#038;h=585\" alt=\"3\" width=\"329\" height=\"585\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Challenging yourself is just way of keeping yourself indulged in the\u00a0reading activity.

I often regret on not coming across his books in my childhood as each of them are fascinating and Matilda is no exception.</p>\n<p>The book&#8217;s a pure work of fiction, a classic I&#8217;d say. The story revolves around a five year old girl, Matilda who starts knocking off double-digit multiplication problems and reading Dickens. Even more remarkably, her classmates love her even though she&#8217;s a super-nerd and the teacher&#8217;s pet. But everything is not perfect in Matilda&#8217;s world. For starters she has two of the most idiotic, self-centered parents who ever lived. Then there&#8217;s the large, busty nightmare of a school principal, Mrs. Trunchbull, a former hammer-throwing champion who flings children at will and is approximately as sympathetic as a bulldozer.</p>\n<p>For revenge and with patience, she warms up with some practical jokes aimed at her helpless parents, but the true test comes when she rallies in defense of her teacher, the sweet Miss Honey, against the diabolical Trunchbull.</p>\n<p>Even though the story might sound plain, it is not as the essential point about the plot is that it is unpredictable. This lenghty book captures Dahl&#8217;s words and imagination and in an efficient manner. The emotional truth which Dahl makes a reader to understand and feel is the most essential part I found to deal along with the story of Matilda. The book is wholesomely funny and the character of Matilda will be engraved in a reader&#8217;s mind, for the rest of his life. Her love for books at such an early age is another essential part I feel is what we need to our younger generation to realise. It is only by reading books that Matilda found the power of being patient and not getting sad and too frustated even when her self-centered parents abused her habit of reading and the rest of her childhood. Other characters such as her parents and Trunchbull are the plain description of the immoral morons whom one have to face again and again through out their life. The key is, as I said before, to be patient and use your knowledge in such a manner to be compeltely avenged. However, the character of Miss Honey is dream character that every one dreams of being or having one when they were children. And if one recalls his childhood, one might find traits of Miss Honey in some or the person.</p>\n<p>Roald Dahl has got a brilliant, and a unique voice. It&#8217;s a touching and a funny story with a worthful ending and I would recommend this book to any person belonging to any age.</p>\n", "post_id": 2370, "location": false, "date": "11-23-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Fiction", "Non-Fiction", "book review", "books releasing in november 2014", "Review", "Writing", "Reviews", "Book", "books", "new", "book reviews", "2014", "November", "Reading", "releases"], "text": "<p>Had a busy October.

All of these and many others too. Every post is like an attachment to a file that consists of details matching a\u00a0reality which I was surrounded by the specific\u00a0course of time. It&#8217;s a like a voyage in the past and reading through your journal. It makes me feel happy, abolishes any sense of voidness and at the same time bequeaths me to continue to do what I do.

Tell us, a little about yourself and your background?</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Hi Aman, thank you for your interest in my little book! To give you a bit of background, I come from the West Coast of the United States, I&#8217;ve lived in California, Oregon, and\u2014above all\u2014Washington.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>What is your area of expertise as a writer/artist or an online publisher?</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>I have no expertise that qualifies me to do what I do: I got my degree in music (composition), so mostly I dealt with notes and rests. But I was always interested in literature and art: at the end of high school and the beginning of college I was a poet with a very modernist (like, 1910s modernist) aesthetic. But in college I related to the music people more than the English majors (for reasons that don&#8217;t merit going into, I missed out on band/choir/orchestra culture in high school) and I had a knack for music theory, so I replaced one kind of writing with another. I never took any studio art classes in college: I sampled a bit of art history, but for some reason\u2014even though I was allowed to be a music major without much of a musical background\u2014I didn&#8217;t feel like I belonged in drawing or painting classes. Oh well.</p>\n<p>The connection from then to now is fuzzy, but I&#8217;ve always felt a need to do something creative\u2014to write songs, essays, whatever\u2014and for a long time that wasn&#8217;t happening.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Congratulations on your debut book, HORN! It has some amazing book reviews. All of your reviews are in a form of illustrated strips. How did you come up with the idea at first?</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>It is\u00a0about five years ago I decided to make these dumb little autobiographical webcomics. I was inspired partly by Scott McCloud (in particular his books Understanding Comics and Making Comics), and partly by the art of podcasting that was still pretty new at the time: my thing was visual, not audio, but the spirit of doing something by yourself, putting it out for free, and learning how to do things as you do them\u2014that was and is the guiding star.</p>\n<p>So I did that for a year, and then when The Rumpus Book Club came into existence, I adapted my 9-panel black-and-white webcomic into a book review strip. The Rumpus liked the first three reviews I made and asked me if I wanted to be on the comics roster. After I&#8217;d been doing it every other week for three years, OR Books approached me about a collection. Everything I have is thanks to luck and the kindness of strangers.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Do you write/illustrate every day? Do you follow any ritual?</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Some days I read, some days I draw. I have my own rituals, but mostly they are procrastination measures. I (like most people, I think) am always fascinated by writers&#8217; routines, but I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything universal you can derive from studying the habits of creatives. I work mostly at night. I have a cozy workspace. As long as I&#8217;ve got beer to drink and comedy podcasts to listen to, and my shoes are tied tightly, then I&#8217;m ready to go.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>What motivates you to continue your work?</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>What motivates me to keep going is that I&#8217;m not yet good at what I do, and wouldn&#8217;t we all like to be good at what we do? The other things that motivate me are probably universal: to make people like me, to make money (in a hypothetical universe), to fend off death and thoughts of death by using whatever power you have to turn chaos into order and thus temporarily reverse entropy.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>What do you prefer: Pen or Computer? And how do you stay organized (any methods, systems, tools you use)?</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>I don&#8217;t do a lot of writing in my reviews (maybe 70 words or fewer), so I usually just draft them on the computer, in an email to myself. Then I design the comics on Bristol board in blue pencil, ink them using brushes &amp; Pigma Micron pens and then reduce &amp; scan them. I&#8217;m very low-tech. If I were faced with having to make comics inside the computer itself I don&#8217;t know what I would do.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Do you believe in \u201cwriter\u2019s block\u201d or in your case an &#8220;illustrator&#8217;s block&#8221;? If so, how do you avoid it?</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>I&#8217;m sure writer&#8217;s block is real and I can&#8217;t understand the people who claim to be unaffected by it. For me it manifests in two ways: 1. general procrastination\u2014knowing what you have to do, just not wanting to start it; and 2. lack of ideas. The first problem can be solved by deadlines whether real or artificial, but the second problem is more chronic. The classic example is Seinfeld: the best story ideas on that show came from Larry David; Jerry Seinfeld specialized in form/technique/structure. I wish I had Larry David&#8217;s gift: I&#8217;m good at figuring out how to craft a solution to an artistic problem, but if I have an original idea it&#8217;s a very lucky day.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>What do you like to do when you are not writing/</strong> <strong>illustrating?</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>My hobbies probably don&#8217;t even qualify as hobbies. I like to get intoxicated and watch TV or play the Wii. I like to cook. Sometimes I think I would like to be an outdoorsy person or an exercise enthusiast, but then I remember that you can see every episode of Cheers or The X-Files on Netflix.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>What are you working at the moment? When can we see your next work?</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>I&#8217;m working in watercolor right now, and that&#8217;s pretty exciting. It&#8217;s a comics adaptation of selections from the gnostic Gospel of Thomas, and will be out sometime next year. I also have a Horn! review coming out in print soon, but I&#8217;ll keep you updated on both of these things as they get announced.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Thanks, Kevin. I am looking forward to them. So, Any advice for aspiring writers?</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>I have no advice for aspiring writers, because I think aspiring writers are more clever and hard-working than I am. The cliche advice is always true: do it every day, read more than you write, submit constantly and collect rejections&#8230;. But you can do all of this and fail or you can do none of this and get lucky. You can also die tomorrow. Who knows.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1400509848l/22002162.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"242\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong>Okay. a quick round about your READING LIFE</strong></span></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>\u00a0Are you a reader?</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Yes, of course I&#8217;m a reader! But not as good a reader as I wish I could be. There&#8217;s something magical about being inside a book, for the brief time that you are in one, but unless I&#8217;m reading for a review, books have a difficult time competing with TV, movies, drugs, alcohol, podcasts, Twitter, video games, and music for my attention.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong> What do you prefer while reading: Paperbacks or eBooks?</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>I am not a print purist\u2014I have a Kindle and love the ability to search a book (or all of your books) for a certain word combination. And it&#8217;s nice to get a book from NetGalley to read for review, or to get something from Amazon that&#8217;s been ridiculously discounted. But for the most part I would prefer a paperback\u2014or hardcover, but I have to take the dust jacket off or I&#8217;ll go crazy. And if there&#8217;s a deckle edge I usually get sad because that means (as with e-books) that riffling through the pages is pretty much impossible.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong> One book that you would read again &amp; again?</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>I haven&#8217;t re-read a book in a long time. I used to like to do it with A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (which should be read in late March/early April), and I should probably read that again sometime soon. But I haven&#8217;t been a re-reader since I started reviewing books: every twice-read book is a lost opportunity to discover something new. On the other hand life is short and you should read what you want to.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong> Your favorite authors?</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>My favorite authors are the ones that make me laugh. Modernists: James Joyce, Vladimir Nabokov, Italo Svevo, Ralph Ellison, Flann O&#8217;Brien. Contemporaries: Francine Prose, Donna Tartt, Jonathan Lethem, Sam Lipsyte, Yannick Murphy, etc. People whose books blow my mind and I wouldn&#8217;t have known it were it not for these reviews: Shane Jones, Barbara Browning, Sara Levine, Karolina Waclawiak\u2014someone is always at work writing something crazy, funny, and moving. My personal favorite example of this type of writing is Tell Me That You Love Me, Junie Moon by Marjorie Kellogg (made into a movie starring Liza Minnelli)\u2014I haven&#8217;t read it again since the first time, but if you can map the genome of that book, you&#8217;d have the key to what I love about the novel.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong> What book(s) are you reading at present?</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>I have too many books to read right now and am kind of hiding from them. But if I were reading, I would most likely be reading nonfiction: Bad Feminist by Roxane Gay, the new expanded edition of Let&#8217;s Talk About Love by Carl Wilson, Against Football by Steve Almond, Bowie by Simon Critchley, and Enter Talking by Joan Rivers (rest in peace).</p>\n<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>Look out for Kevin&#8217;s Book <a href=\"http://www.orbooks.com/catalog/horn-collected-reviews/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>HORN!

It&#8217;s a tale of a man trying to endure alone on the incredibly inhospitable planet of Mars. But it&#8217;s not the tension of survival that makes<em> Andy Weir&#8217;</em>s debut novel brilliant, it&#8217;s the humor.</p>\n<p>In the middle of nowhere, Mark Watney, a botanist and a mechanical engineer, without his crew who were forced by a dust storm to leave him behind, thinking he was dead, wakes up some time later to find himself stranded on Mars with a limited supply of food and no way to communicate with Earth or his fellow astronauts. Thus, Mark, with his good sense of humor and his &#8220;smart-ass&#8221; trait tries to overcome a series of increasingly tricky mental, physical and technical challenges just to stay alive, until finally, he realizes there is just a glimmer of hope that he may actually be rescued.</p>\n<p>This book made my bad mood turn into an extreme bliss, I ended up finishing it in matter of hours. Not even a &#8220;Sol&#8221;. Hours. It never felt that I was reading a novel of 350 plus pages. Just like rescuing the Martian, Andy Weir writing will rescue a reader from any abnormal state of mind, no matter how deadly it is, it can&#8217;t be deadlier than being left behind on a desolated planet.</p>\n<p><strong><em>&#8220;How Aquaman can control whales?</em></strong><br />\n<strong><em>They&#8217;re mammals! Makes no sense.&#8221;</em></strong></p>\n<p>Humor comes with the aid of geekiness. The technological details, even like the minute ASCII characters to very detail of growing potatoes, cracking up the hydrazine (rocket fuel) to make water and &#8220;other nerdy stuff&#8221;, Weir&#8217;s efforts does not go empty-handed. Each effort he has put in shows clever display of his own love for technology, and using the right amount certainly does not bores a reader to tears. Furthermore, the book tackles with human emotions. With just a few paragraphs devoted to letters from Watney to his crew, Weir establishes the beautiful amity between them. Similarly, the crew\u2019s phone calls home breathe life into each supporting character, whether they\u2019re reassuring their spouse, sibling, or a worried parent.</p>\n<p><strong><em>\u201cRuining the only religious icon I have leaves me </em></strong><br />\n<strong><em>vulnerable to Mars Vampires. I\u2019ll have to risk it.\u201d</em></strong></p>\n<p>Weir procures\u00a0a reader to an exploration and along with that, he generates a simple thought about the survival of an individual in such extremely hostile conditions rather than worrying and vexing upon on minute proceedings of our daily lives.</p>\n<p><strong><em>&#8220;Every human being has a basic instinct to help each other out.</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>It might not seem that way sometimes, but it&#8217;s true.&#8221;</em></strong></p>\n<p>Even the film rights to the book have been sold, and a version of the story may appear on the big screen in next two years, but it\u2019s hard to imagine that the movie version would be better than the book.</p>\n<p><strong><em>The Martian is a story hard to put down, sharp, funny, thrilling, it&#8217;s a complete package.

Madhuri&#8217;s &#8216;accustom to a reader&#8217; writing does wonders. It hooks a reader, grabs his attention just as one is on an edge of wherever he currently resides, until one is\u00a0done with it. It straightway picks where the first one landed and takes a reader to another unforgettable experience.\u00a0I was pulled in From the beginning and am amazed of well written and descriptive the story is. Plotting is notable and noble. Recurrence of POVs between characters didn&#8217;t affect me much this time, I guess I am used to it now. The pace is one again of my favorite part about this book. I enjoyed the second part even better.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In <em>The Girl</em>, Madhuri Blaylock introduced readers to the world of The Sanctum, one corrupted by greed and savagery and hellbent on achieving a single goal: destroying the prophesied hybrid. When one of its most celebrated warriors questioned his allegiances, age-old secrets were unveiled and violence erupted. The journey becomes more perilous and intense as the trilogy surges forward with <em>The Boy</em>.\u00a0Dev and Wyatt change all of that when the prophesied hybrid lands on the steps of Rinshun Palace, seeking help for the wounded Class A Warrior. That decision alters lives and sets old agendas back on course.</p>\n<p><strong><em>The Boy\u00a0is the second\u00a0book in THE SANCTUM Trilogy.\u00a0</em>I think I&#8217;ll have to wait for the third.</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<p><em><img class=\"alignright\" src=\"https://amandeepmittal.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/mb.jpg?w=137&amp;h=137\" alt=\"\" width=\"137\" height=\"137\" />I\u2019d like to thank the author as I received this book from the author herself, in exchange of the honest feedback.</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">You can visit her at the\u00a0<a href=\"http://madhuriblaylock.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>I recently <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">interviewed</span> her, so check out our <a title=\"AUTHOR INTERVIEW: The one with Madhuri Blaylock\" href=\"http://amandeepmittal.wordpress.com/2014/08/03/author-interview-the-one-with-madhuri-blaylock/\" target=\"_blank\">gossips</a>!</strong></p>\n", "post_id": 2405, "location": false, "date": "10-26-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Non-Fiction", "manchester united", "the second half", "book review", "autobiography", "Review", "roddy doyle", "Writing", "Reviews", "roy keane", "Book", "books", "books book review", "book reviews", "Reading", "memoir", "biography"], "text": "<p><a style=\"float:right;padding-left:20px;\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23353852-the-second-half\"><img class=\"alignright\" src=\"https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1412998234l/23353852.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"155\" height=\"235\" /></a><strong><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23353852-the-second-half\">The Second Half</a> by <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/128323.Roy_Keane\">Roy Keane</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong> My rating: <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1078070579\">4 of 5 stars</a></strong></p>\n<p><em>&#8220;Reading Keano&#8217;s memoir was like seeing through his mind and heart. Very candid.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>After reading a few autobiographies of players and staff associated with Manchester United, certainly the biggest premiership club in past two decades, now in turmoil, <strong>Roy Keane&#8217;s The Second Half</strong> is one of the most honest and straightforward memoir I have ever read.</p>\n<p>For me and some might agree, keeping apart his big-mouth quality which I consider his trait as a part of being a leader, was not a &#8220;top, top player&#8221;. His peak would be the 1999 season, Champions League semi-final, scoring a header against Juventus and sending Manchester United straight to the finals. Other ups in his career, strong personality or pretended to be, supporting his players when needed, encouraging newcomers, fighting the battles on and off the pitch. Of course, I am not going to talk about his downs, for that you have to read them in his own words in which he justifies his course of actions and regret on being such a big-mouth. We all live with ghost of our pasts called &#8216;regrets&#8217;. He is indifferent.</p>\n<p>The book straight starts with Keane&#8217;s incident on Alf Halaand, which Keane believes that he still accuses him of ruining\u00a0his playing career. Moving forward, the main attraction, as media claims, should be when Manchester United tore up his contract after Keane lambasted his teammates in an interview with the club\u2019s television channel. On reading, a reader will be able to judge by his own conscience.</p>\n<p>The main focus of this memoir, was what happened to Roy Keane after his playing career got over by a battle-worn hip and how ended up on being appointed as a manager of Sunderland F.C., bringing them from Championship to Premier League, Ipswich Town, and finally as an assistant manager of Aston Villa currently. Reading on, it is more of an aftermath of later half of his life. Talking about regrets, Keane goes on explaining the difference between a person&#8217;s anger and a person&#8217;s frustration. Anger can be understood as an emotion, can be used as a driving force but frustration is an outburst. In any case it must be avoided, if not the outcome will vary from injuring an opponent to wrecking your own career. And that is what Keane&#8217;s memoir is all about. Along with his mental sufferings, unsophisticated mind, and living in a conundrum of his own, he observes the difference between the two and accepts them. Moved on, did the same mistake. Moved on hoping for a betterment. That&#8217;s life, but one must be waken enough to determine the difference between the two&#8211; <em>anger</em> and <em>frustration</em>, and should be clear on whom to avoid and when. Sport&#8217;s is that profession in which the practice of the aforementioned subjects can be easily determined and are segments of every sport.</p>\n<p>For Roy Keane, it&#8217;s quite hard to consume the fact that football is mostly business. Technically, it&#8217;s wrong for any sport and every sport must be considered as a &#8216;sport&#8217;, but to earn and put food on the table for your family, for sportsmen it&#8217;s a job and any job is the part of a business.</p>\n<p><em>Overall, the memoir is well written purely in &#8216;Keano&#8217; style and I will recommend it to any football fan.</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amandeepmittal.wordpress.com/book-reviews/\">View all my reviews</a></p>\n<p><strong>Tell me about your favorite memoirs of a Sporting Personality?</strong></p>\n", "post_id": 2408, "location": false, "date": "10-14-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Reading", "the martian", "book review", "author", "andy wier", "Review", "mars", "Writing", "Reviews", "book reviews", "Book", "books", "mangalyaan", "Authors", "Interview", "Fiction"], "text": "<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em><strong><img class=\"alignright\" src=\"https://d.gr-assets.com/authors/1382592903p5/6540057.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"177\" height=\"153\" />Andy Wier\u00a0</strong>the\u00a0author of </em><a href=\"http://amandeepmittal.wordpress.com/2014/11/06/book-review-the-martian-andy-weir\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>The Martian</strong></a><em>, his first novel, does not need an introduction from me.

Let&#8217;s see what Andy has to say.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>Hi Andy, and thank you for agreeing this interview. Congratulations on the success of <em>The Martian</em>, an amazing read. Tell me a little about yourself and your background?</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I\u2019m 42 years old and I live in Northern California. I\u2019m a lifelong fan of manned and unmanned spaceflight and a science nerd. I\u2019ve been a computer programmer for 25 years, and I only recently quit that profession to go full-time on writing.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>You got a job at 15, while most of us were still struggling through the days of puberty. How?</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I grew up in Livermore, CA, and there are two major government laboratories at the far end of town. They employed (at the time) about 25% of the whole city. Sandia Labs did a community outreach program where they hired local kids to be lab assistants. So I was hired basically as a test-tube cleaner, menial labor kind of thing. The lab I worked for needed some data analyzed on a computer, so they handed me a book on how to program computers and told me to learn how. That began my software engineering career.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong><em>The Martian </em></strong><strong>was originally self-published. Does the print version differs from the first edition?</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">There are no significant plot or character differences. Just a lot of cleanup and smoothing out. The print edition is much better in terms of readability. It benefitted greatly from the diligent work of Julian Pavia, the editor at Random House who whipped it in to shape.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>Considering the amount of generous humor (which were my favorite parts) you have put in that does make <em>Mark Watney</em> a real life character along with aid of technology. How did both indulged in a package together?</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I wanted to be physically accurate, but I was worried that long, technical explanations would be boring to read. So I tried to make the main character funny. That way, the exposition would be entertaining to read.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>What was your first intent\u2014to write a novel or to write a science fiction novel?</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">My focus was on the <em>science</em>, definitely.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>While writing <em>The Martian</em>, did you follow any writing ritual? How about writer\u2019s block? Did that \u201cson of a scumbag\u201d interfered?</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I didn\u2019t have any problems with writer\u2019s block. The plot is very simple, and each element led to the next.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>Your insight of Mars did make me feel alive on that red planet. You must have put a lot of efforts on studying about it to construct such a surreal environment for a reader?</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I did a lot of research, yes. I wanted everything to be as accurate as possible. And, of course, this is my hobby. So doing the research was fun for me.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>Would you like to go to <em>Mars</em>, one day?</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">No, actually. I\u2019m not a brave person. I would be too afraid to go on such a dangerous trip.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>Recently read that you are a <em>\u201cWhovian\u201d </em>too<em>!</em> Being <em>Whovian</em> myself, I could not resist to ask you about your favorite Doctor? Would you like to write a Doctor Who story? Or are you already up with one?</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I love Doctor Who. My favorite doctor is the <em>Fifth</em> (Peter Davison). It would be a dream-come-true to write a script for an episode.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>What is your opinion on <em>Mangalyaan (Mars Orbiter Mission \u2018MOM\u2019), </em>a spacecraft launched last year and now successfully mingling in Mars orbit, by the ISRO (<em>Indian Space Research Organization)</em>? Do you think NASA takes it as a competition or do you feel it doesn\u2019t matter until it benefits the humanity?</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I\u2019m very happy with any probe successfully reaching Mars! <strong><em>ISRO</em></strong> is the first space agency to get to Mars on their first try. It\u2019s an incredible accomplishment and they should be proud. I don\u2019t think NASA is worried about \u201ccompetition\u201d anymore. The Space Race has been over for a long time.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>What do you like to do when you\u2019re not writing?</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I enjoy playing board games with my friends and I am an amateur bartender.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>There is an affirmative possibility of a movie on your novel The Martian. How did you take up the news? Are working on the script? </strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I\u2019m very excited about the possibility of a film. The script was written by Drew Goddard, and the film is set to be directed by Ridley Scott. Matt Damon has signed on to play Mark Watney.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>Are you working on anything at the moment? When can we see your next work?</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I\u2019m working on my next novel now, tentatively titled <strong><em>\u201cZhek\u201d</em>.</strong> I hope to release it late next year.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>Do you have any advice for aspiring writers?</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">My advise is \u201cWrite!\u201d. It\u2019s easy to get caught up in world-building and daydreams about your novel. The hard part is to actually write it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1377707689l/18007564.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"177\" height=\"269\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong>About ANDY&#8217;S Reading Life</strong></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>Are you a reader?

This also raises a question of our dependency on them, but, for now, let&#8217;s not get into that.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 188px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://myeyesbleed.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/htc_p34001.jpg?w=178&#038;h=315\" alt=\"\" width=\"178\" height=\"315\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">An HTC P3400i</p></div>\n<p>My history with gadgets goes back to my teenage days, only a few years, when I first got my hands on a PDA. I had my hands on desktops when the word computer was just started getting to be a buzzword in my country. I know, PDAs\u00a0are more of an ancestral property nowadays but back then, they were &#8216;the thing&#8217;. I still have HTC P3400i, though is in no league with smartphones we use nowadays, but it still fascinates me. It has a Windows Mobile 6 operating system with 64 megabytes RAM <em>(<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory\" target=\"_blank\">Random Access Memory</a>)</em> and a 2.8 inch display with just 128 megabytes of internal memory. Compare it with any basic mobile phone of today and you will find even the cheapest and basic ones have more power than that. And yet in those days, it was the king of all hills.</p>\n<p>Thus with time, technology advances at a faster rate and it is not easy to be satisfied with a gadget for more than a year. They will keep getting better but it&#8217;s your decision to choose and use them smartly. I believe, every gadget an individual owns must be fascinating to himself or herself. I am still fascinated by my old PDA device that supports only 64 megabytes of memory. That&#8217;s an important aspect of being comfortable of what you use, and this also helps in increasing the productivity.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2429\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://amandeepmittal.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/1320_20141025_18_10_28_pro.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-2429 size-large\" src=\"https://amandeepmittal.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/1320_20141025_18_10_28_pro.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=575\" alt=\"1320_20141025_18_10_28_Pro\"   /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Unpacking the MacBook Air</p></div>\n<p>So yes, MacBook Air, seems\u00a0a fascinating <em>&#8216;ultraportable with enough power&#8217;</em> machine to me.

These people disappoint me. I feel pity for them, for their no matter how witty they think they are, their wit\u00a0fails to understand a\u00a0simple fact that reading literature is as important as\u00a0breathing for any living organism. Reading literature is not a waste of time but experiencing a variety of things in lesser time.</p>\n<p>Each book\u00a0gives an individual an access to variety of emotions, events and situations that even for a witty mind, it will take decades to experience all that when one can experience over a short period of time by reading books. It&#8217;s more like a reality simulator.</p>\n<p>Books\u00a0prepare us for life. Even though many people won&#8217;t admit, it is always the literature though in the form of stories or books they have read during in their school or stories in their religious books. It always the stories that stays in their mind through out the course of life, not algebraic formulas or geometrical progressions. Literature is diverse and has ability to take one to journeys to the centre of almost anything a human mind can imagine and gets\u00a0fascinated.</p>\n<p>Words in books, open our hearts and minds.

Without them, I would not have written this, and you won&#8217;t be reading this either. In spite of that, computers should\u00a0be considered only the second most important\u00a0innovation, as important as Gutenberg&#8217;s wooden printing press.

Ada Lovelace, is chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage&#8217;s early mechanical general purpose computer, the Analytical Engine.\u00a0Her notes on the engine include what is recognised as the first\u00a0algorithm\u00a0intended to be carried out by a machine. Because of this she is often called\u00a0the world&#8217;s first computer\u00a0programmer.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 342px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.chronarion.org/ada/AnalyticalEngine.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"332\" height=\"274\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Replica of Analytical Engine</p></div>\n<p>The book\u00a0tracks the stories in a \u00a0linear perspective, from the 19th century&#8211; Lovelace and Babbage to \u00a0Alan Turing, ENIAC, John Von Neumann, \u00a0to Ethernet and Xerox, to Gordon Moore, Robert Noyce, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, Linus Trovalds, Tim Berners- Lee, Sergey Brin and Larry Page. He covers almost all of these people and how their creativity helped them harness not only their goals, but also the clear and visible difference brought in an entire culture of people as well as formulating the <em><strong>digital era</strong></em>. Many of their innovations are now important aspect of an individual&#8217;s thinking, his actions and his overall growth. Imagine, the usual life without internet. This is a story of individuals with brilliant ideas. There is sometimes collaboration of people, sometimes when people work on their own and yet at the end of it all, the reader is left with more clarity on them and the various eras in which different ideas were shaped and formed.</p>\n<p>There have been countless books written on the <strong><em>digital era</em></strong><em>, the one that\u00a0</em><i>constitute us as segments</i>\u00a0but \u00a0Walter Isaacson\u2019s book is different in the sense that he takes a complete look at the innovators, the geniuses, the hackers, and the geeks and what they did and did not do to make their contributions in the digital era. <strong><em>The Innovators</em></strong> is a book which looks at everything, right from the start, to the middle and the future of entrepreneurs and creative geniuses.</p>\n<p>Along with her love for machines, Ada Lovelace is the first known\u00a0specimen of &#8220;Poetical Science&#8221;, a term used by Isaacson in the concluding pages of his book quite relevantly.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 235px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.allonrobots.com/images/Ada_Lovelace.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"357\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ada Lovelace</p></div>\n<blockquote><p>We humans can remain relevant in an era of cognitive computing because we are able to think different, something that an algorithm, almost by definition cannot master [&#8230;] -<em>Walter Isaacson</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>This is well said and there is no point of argument that instead of considering artificial intelligence the &#8220;holy grail&#8221; and concentrating\u00a0all our efforts to make a machine better than us which is not a feasible aspect because of a reason that a machine and a human can never think on the same grounds.

Everyone is indeed crazy, but the craziest are the ones who don&#8217;t know they&#8217;re crazy; they just keep repeating what others tell them to.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>The fundamental question that the author puts forth on is what madness actually is. We all seem to have ideas on what madness is, but Coelho&#8217;s book provides an answer which we all know but have a kind of fear or hesitation to implement it.</p>\n<p>But yes, what is madness? Creating our own world and choosing to live in it, without concern about other things that do not matter. That what madness is. Thus, puts Einstein, Columbus, even Edmund Hillary and the Beetles on the list of madmen. To quote in words of one the characters, &#8216;<em>All of us, in one way or another, are mad.&#8217;</em></p>\n<p>The narrative begins with Veronika, an attractive 24-year old Slovene musing on her life just after she swallows sleeping pills in an attempt to commit suicide. The reasoning she gives herself for this is the monotous act she has to perform on each and every day of her life. The reasoning she leaves behind for others is that it was extremely saddening for her that an French journalist had begun an article with the rather words: \u2018Where is Slovenia?\u2019</p>\n<p>Veronika ends up in the Villete, the infamous Slovenian mental asylum. She meets fellow patients Zedka, who is suffering from chronic depression, Eduard the schizophrenic, and Mari, a lawyer plagued by panic attacks. She soon learns that the intake of a very heavy dosage of sleeping tablets had damaged her heart to such an extent that death is inevitable at the current point.</p>\n<p>In the course of her stay, she develops a relationship with Zedka \u2013 not friendship, as the author notes \u2013 and concludes that her words have deep philosophy embedded within them. S She also bonds with Eduard; her piano-playing skills deeply pleasure the young schizophrenic. What suddenly stabs at Veronika is the realization that she has fallen in love with Eduard: primarily because once she is gone, he would be one who would not miss her. Love, hate, curiosity, sexual desires and the wish to live start clouding her. She finds her time at the Villete to be an emotionally enriching one.</p>\n<p>Dr Igor- the doctor in charge of the asylum- has been portrayed as an ambitious psychiatrist, who works hard on his thesis which, he believes, will revolutionise the psychiatric world. He considers \u2018Vitriol\u2019 or Bitterness to be the poison responsible for madness. Bitterness, he believes, poisons a man in a way that he ceases to have the will to either live or to die. He gets a much-awaited chance to test his cure for \u2018detoxification\u2019 when Veronika arrives at the Villete. As the story unfolds, it is revealed at the end that Veronika has actually been cured of all damages to her physical being, and she is healthy as anyone could be. This fact had been hidden from her purposely by the doctor. By means of a drug, he continued to induce in her the symptoms of heart damage in an attempt to eliminate Vitriol.</p>\n<p>He achieves this seemingly impossible task by employing his belief (and the title of his thesis) \u2018an awareness of death encourages us to live more intensely\u2019. The twist in the tale comes when Veronika escapes the asylum with Eduard, without the knowledge that she is healthy and has long to live. Dr Igor finds out about her escape on the very morning when he plans to notify her about her health; yet he relishes the fact that Veronika, unaware that she is fine again, would live each day as a miracle.</p>\n<p>The book makes for an absorbing read. Anyone who wishes to dig in deeper into his own being and is, at the same time, willing to let his thoughts run free would find this book to be an enriching experience. An international bestseller authored by the famed Paulo Coelho and translated from the Portuguese by Margaret Jull Costa. Thus the author forces us to ponder upon the things we all know, and which we should see them with a whole new light.</p>\n<blockquote><p>People never learn anything by being told, they have to find out for themselves.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img title=\"Veronika Decided to Die\" alt=\"Veronika Decided to Die\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailycontributor.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/veronika-decides-to-die.jpg\" height=\"376\" width=\"250\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Veronika Decided to Die</p></div></blockquote>\n", "post_id": 381, "location": false, "date": "07-04-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["mystery", "book review", "Read", "Review", "ebook", "crime", "Fiction", "Stieg Larsson", "Girl who kicked Hornet's Nest", "Book", "books", "crime fiction", "Millenium series", "Reading"], "text": "<p>Yesterday I finished reading Aleph by Paulo Coelho, won&#8217;t recommend to anyone, it&#8217;s not worth reading!</p>\n<p>Started Reading The Girl who kicked the Hornet&#8217;s Nest, by Stieg Larsson&#8230;</p>\n<p>Hopefully, it should turn out to be a masterpiece in crime fiction of 21st Century!</p>\n", "post_id": 394, "location": false, "date": "07-21-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["THE IT CROWD", "it", "Hello IT", "computer", "technol", "it crowd"], "text": "<p>Here&#8217;s my fav quote of the month!</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hello, IT.

The Foxman siblings and their mother are a selective bunch who grow emotionally as they are brought together physically to sit Shiva after their father passes away. This week together is not exactly pain-free for the family, as repressed grudges, emotions, and secrets are slowly exposed. Only after the family licks their old wounds can they begin to heal the new ones left by their father&#8217;s death.\u00a0While each person in\u00a0<em>This Is Where I Leave You</em>\u00a0grapples with death, they are also dealing with their own lives.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">But as tragic as the book is at times,through the searing one liners and\u00a0metaphors, the stuff is hilarious.\u00a0 Between Judd&#8217;s mother&#8217;s calm, humanistic approach to just about everything, his brother Philip&#8217;s promiscuous ways, and sister Wendy&#8217;s snappy straight-talk, the reader will LOL!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">In the end, Judd eventually finds his way through the maze of the past and into the present.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">But somewhere in the middle it is possible that it is not a book as it is easily imaginable that it&#8217;s not a novel but a motion picture.

If you haven\u2019t read part two, read it, don\u2019t let spoilers spoil that for you.</p>\n<p>I loved the trilogy partly because of the \u201cLisabeth Salander\u2019s\u201d character, partly of Mikael Blomkvist(a.k.a Kalle Bastard Blomkvist) , a middle-aged journalist\u00a0 who publishes Expo-like magazine called Millennium.</p>\n<p>Each book in the TRIO is related to her and is titled according to her and the consequences she faces.</p>\n<p>Salander, for me, is one of the fascinating character in modern day literature. She\u2019s a sullen goth girl who is tech-savvy and also a pronounced hacker.</p>\n<p>Because of her good deeds and bad, she kicked the so called \u201cHornet\u2019s nest\u201d.</p>\n<p>Still Stieg Larsson, I consider, one of the best crime fiction writer in the modern century. His, \u201cThe Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\u201d is an especially artful construction with its thriller intrigue. The way a reader meets Blomkvist\u00a0 when his professional reputation has been blotted by a libel verdict against him, and the way he, Blomqvist, and Salander fought back was the thriller-isque.</p>\n<p>But book 3, looks like more of consolation, just give the story a happy-ending, though it was necessary, but the way it was written wasn\u2019t well enough. The only problem I had with this final book of the series that she spends most of her time in hospital and then gets hurried into a courtroom as her trial begins. Larsson gets carried away sometimes. There were some poke holes. It could have been better. But it doesn\u2019t matter in the end, NO BODY\u2019s Perfetct! I had much fun reading this trilogy, and I am sure you will too. I am sad Larsson\u2019s gone, and I hope nobody tries to pamper with the character of Lisabeth Salander.</p>\n<p>ABOUT LARSSON:</p>\n<p><em>Larsson was a Swedish journalist who edited a magazine called Expo, which was devoted to exposing racist and extremist organizations in his nativeland. In his spare time, he worked on a trilogy of crime thrillers, delivering them to his Swedish publisher in 2004. In November of that year, a few months before the first of these novels came out, he died of a heart attack.

As \u00a0soon as I finished reading ONLY TIME WILL TELL, which is the first book in the respective series by the same author, I was excited for the sequel. The sequel do pick up right where &#8216;Only Time will Tell&#8217; left. It is self explanatory that both books should be read in the order they are written and then only, the other characters connection to the protagonist, Harry Clifton, will be understandable for the reader.</p>\n<p>In &#8216;The Sins of the Father&#8217;, which spans the years of World War II, Harry is desperate to escape the revelations that upset his life and prevented his marriage to Emma Barrington, the sister of his best friend, Giles.\u00a0 He finds himself in New York City, having miraculously survived a German torpedo attack, while his family back in England mourns his death.\u00a0 Harry soon learns that it\u2019s not really a good idea to assume the identity of a dead man you\u00a0didn&#8217;t\u00a0know very well, as it likely will bring you more trouble than simply facing your problems head on.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Emma believes Harry is still alive and goes off in search of him, Giles goes off to war, and their despicable father, Hugo, shunned by his family and friends, risks the family business in a quest for more money and power.\u00a0 At the same time, Harry\u2019s mother, Maisie, struggling with grief, throws herself into her work and learns that happiness may actually be possible for a woman who\u2019s had a rough life and never put herself first.</p>\n<p>The drama of the Cliftons and the Barringtons continues at top speed in\u00a0The Sins of the Father.\u00a0 The book reads very quickly and if you are good you might finish in one sitting. \u00a0Archer knows very well how to grabs readers\u2019 attention by plunging them into the action from the first page, shifting frequently between different characters\u2019 points of view, peeling back another layer of the story in nearly every chapter, and knowing exactly when to leave readers dangling in suspense.</p>\n<p>Though in my opinion ending could have been \u00a0better but I guess just for the next release he did get carried away a little. But I will appreciate him that the book is well written and the characters are well developed. It is hard to find that much amount of modern day authors developing there characters so good. But after all he is Jeffrey Archer. Though now there is more excitement for the third volume as a reader.</p>\n<p>I would say go for it, and you won&#8217;t be disappointed, I promise.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amandeepmittal.wordpress.com/2012/12/19/the-sins-of-the-father-a-book-review/jeff/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-589\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-589\" alt=\"jeff\" src=\"https://amandeepmittal.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/jeff.jpg?w=300&#038;h=300\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 588, "location": false, "date": "12-19-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Ian Rankin", "book review", "postaday", "Fiction", "blog", "books", "crime fiction", "amanmittal", "Set in Darkness", "John Rebus", "Reading"], "text": "<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>SET IN DARKNESS</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>by IAN RANKIN</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">When did I first hear about Ian Rankin.

Maybe he was just trying to earn a little extra for he had only one copy, but I am\u00a0thankful\u00a0to him. I still thank him today for making me read well written crime fiction books. Yes, Mr.Rankin know what to write and how, I have read almost half of his John Rebus&#8217; series in past one year and half, and he never gets carried away, never off the mark, the plot would always be good, his protagonist, John Rebus, always satisfying the reader and that&#8217;s what makes you a good crime fiction writer. That&#8217;s what a reader would love to read. That&#8217;s what I love to read. And not only the plot is great, it&#8217;s simple and very imaginable. Mr. Rankin knows the trick of\u00a0immersing\u00a0the reader steadily in the deep criminal world of Edinburgh. Set in Darkness was not only my first book of John rebus but also my only key to enter his world.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><a href=\"http://amandeepmittal.wordpress.com/2012/12/23/set-in-darkness-a-book-review/set-indarknes/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-594\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-594\" alt=\"set indarknes\" src=\"https://amandeepmittal.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/set-indarknes.jpg?w=298&#038;h=475\" width=\"298\" height=\"475\" /></a>The\u00a0inspector Rebus&#8217; series shows\u00a0\u00a0remarkable purview of the darker side to humanity.\u00a0Rebus is a dedicated Scottish policeman, streetwise, methodical and\u00a0persistent. But like all those he encounters, his has demons of his\u00a0own to battle: a failed marriage, loneliness, alcoholism.</p>\n<p>The novel opens with the discovery of a body buried in Queensbury House, an old historic building being renovated to accommodate the Scottish parliament. Without any clues to the identity of the deceased, this case takes a low priority until a second murder occurs on the very same site. Roddy Grieve, a wealthy and ambitious Labour Party candidate for the legislature, is found bludgeoned to death, and Rebus is assigned to assist Derek Linford in this higher profile murder. Linford has ambitions of his own within Scottish<br />\nlaw enforcement; and, as you might suspect, he and Rebus are\u00a0opposite ends of the compass. Tactless, pompous and the golden boy of the police department hierarchy, Linford is placed in charge of the investigation, which he is obviously too inexperienced to handle. Rebus, on the other hand, organizes an efficient team of detectives and begins a methodic search for a motive that would bind these murders together. When the apparent suicide of a homeless man with an amazingly large bank account falls in the lap of his former disciple, Siobahn Clarke, she finds herself partnered\u00a0once again with Rebus.</p>\n<p>The main ideology of the author is to show duality of the city of Edinburgh through Rebus&#8217;s character and perspective:\u00a0a quiet and peaceful city during\u00a0daytime, but a dark and turbulent city during night time. He clearly relates his first two novels\u00a0<em>Knots &amp; Crosses\u00a0</em>and\u00a0<em>Hide &amp; Seek</em>, to\u00a0Robert Louis Stevenson&#8217;s novel <em>The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde\u00a0</em>just to create a\u00a0modernized\u00a0version of the classic.</p>\n<p>Grounded in the traditional method of skillful plotting, Mr.Rankin leads readers in several directions at once. He offers up any number of suspects and \u00a0also tosses in a series of rape cases.</p>\n<p>As if this novel didn&#8217;t have enough twists already, a villain from a previous Rebus novel, reenters the inspector&#8217;s life, jeopardizing the\u00a0dangerous\u00a0investigation. Juggling three cases, appeasing his superiors, protecting Siobahn and watching his own back make <em>Set in Darkness\u00a0</em>electrified with suspense. With Rankin&#8217;s superb characterizations and historic backdrops, this masterful writer takes his place alongside the best in the genre of crime fiction today.</p>\n", "post_id": 593, "location": false, "date": "12-22-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["amanmittal", "justajoke", "aman mittal", "postaday"], "text": "<blockquote><p>CUSTOMER: Do you have a copy of Bella Swan\u2019s favourite book?

The book is\u00a0\u00a0is 380 pages long and is divided into 46 chapters. You will be hooked to the book right from the prologue if you have read the earlier two books of the series. The book focuses on the life of Harry Clifton and people around him during the years 1945 to 1957.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em>The Sins Of The Father</em> ends at the moment where the judge is about to declare who would be inheriting the Barrington title, Harry Clifton or his best friend Giles Barrington after the death of Sir Walter Barrington. This judgement is announced at the beginning and sets the course of Harry Clifton\u2019s unpredictable life.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">As the book progresses, the focus of the story gets shifted to Sebastian Clifton. He plays an important role is defending his uncle Giles\u2019s seat in the house of the Commons. Also, he wins a scholarship to Cambridge in 1957 and gets caught up in a mess and which is where this book ends.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The book is no extraordinary but is a satisfactory. Archer&#8217;s way of swiftly changing the course of story is appreciable, but the book certainly has some points which were\u00a0unnecessary. But then,\u00a0<strong>he&#8217;s the storyteller not me</strong>. And he tells his story gracefully. The book is a fast read.\u00a0Archer knows very well how to grabs readers\u2019 attention by plunging them into the action from the first page, shifting frequently between different characters\u2019 points of view, peeling back another layer of the story in nearly every chapter, and knowing exactly when to leave readers dangling in suspense.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">No doubt Archer is one of the best storyteller in modern days. Though I will hope he releases the next book this year, which would focus\u00a0on the life of Sebastian Clifton, but I am told that I have to wait till 2014.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_645\" style=\"width: 210px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://amandeepmittal.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/jf.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-645\" alt=\"Best Kept Secret\" src=\"https://amandeepmittal.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/jf.jpg?w=200&#038;h=215\" width=\"200\" height=\"215\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Best Kept Secret by Jeffrey Archer</p></div>\n", "post_id": 650, "location": false, "date": "03-29-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["vincent van gogh", "art", "nature", "postaday", "aman mittal blog", "amanmittal", "aman mittal"], "text": "<p>People often brag about Nature.

He observed he had two matchsticks left in the matchbox. No shed and shrewd rain, how in the name of god is he going to light that cigarette? But what you seek is what you get, only you have to make your own way to it. And he stood in front of a glass of a shop where some mannequins were on display inside, wearing wicked hats and fancy dresses. He holds his hands in an oval covering the strike which he was going to make and managed to light the cigarette with both of the matchsticks in one strike. As he took his first puff, he sees a reflection in the glass and then he looked carefully. It was more than the reflection, it was his image with a blurred background of cause of mannequins as the matchsticks were still managing to emit enough light to see. He looked carefully and he saw a\u00a0 man looking old, very old with unshaved facial hair, and the swollen and dry skin as it had been months since a drop of glycerin has been rubbed off his skin. He realized he wore a more wicked hat than those lifeless creatures which were never going to make to life. He said to himself, &#8216;Shall I go back?&#8217;</p>\n<p lang=\"en-IN\">\n<p lang=\"en-IN\">No was the answer in his ears, mechanically ringing like church bells.</p>\n<p lang=\"en-IN\">\n<p lang=\"en-IN\">&#8216;But why?&#8217;</p>\n<p lang=\"en-IN\">\n<p lang=\"en-IN\">He already knew the answer: abandoned.</p>\n<p lang=\"en-IN\">\n<p lang=\"en-IN\">&#8216;Abandoned from what?&#8217;</p>\n<p lang=\"en-IN\">\n<p lang=\"en-IN\">Abandoned from love, shelter, and food. The three things a man needs to survive and live happily.

He knew the sound was not only the matchsticks but also the illusion which made him see the three different keys of happiness.</p>\n<p lang=\"en-IN\">\n<p lang=\"en-IN\">&#8216;It must be my fault as I have always avoided consequences and situations in ignorance, and for my own little pleasures which I have been too fond of. I always wanted to paint, but I never paint one. I had canvas, I had colours, I had the idea. But now it&#8217;s all gone and I am lost on this road which seems less traveled. Misery is my slut or I am hers&#8217;. Which is true, it might be both. And add to the misery, I can&#8217;t even make myself lifeless by a monotonous colour as my life is already faded in a single colour. But it&#8217;s time to change. Its time to leave this harlot here and go with the wind. Through these black clouds soon there will be a beam of sunlight on my face which will bring back all the glycerin on my skin and make it soft as it was soft in my offspring, and take away all the dryness. With morning light I&#8217;ll follow till my destination arrives and my departure from this world of Hades&#8217; be confirmed. My life would be my canvas as I&#8217;ll paint it and fill each and every colour that is in existence of nature.

It was as yellow as it could be but the surface looked as smooth as butter. Made in Victorian fashion, it was obvious the roof top would be either crimson red or dull red in colour but this one was crimson red. The windows were quite French, painted in green as was the interior. How could one see the interior, well the windows were always open at this time of the day. But I could never see any movement up there. Not a single soul. Neighboring that house, designed and structured in the similar fashion was another yellow house. The two only differ in their interior colours. This other one was lavenderish pink from inside. And there was a shop of some kind which I am not able to recall of what it was. If one look far, straight, where he would be dwelling currently, he would see a bridge on which a steam would pass exactly at noon. It was 11:58 a.m. by my watch so I had to wait for two more minutes to see elegant body. Though two minutes were still to be traveled, I could hear the distorting and disturbing sound of the engine and the general noise of the blowing horn. The steam would pass by as a black beauty would. There was some elegance in its blackness too, blowing out the contrasting white smoke. The smoke which came out gaps and one could see the blue sky in between the chunks and that blue sky would make those chunks of smoke appear as some white-gray clouds. There was some smoke in front of the yellow house too. An old man in his gray communist hat was puffing off his cigarette. His cigarette would never went off as his age would be someday. But if one concentrates on his face, it resembled a handsome man in past but now left with poverty, drip and dry skin, face swallowed by pain and his cigarette. As the soigne steam would continue to pass one can see to women coming in one&#8217;s direction and is able to judge they had been married quite along time. Carrying a basket each, one or the other, and talking gibberish. Maybe they are insulting each other&#8217;s husbands, but they would be bored by now. Or maybe they are just gossiping about one thing or the other. The sky is so blue that it makes want to follow it till I find a dark cloud but if the sky is this endlessly blue, I think I&#8217;ll never find a cloud.</p>\n<p>The blue sky, the soigne steam, the French windows , the yellow house, whole image is so picturesque. It is captured in my mind so boldly that it would appear every morning I wake up and would tempt me to go out and have a look of this yellow house. But I wish I could, if it was real.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full;\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://amandeepmittal.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/savedpicture-201351623325.jpg\" /></p>\n", "post_id": 740, "location": false, "date": "05-15-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["fitzgerald", "aman mittal blog", "the great gatsby", "amanmittal", "scott fitzgerald", "aman mittal"], "text": "<p><img class=\"size-full\" alt=\"BOOK OF THE MONTH-JUNE!\" src=\"https://amandeepmittal.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/gatsby.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>THE GREAT GATSBY by Scott Fitzgearld</p>\n", "post_id": 754, "location": false, "date": "06-02-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["literature", "Reading", "book review", "jay gatsby", "Review", "postaday", "fitzgerald", "blog", "aman mittal blog", "Amandeep Mittal", "the great gatsby", "aman mittal"], "text": "<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em><a href=\"http://amandeepmittal.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/g.gif\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image alignleft\" id=\"i-815\" alt=\"The Great Gastby\" src=\"https://amandeepmittal.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/g.gif?w=301&#038;h=418\" width=\"301\" height=\"418\" /></a></em><em>\u00a0 \u00a0 Review by Aman Mittal</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>THE GREAT GATSBY</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em>by\u00a0<strong>F.Scott Fitzgerald</strong></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I read the book over the last weekend and spent quite a time as it length would not suggest. Some would say its a tragic love story with crime and corrupted minds. But I say its a very close resemblance to Fitzgerald&#8217;s own life, especially his struggle for his own love. That is the main theme. The story starts with Nick Carraway&#8217;s narration when he visits his cousin, Daisy.\u00a0Nick, is an exceptionally mild person to the point of being dull. But through this narration framed in the thoughts of an exceedingly dull person Fitzgerald creates characters and lays out scenes that are vivid and bright and engaging.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">By coincidence or by luck, Jay Gatsby, the lavish millionaire who throws extravagant\u00a0parties to celebrate his wealth, is the neighbor of Nick.\u00a0The story intertwines with Nick\u2019s cousin Daisy Buchanan who is Gatsby\u2019s long lost first love and still the object of his desire, Daisy\u2019s husband Tom Buchanan who is having an affair with Myrtle Wilson.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">It&#8217;s a mild story and the gripping depends all on the reader mind. With insignificant complexity the plot is an impressive display of analysis through rhetoric.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">There are some similarities between the author Fitzgerald and the character Gatsby. Both had the opportunities to attend world&#8217;s most prestigious universities, Princeton and Oxford, but failed to graduate either of them. Both also attended the army. These are some insignificant similarities, though.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">But the analogousness between them is the love of their lives. Both of them fell in love being young and neither of them could provide what their ladies, Zelda and Daisy, wanted. Both of these ladies were highly interested in money, and terminated their relationships. In Gatsby&#8217;s case, Daisy promised to wait but instead dated many men and married Tom Buchanan. In Scott&#8217;s case, he was engaged to Zelda and he went to New York seeking fortune but his plans took longer than expected. Thus, Zelda broke their engagement. It was not until the first book which made him rich enough to marry Zelda.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Both Daisy and Zelda resemble each other. They both were unloyal to their respective lovers. Gatsby&#8217;s struggle to get back his love fully resembles the struggle Scott might have experienced.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">But as story needs to have an ending, Fitzgerald wrote down one possibility of his own love life could have ended or in other words the ending.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I quite like the story and the way it is written. It is, no doubt, one of the American Classics.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\u201cIn his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars.&#8221;</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "post_id": 761, "location": false, "date": "06-03-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["walter isaacson", "Reading", "ebook", "steve jobs", "books", "aman mittal blog", "Amandeep Mittal", "amanmittal", "aman mittal"], "text": "<p><img class=\"size-full\" alt=\"iBUY-STEVE JOBS\" src=\"https://amandeepmittal.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/wp_001247.jpg\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong><em>Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson</em></strong></p>\n", "post_id": 820, "location": false, "date": "06-06-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Writer", "Writing", "Man and Superman", "Book", "amanmittal", "Reading", "ebooks", "blog", "The Devil's Disciple", "Read", "George Bernard Shaw", "write", "Candida", "aman mittal", "literature", "ebook", "Caesar and Cleopatra", "Fiction", "postaday", "Pygmalion", "books", "aman mittal blog", "Amandeep Mittal"], "text": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_859\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"http://amandeepmittal.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/gb-shw.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-859  \" alt=\"G B Shaw\" src=\"https://amandeepmittal.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/gb-shw.jpg?w=250&#038;h=163\" width=\"250\" height=\"163\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">G.

The concept of sightseeing of readers might be creepy to some, but it&#8217;s an idea and curiosity of the author to look around and see what others are reading. Imagine yourself, and tell me you would like to do that too. The book is a collection micro-fictions and brief descriptions of people the author has glanced reading in public. Each story in its brevity is able to capture a scene, a character, and her feelings in a remarkably short space. You might be disappointed as it goes on giving the descriptions, but it&#8217;s a very good way to indulge yourself in new books. You can try new books by snooping yourself. The range of featured books is large and fascinating. Some of them, you might have read. I picked this neat little book as a random, and I guess I am satisfied with the concept of the book.

The hero acts out of unselfish idealism. Otherwise all other characters are significant and make the play<em> a melodrama with a difference</em>. The court-martial scene is one of the funniest scene of its kind in dramatic literature. It revolves around a General whose witty sarcasm is classy and sophisticatedly pleasing.

It&#8217;s been six months since the year started, since those words I started to read written by various authors. Six months time is long and but not enough to read. Still I managed to read thirty one books (till the last month, and yes I keep a log). So far, it has been a great reading year for me and thus I manage to compile a list of my top ten books I have read so far.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong></strong><strong>1. THE GREAT GATSBY</strong>\u00a0<em>BY SCOTT FITZGERALD<br />\n</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I was flattered by the book and the philosophy behind it by Fitzgerald. How this book can be closely related to his private life and the time of 1920s is by reading the book. You might realize after reading it that you have not fallen in love with it or any of it&#8217;s characters. But that&#8217;s the beauty of it. That what resembles the lavish 1920s. It&#8217;s highly recommended by me.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>2. NAMING OF THE DEAD</strong>\u00a0<em>BY IAN RANKIN</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Ian Rankin is one of the most prolific crime fiction writer of 21st century. And this one is his one of the masterpieces&#8217;. He knows what to write. His characters know how to perform. He conveys the atmosphere to perfection.\u00a0It was quite a page turning for me. This is the sixteenth novel of <em>John Rebus</em> series.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong></strong><strong>3. METAMORPHOSIS\u00a0</strong><em>BY FRANZ KAFKA</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">It always bugs me why this story of Kafka is included in every literature course everywhere in the world. Well after reading it, I got my answer. Kafka displays a new concept by this story. A man to a bug, it was my first experience with German literature and proved to be wonderful in the end. Intense of the story is quite strong.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>4. 1984\u00a0</strong><em>BY GEORGE ORWELL</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\u00a0After reading this, I realized this book is a conception of what reality is becoming. And thus, it is turning out to be true. Orwell wrote it after the\u00a0World War II<em>\u00a0</em>and till today I feel this book is applicable to our reality. The philosophy behind this book is intensive. But due it&#8217;s length, I got a bit bored.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>5. THE DEVIL&#8217;S DISCIPLE\u00a0</strong><em>BY GEORGE BERNARD SHAW</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\u00a0Bernard Shaw, as he liked himself to be called, is a master of witty plays. And I read <em>Pygmalion</em> and <em>Devil&#8217;s Disciple\u00a0</em>at the same time but the two are not comparable.\u00a0<em>Pygmalion\u00a0</em>is a straight set win while\u00a0<em>Devil&#8217;s Disciple\u00a0</em>is totally witty. I enjoyed Shaw&#8217;s inscription.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>6. THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA\u00a0</strong><em>BY ERNEST HEMINGWAY</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">This novella is one of the major works produced by Hemingway. It is one of his famous works but I did not feel why. In the starting I found difficult to indulge myself but when the story goes on, my was indulging deep and down in the sea with the old man. It&#8217;s a short read, and certainly a <em>Pulitzer Prize</em> winner.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>7. INFERNO</strong> <em>BY DAN BROWN</em><strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\u00a0The fifth addition to Robert Langdon&#8217;s Saga. <em>Angels and Demons\u00a0</em>was the first book I read written by Dan Brown. It&#8217;s still his best work. <em>Inferno</em>, is a fast read, which was not expected by me as Brown&#8217;s earlier works worked at normal pace. When it came out I was so excited as I had read pre-reviews about it&#8217;s relation to <em>Dante</em>. I started reading when it was\u00a0five hours after it\u00a0launched. And read it in tow sittings. I can say I was not impressed by this book as I was by\u00a0<em>Angels and Demons.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>8. </strong><strong>DAISY MILLER\u00a0</strong><em>BY HENRY JAMES</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">It was my first of something I read written by Henry James. I had waited for it quite long, and made sure something of Henry James&#8217; was on my reading list of this year. It is a novella and just a novella. I would love to read more written by him.</p>\n<p><strong>9. THE DARK ROAD\u00a0</strong><em>BY MA JIAN</em></p>\n<p>I am glad I read this book. Firstly, I wanted to try a new author this year, and unknown, at least for me. And Ma was one of them. Secondly, it was whole new experience of words for me, the plot, consequence, the atmosphere as the book is setup in China. Ma Jian is the author I am keen to read more and I am recommending this book toe everyone, but it&#8217;s a bit too long.</p>\n<p><strong>10. BEST KEPT SECRET\u00a0</strong><em>BY JEFFREY ARCHER</em></p>\n<p>I was recommend to him by a friend of mine a few years back. Then, I read only book but I started reading his<em> Clifton Chronicles</em> lately, and this one was the third in the series. Though it was the first book, <em>Only time will tell\u00a0</em>which made get myself indulged in this series, I am waiting for the fourth one.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With half of the 2013 being a good for reading, I am excited for the other half. I am looking forward to read so many books and in mood of trying some new authors as well.</p>\n<p><strong><strong>What\u00a0have been\u00a0your favourite reads so far in

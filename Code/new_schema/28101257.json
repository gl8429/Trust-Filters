Yes, it was quite spontaneous, but that is what happens when you put a group of musical theatre enthusiasts together. And besides, who says there can&#8217;t be Christmas in July? After we exhausted all the Christmas songs we could remember, we transitioned into singing the National Anthem, which we decided was an appropriate choice, considering our country&#8217;s day of independence is only\u00a0 a couple of days away. While crossing through a cross walk, a few people who heard us from a distance had started to sing along, and gave us a nod of approval as our groups passed each other. That made me smile, and I couldn&#8217;t help but\u00a0 laughed as well.\u00a0 Music, friends, spontaneity, and laughter&#8230;I couldn&#8217;t have asked for a more delightful summer night.</p>\n", "post_id": 104, "location": false, "date": "07-03-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["wardrobe", "messy room", "style", "clothing"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://1emilyjo.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/messy_closet_100710_m1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-41 alignright\" title=\"messy_closet_100710_m\" src=\"https://1emilyjo.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/messy_closet_100710_m1.jpg?w=160&#038;h=223\" alt=\"\" width=\"160\" height=\"223\" /></a><a href=\"http://1emilyjo.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/charity-pic.jpg\"><br />\n</a>You walk into my room.

You think, \u201cMan, what a disaster!\u201d</p>\n<p>But wait! Before you ostracize me for my sloppy behaviors, let me say a word in defense. <em>Style</em>. Yes, that&#8217;s right, <em>style</em>.</p>\n<p>You see, the wardrobe is picky and loves to engage in fashion fights.</p>\n<p>Don\u2019t believe me? Check out this typical everyday scenario:</p>\n<p>Getting ready for the day, you survey your clothing options and pull out a bouncing summer dress. Before you know it, the wardrobe rejects your choice and throws jeans and a tank top at you. Where does your summer dress end up? On the floor. Irritated, you fling the jeans and tank top in the air, and yank out a skirt and blouse. The wardrobe fumes, and dumps four\u00a0rounds of shirts in your direction until you finally choose a new one. You are both satisfied for a moment.</p>\n<p>Now the next battle&#8230;shoes. You decide on flats, the wardrobe decides heels. You end up wearing flip-flops, a smug gesture to defy the wardrobe and assert your superiority.</p>\n<p>The fight continues with a battle over each accessory until finally you&#8217;ve had enough. You abandon the wardrobe and step over the threshold of your room into the hallway.\u00a0Freedom. It feels like lemonade on a sizzling summer day. You take one more glance back into the battle zone and see the clusters of clothes sprinkled everywhere. You shut the door. The mess vanishes. You continue forward, eager to face the day with\u2026 what else? <em>Style</em>!</p>\n", "post_id": 34, "location": false, "date": "10-20-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["loogie hawking", "mucus", "clean sidewalks", "ninjas"], "text": "<p><em></em>It\u2019s a lovely day.

They have been left to suffocate in boxes of unused cards that will eventually be tossed into garbage cans. Last month, I got rid of several piles of thank you cards thinking, \u201cWhen am I ever going to use all these?\u201d Over the past year, I\u2019ve written less than a dozen thank you notes and received about the same.</p>\n<p>When I was a kid, writing a thank you letter was a chore. After my birthday or Christmas, I\u2019d come up with a fill in the blank formula to help speed through my list of people I needed to thank. Usually it went something like this:</p>\n<p><em>Dear___,</em></p>\n<p><em>Thank you so much for the ___! I really like it. It was great having you at my party.</em></p>\n<p><em>Hope to see you soon!</em></p>\n<p><em>Love,</em></p>\n<p><em>Me</em></p>\n<p>As I grew older, similar notes arrived in the mail and I started growing weary of the \u201cformula\u201d thank you note. What I saw when I opened these letters was someone saying, \u201cI am writing this thank you note because I am obligated to thank you, but I have no interest in investing any personal touch and just want to cross your name off my list.\u201d</p>\n<p>I came to the realization that there is no point in sending a thank you that doesn\u2019t have meaning. Unless it is written from a heart of appreciation, I would rather not receive one at all.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s been a goal of mine lately to write the kind of thank you note I would like to receive.

This happens to me constantly and especially in situations where a million names are shooting at me as fast as pin balls. I don\u2019t know how many times I\u2019ve heard, \u201cOh, I\u2019m not good with names.\u201d I quickly discovered if you want to be good at the name game, you have to spend time practicing and improving your skills.</p>\n<p>One time after meeting this guy, he replied, \u201cSorry, I\u2019m probably not going to remember your name.\u201d Basically he was saying was that he wasn\u2019t that interested in me or else he would have made an effort to remember my name. When I meet someone, I want them to feel that they are worth my time. I believe a name is an essential part of a person\u2019s identity and a good way to recognize someone is to start with their name. When someone remembers my name, it makes me feel important and it validates our connection.</p>\n<p>Want to join me honing your name skills? Here are some of the strategies that have helped me remember names.</p>\n<p>-Focus: Try and get a clear picture of the person\u2019s name in your head and link it with a snap shot of their physical appearance.</p>\n<p>-Repetition: If you say a person\u2019s name at least five times you are less likely to forget it. Repeat it back, say it in your head a couple of times, use it in conversation, and use it when departing.</p>\n<p>- Store: File the name in your brain with a few details. For example, if the person was wearing a red dress, then you might store the name as \u201cNancy red dress,\u201d or if the person laughed a lot, \u201cgiggley Suzie\u201d or if they mentioned their job, \u201cbarista Sam.\u201d</p>\n<p>-Record: So you remember the person\u2019s name for the evening, but will you remember it the next time you see them? Spend a few minutes writing down the name with a short description. This way in days, weeks, months later, you can review the details and will be more likely to remember that person when you see them again.</p>\n<p>\u201cA name pronounced is the recognition of the individual to whom it belongs. He who can pronounce my name aright, he can call me, and is entitled to my love and service.\u201d &#8211; Henry David Thoreau</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://1emilyjo.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/name.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-76\" title=\"name\" src=\"https://1emilyjo.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/name.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "post_id": 75, "location": false, "date": "11-24-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["power of words", "think before speaking", "words"], "text": "<p>If someone wanted to become the richest person in the world, all they would need to do was invent the Word Eraser.

No worries! Just whip out your Word Eraser and it will fix everything.</p>\n<p>However ideal this invention would be, it doesn\u2019t exist and we are left to face this frustrating reality: You can never retract words once they\u2019ve left your mouth.</p>\n<p>When I was in junior high, a few boys commented negatively on my appearance.

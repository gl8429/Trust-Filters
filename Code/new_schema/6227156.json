Book #1 of the Women of the Otherworld series. It may get classified as &#8220;fluff&#8221; or &#8220;paranormal romance&#8221; but I disagree. I classify it as &#8220;Urban Fantasy&#8221;. Yes, there&#8217;s romance, but jesus h. christ just because the main character is female and she gets some tail (literally, she&#8217;s a werewolf) does not make it chick lit or fluff or a romance book. For fuck&#8217;s sake.<br />\nRight. Canadian werewolf Elena (so alternatively polite and ragey) has to make the choice between Pack life or pretending to be something she&#8217;s not. The <a href=\"http://www.kelleyarmstrong.com/books/\">rest of the series is worth a read too</a> (though I&#8217;m not quite finished; I&#8217;ve read up to <em>No Humans Involved</em> and there&#8217;s a whole bunch after that, but I plan on catching up at some point).</li>\n<li><em>Glenraven</em>, by Marion Zimmer Bradley and Holly Lisle. <a href=\"http://katjevanloon.com/30-in-30-day-04-in-which-im-late-with-the-post-but-feck-off-its-my-birthday-p-also-i-talk-about-glenraven/\">I&#8217;ve blogged about this book before and how much I love it</a>, and apparently I have read something by Holly Lisle &#8212; I just keep forgetting because my brain has classified <em>Glenraven</em> as an MZB book. My bad. (Apologies to Holly Lisle.) Anyway, really good book. Adventure, strange new worlds, romance, magic, best friends&#8230;you can&#8217;t go wrong, really.</li>\n<li><em>Rhapsody: Child of Blood</em>, by Elizabeth Haydon.\u00a0 The first in what is supposed to be an 8-book series, though only 6 books are out at this point (no word on the 7th, either, which is depressing). Regardless, it&#8217;s worth it to read at least the first trilogy (<em>Rhapsody</em>, <em>Prophecy</em>, and <em>Destiny</em>), if not the bridge (<em>Requiem for the Sun</em> and <em>Elegy for a Lost Star</em>) and the first of the final trilogy (<em>The Assassin King</em>). It&#8217;s not that the bridge and sixth book aren&#8217;t good &#8212; they are, and that&#8217;s the problem. There are two more books coming out and they leave you hanging. But you can read the first trilogy by itself and be satisfied; I was until the other books came out.</li>\n<li><em>Stormqueen!</em> by Marion Zimmer Bradley. A standalone novel in the Darkover series, set during the Ages of Chaos. Dorilys Aldaran is the stormqueen, able to call forth devastating lightning and storms from a small age. MZB was a very talented writer though I think her Darkover works get overlooked in favor of The Mists of Avalon. Both are excellent, but one gets more press. So here I am giving Darkover some press.</li>\n<li><em>Through Wolf&#8217;s Eyes</em>, by Jane Lindskold. This entire series is very good. Firekeeper is a different sort of heroine and Lindskold&#8217;s knowledge of wolves is exemplary. The series is done and I recommend checking it out: 1) <em>Through Wolf&#8217;s Eyes</em>, 2) <em>Wolf&#8217;s Head, Wolf&#8217;s Heart</em>, 3) <em>The Dragon of Despair</em>, 4) <em>Wolf Captured</em>, 5) <em>Wolf Hunting</em>, 6) <em>Wolf&#8217;s Blood</em>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "post_id": 1016, "location": false, "date": "08-26-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["plus-sized", "voluptuous", "fat-positivity", "overweight", "fat", "pejoratives", "curvy", "reclaiming words", "fat acceptance"], "text": "<div style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:La_monstrua_desnuda_%281680%29%2C_de_Juan_Carre%C3%B1o_de_Miranda..jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"zemanta-img-inserted\" title=\"Juan Carre\u00f1o de Miranda\u200e's \" alt=\"Juan Carre\u00f1o de Miranda\u200e's \" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/La_monstrua_desnuda_%281680%29%2C_de_Juan_Carre%C3%B1o_de_Miranda..jpg/300px-La_monstrua_desnuda_%281680%29%2C_de_Juan_Carre%C3%B1o_de_Miranda..jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"447\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image via Wikipedia</p></div>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve been paying attention the past several years, you&#8217;ll know we have an &#8220;obesity epidemic&#8221; on our hands.</p>\n<p>Well, that&#8217;s what <em>they</em> like to call it. I don&#8217;t, because it makes it seem like we fat people are the disease. The way we get treated by most people, you&#8217;d think we were.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t mind the descriptor &#8220;fat&#8221;. In fact I embrace it. It&#8217;s completely devoid of any negative or positive denotation &#8212; all it means is that I have an abundance of <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Adipose tissue\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipose_tissue\" rel=\"wikipedia\">adipose tissue</a> on my frame. That&#8217;s it. Simple, to the point, accurate. <strong>I am fat</strong>.</p>\n<p>However, the <em>connotations</em> associated with the word &#8212; well, that&#8217;s another story. Here&#8217;s the skinny (pardon the pun) on denotation vs. connotation, in case you&#8217;re not aware: <strong>denotation</strong> is what a word <strong>actually means</strong>. <strong>Connotation</strong> is what <strong>people think it means</strong>. And because what people think as a whole shapes our society and thus, our language, <em>connotation will quickly become denotation.</em></p>\n<p>That&#8217;s why pejorative words are pejorative. They get used as an insult long enough and soon that&#8217;s all they are, regardless the actual denotations of the words themselves.</p>\n<p>Connotations are completely valid ways of understanding the definitions of words &#8212; <em>words mean things</em>, and they don&#8217;t exist in a vacuum, separate from society. However, as I am a member of certain groups that are constantly marginalized and referred to in pejorative ways, I&#8217;m very invested in the idea of reclaiming pejorative words to remove the negative connotations.</p>\n<p>So, when I say &#8220;I am fat&#8221; I realize that there are a ton of negative connotations surrounding that simple, three-letter word: stupid. Lazy. Gluttonous. Ill. Ugly. Jolly. Nice hair. Great personality.</p>\n<p>Ok, so the last three are not universally considered negative things &#8212; but believe me, when they&#8217;re all people know you for (and it&#8217;s obvious they don&#8217;t know you very well if they think you&#8217;re jolly): definitely gets negative, very quickly.</p>\n<p>Which is why when I say &#8220;I am fat&#8221; and people respond with &#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t be so <em>hard</em> on yourself!&#8221; I ask them if they would say the same thing if I said, for example, &#8220;I am Dutch&#8221; or &#8220;I am well-read.&#8221; The first thing only means I have an abundance of adipose tissue, the second and third respectively denote my heritage and the fact that I read a lot. They are all simple descriptors.</p>\n<p>This usually stumps people. They ask why I can&#8217;t use a &#8220;nicer&#8221; euphemism for fat, like &#8220;bigger&#8221; or &#8220;plus-sized&#8221; or &#8220;overweight&#8221; or &#8220;curvy&#8221; or &#8220;voluptuous.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For starters, here&#8217;s the definition of &#8220;voluptuous&#8221;.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<div>\n<h2>vo\u00b7lup\u00b7tu\u00b7ous</h2>\n<p>[vuh-luhp-choo-uh<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sp.dictionary.com/dictstatic/dictionary/graphics/luna/thinsp.png\" border=\"0\" />s]</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>adjective</p>\n<div>1. full of, characterized by, or ministering to indulgence in luxury, pleasure, and sensuous enjoyment: a voluptuous life.</div>\n<div>2. derived from gratification of the senses: voluptuous pleasure.</div>\n<div>3. directed toward or concerned with sensuous enjoyment or sensual pleasure: voluptuous desires.</div>\n<div>4. sensuously pleasing or delightful: voluptuous beauty.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>Yeah, ok, I&#8217;m not seeing anything in there about size. Everything to do with the word voluptuous has to do with sensual pleasures, enjoyment, desire, luxury&#8230;so if you want to use voluptuous <em>only</em> as an euphemism for fat, you are basically saying that all fat people are hedonists (and thus, why they&#8217;re fat &#8212; bastards can&#8217;t stop eating, right?).</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not going to argue that personally; I&#8217;m a total hedonist. But painting us all with such a large brush stroke? Rude, to say the least. (Especially to those of us who have eating disorders. Bet you didn&#8217;t know this, but it&#8217;s possible to be fat and have anorexia. I know &#8212; I&#8217;ve been there.)</p>\n<p>Next &#8212; &#8220;curvy&#8221;. This is something women should want to attain, especially fat women &#8212; because it means we&#8217;re not fat anymore, and what&#8217;s worse than being fat? (Apparently NOTHING.) So, again, curvy does not denote size &#8212; it denotes shape. A shape that can be held by slender and fat people &#8212; Katee Sackhoff is curvy and I wouldn&#8217;t say she&#8217;s fat. Unless she wants to call herself fat; I&#8217;m not going to say she&#8217;s not &#8220;fat enough to join the club&#8221;. (There&#8217;s a nasty history of that and it&#8217;s bodysnarking, which I won&#8217;t do.) I&#8217;m sure there are people out there who would bodysnark her because she&#8217;s larger than a size 8. (I have no idea what her size is. I&#8217;m guessing a 12 or 14.)</p>\n<p>However, in our cultural paradigm, curvy really only means one thing &#8212; that you have curves in all the right places, ie your tits and your ass. You shouldn&#8217;t have stomach at all as a curve &#8212; it should be flat. Big tits, a round ass, slender hips and stomach and thighs &#8212; that&#8217;s what &#8220;curvy&#8221; means to the general population.</p>\n<p>And it&#8217;s a fracking lie. I have curves &#8211; not only do they consist of my tits and ass but they also consist of my belly, hips, haunches, thighs, calves, upper arms, and neck fat. Still curvy, that. Just the &#8220;bad curvy&#8221;. (Or &#8220;deathfat,&#8221; as it&#8217;s sometimes referred to.)</p>\n<p>So, ok, let&#8217;s get to the last three of the &#8220;nice&#8221; euphemisms for our simple three-letter descriptor: bigger. Plus-sized. Overweight.</p>\n<p>Do you see a theme with these words? A clue as to why they might be the biggest problem of all?</p>\n<p>Big-<strong>ger</strong>. <strong>Plus</strong>-sized. <strong>Over</strong>weight. They all dictate that there is an ideal size, an ideal weight, that we should all strive to be &#8212; and if we&#8217;re <em>not</em> 150 pounds, or a size 10, or 5&#8217;5&#8221;, then we&#8217;re overweight, plus-sized, bigger. The key part here is that we don&#8217;t get to set that ideal weight for ourselves &#8212; an external force does so and <em>denies us our agenc</em>y.</p>\n<p>Look, <strong>if I say I&#8217;m overweight</strong> &#8212; that means I want to lose some weight, that I have set a weight I wish to be at and I&#8217;m over that weight right now. That is completely different from someone saying &#8220;You&#8217;re overweight,&#8221; or &#8220;She&#8217;s a bigger girl,&#8221; or &#8220;The plus-size is right over here, and I hope you like big shoulder-pads, sequins, and leopard print because you&#8217;ll never find anything else.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I do not like it when people try to erase my agency. Using words like overweight &#8212; &#8220;nicer&#8221; words than that nasty &#8220;fat&#8221; &#8212; does just that.</p>\n<p>You can call me voluptuous and curvy, so long as you say &#8220;and fat&#8221; as well. Otherwise you&#8217;re leaving out a descriptor that&#8217;s sort of important to the whole picture.</p>\n<p><em>Do not</em> call me overweight, plus-sized, or bigger. Those are the worst pejoratives you could use, because by doing so you are telling me that I do not live up to your standards, that I am too fat to be breathing your precious oxygen, that there is a weight I <em>should be</em> and <strong>you</strong> have set that weight as lord and master of the universe. That is an attitude I will not take from <em>anyone</em>.</p>\n<p>Words mean things. Sometimes, they don&#8217;t always mean what you think. So, think hard next time you call someone overweight or bigger. They might prefer something else.</p>\n<p>As always, if you&#8217;re not sure &#8212; <em>the best thing to do is ask</em>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>A small addendum: I was reminded of another nicer euphemism for fat while reading this to my partner. &#8220;Rubenesque.&#8221; My feelings on this word are mixed; as the definition specifically denotes &#8220;referring to works of the painter Rubens&#8221; OR &#8220;a plump and <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">pleasing</span> figure&#8221;, it could either be a simple descriptor (body by Rubens) or it could be a cloaked way of saying &#8220;You&#8217;re one of the <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">good</span> fat people, not one of those hideous deathfatties.&#8221; </em></p>\n<p><em>So in the case of the word &#8220;Rubenesque,&#8221; intent would seem to matter quite a bit &#8212; and we all know <a href=\"http://genderbitch.wordpress.com/2010/01/23/intent-its-fucking-magic/\">intent is fucking magic</a>, don&#8217;t we? Seriously though, I&#8217;m really not sure how to feel on this one. If it&#8217;s coming from an Art History major I probably wouldn&#8217;t mind, but then again I think an Art History major would see that I don&#8217;t actually look like the women in Rubens&#8217; paintings.

He was only 61.</p>\n<p>I say <em>only 61</em> because 61 is young. To me, at least &#8212; both my parents are older than 61 and I&#8217;m only 25. One of them has had cancer and beat it already. I live terrified that it&#8217;ll come back and take her from me.</p>\n<p>So, Jack Layton is dead. What does that mean for Canada? Canadians, on the whole, don&#8217;t get as worked up politically as Americans do. For a long time I&#8217;ve thought this a good thing, as there are fewer chances for us to look like idiots on the world stage. (No offense intended to my Yankee brethren, but it&#8217;s true.)</p>\n<p>However, now I find my thoughts turning. I wonder if we look like bigger idiots for <em>not</em> getting worked up &#8212; especially when there are so many things wrong with our country. (Harper being the main one.)</p>\n<p>Today there&#8217;s been a massive outpouring of love from Canadians across the political spectrum towards Layton&#8217;s family &#8212; most people agree that, regardless where their own votes went, Layton was a force for good in Canadian politics.</p>\n<p>What if we could put that same energy towards our politics? Towards getting involved? Towards being activists?</p>\n<p>I know one of the main reasons I burnt out as an activist in the States was the apathy that surrounded me. Apathy sucks away hope, like a leech on your heart. When I lived in the States, I was very outspoken, politically. My peers were not. Eventually I couldn&#8217;t handle it anymore &#8212; I didn&#8217;t have the energy to go on because it seemed pointless when no one else my age seemed to care. How can one person change the world?</p>\n<p>I know the tide has been turning in Canada with regards to political energy and investment &#8212; especially among young people &#8212; towards us being more interested, more involved, more energetic. <strong>This is a good thing.</strong> We cannot let the death of Jack extinguish our hope for the future &#8212; we must listen to the words he gives us in <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/story/2011/08/22/pol-layton-last-letter.html\">his last letter</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>My friends, love is better than anger. Hope is better than fear. Optimism is better than despair. So let us be loving, hopeful and optimistic. And we\u2019ll change the world.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Layton was one of the good guys. I may not personally identify as NDP, but I voted that way several times. I believed he could and would lead us to a better future.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re half-way there. Let&#8217;s not let his death put out our fires. Let us honor him by continuing to get riled up, by continuing to be political, by continuing to be activists, by taking charge and changing our future.</p>\n<p>It is <em>our future</em>, as young Canadians. We need to make it something we want to live in. No one else is going to do it for us.</p>\n<p>Rest in peace, Jack. Thank you for everything you&#8217;ve done for us. We won&#8217;t let the fire die.

Moving, in our North American society, is generally more of a Mystery the first time one goes through it on one&#8217;s own &#8212; I&#8217;m speaking of the &#8220;moving out of your parents&#8217; house for the first time&#8221; move, not any ones you may have done as a family in your youth. (Those Mysteries are different and have less universal meaning attached.)</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve moved several times at this point &#8211; I first moved out of the house when I was 18, and have lived on my own more or less steadily since (minus a few moves back to Mom&#8217;s place to save money). This current move is another one back to my mother, because now that I am out of school until January at least, I am not on loans until then either &#8212; and I cannot afford the rent at my beautiful one-bedroom basement suite.</p>\n<p>I also cannot afford to keep all my stuff. This is where the lessons lie for this move, where the new Mystery is. For years I have held onto <em>things</em>, loathe to get rid of them, because I have lacked any sense of security in my surroundings for too long. <em>Stuff</em> means <em>security</em> to my animal and non-rational brain. Rationally I can see it&#8217;s quite the opposite, but regardless what I can logically accept with the part of my brain not driven by fear, I cannot force myself to comply lest panic sets in. (Oh, the joys of having an anxiety disorder.)</p>\n<p>However, things have changed. With graduation (another Mystery) from my University, I have entered another stage of my life (never mind I may be returning to school in a few months &#8212; the transition has already set in). On top of that, I have felt quite safe for 8 months now &#8212; living on my own has done wonders for the feeling of security in my life, because there&#8217;s no one around to <em>mess with my stuff, my space</em>. While I still may be friends with a few of my roommates, the fact remains that while they were roommates they were <em>intruders in my den</em>. My animal brain reacts to the presence of roommates with instant fight or flight response. Not conducive to healthy living, for them <em>or</em> me.</p>\n<p>Eight months of being able to relax in my surroundings and fully claim them as mine, <em>my den</em>, has &#8212; if not <em>eliminated</em> &#8212; greatly <em>reduced</em> my attachment to stuff.</p>\n<p>So begins the great inventory of things, and several garage sales coming up in September. In two months I will vacate my haven here, and start the New Year* in my mother&#8217;s house (just in time to start NaNoWriMo, too &#8212; it&#8217;ll be easier to do so without the stress of finding rent money hanging over my head). I will remake myself in portability, and come my time to move to Vancouver (which will either be January, if I get into Langara, or later if I don&#8217;t), I will hopefully be able to within a week &#8212; instead of the several months it usually takes me.</p>\n<p><strong>What are your experiences with the Mystery of moving?

Just because it&#8217;s fluffy does not make it &#8220;chick lit&#8221;. Just because it appeals to women does not relegate it to this oft-overlooked, oft-disparaged corner of the literature world.</p>\n<p>The truth is it appeals to men as well. The truth is it may be fluffy, but that doesn&#8217;t mean it doesn&#8217;t hold some deep truths in it. That doesn&#8217;t mean it can&#8217;t speak to someone on a deeper level.</p>\n<p>Every time you call it <em>chick lit</em>, you are telling a little boy who likes to play with make-up and dolls that he&#8217;s less of a person. Every time you call it chick lit, you are telling women their issues don&#8217;t matter and will never be taken seriously in the &#8220;real world&#8221;, ie the world of <em>men&#8217;s literature</em>. Every time you call it chick lit you are making the enjoyment of it a <em>guilty pleasure</em>, a sin that shouldn&#8217;t be committed by the intellectual elite. It&#8217;s misogynistic and ableist.</p>\n<p>I have a copy of <em>The Undomestic Goddess</em> by Sophie Kinsella. I thought it was a great book and I&#8217;m not ashamed of liking it. I look forward to reading some of her other works. It is classified as chick lit. Why? Because the main character is a woman who leaves her job and discovers her true self in a simpler life style? Because there&#8217;s a romance with a hot gardener? Because she <em>becomes a stronger person by the end of the book and stands up for herself and her new life</em>?*</p>\n<p>Oh, no, we can&#8217;t have those pesky womenfolk feeling better about themselves. Can&#8217;t have them taking strength from literature. Better name those types of books as &#8220;chick lit&#8221;, better genre-ize them so they&#8217;re not<em> real literature</em>, which of course involves hunting and rape and men referring to an abortion as just &#8220;letting a little air in&#8221;. Otherwise women might think their voices matter, might think their issues matter, might take matters into their own hands, get fed up, and start a revolution. We certainly can&#8217;t have that. What a tragedy.</p>\n<p>What a tragedy, indeed.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a tragedy that books by women get pushed aside because they&#8217;re by women. It&#8217;s a tragedy that women<em> still use initials as pen names</em> so people won&#8217;t pass over their works, and that they are <em>still advised</em> to do so. It&#8217;s a tragedy that those of us who do not use initials have to work twice as hard to get our work looked at, or have to submit to genre-fication in order to get published.</p>\n<p><em>The Undomestic Goddess</em> is <em>mainstream</em> literature. By which I mean it&#8217;s set in the here and now and deals with modern-day characters, and there are no fantastical or science-fiction-y elements to it.</p>\n<p>Mainstream literature is <em>real fucking literature</em>, regardless the gender of the main character or the author.</p>\n<p>Writing has been a boys&#8217; club for far too long. It&#8217;s time for that to change, and it&#8217;s not going to unless we <em>stop</em> saying &#8220;chick lit&#8221;.</p>\n<hr />\n<h6>*Unless it&#8217;s by D.H.

Writers from across the country and the world come to talk about their works, the writing process, the topics their writing covers, and much more. There are parties, get-togethers, and even a <a href=\"http://www.writersfest.bc.ca/get-involved/writingcontest\">writing contest</a>. They also have a bunch of morning events that are ideal for school groups &#8212; reaching out to youth about writing, reading, literacy, and the world of words.</p>\n<p>This week-long event is a fantastic opportunity for networking. Granville Island is literally crawling with writers, pens in hand, insane glints in eyes. (All writers are insane. We admit this happily.) It&#8217;s also a fantastic opportunity to see your favourite writers speak: a few years ago mom scored us tickets to see Ursula K. LeGuin talk. She was <em>amazing</em> (as expected).

It&#8217;s not too late to apply to be a volunteer, too &#8212; deadline is Sept. 26th for new volunteers &#8212; so that&#8217;s also an option.

Destroying our American values.</p>\n<p>Correct me if I&#8217;m wrong, but by and large taking care of one&#8217;s own health, whether physical, emotional, mental, or spiritual, is not a terrorist act. Neither is choosing to have fewer children, <em>for whatever reason</em> &#8212; be it concern about over-population or concern over one&#8217;s own ability to take care of three children.</p>\n<p>Comparing this choice to the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon in 2001, in which <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">nearly 3,000 people died</span> &#8212; young, old, short, tall, fat, skinny, religious, areligious, male, female, and everything in between &#8212; <em><strong>is fucking abhorrent</strong></em>. What thinking, feeling person could compare abortion to the greatest terrorist attack to hit U.S. soil? Attacks that <strong>shaped a nation</strong>?</p>\n<p>My choice to have one child or three, two or none, is going to affect me and very few other people &#8212; my mom, my partner, my friends (if I have a child and they never see me again because being a parent is a full-time job). It certainly <em>won&#8217;t</em> cause the deaths of 2,996 people to promote a vicious agenda of fear and chaos, forcing Americans to give up liberty for security.**</p>\n<p>Dear Goddess. I honestly can&#8217;t believe that I even had to write this blog entry &#8212; that there was anything to provoke such anger from me. Every time I think we&#8217;ve taken a step forward, we take a giant leap backwards.</p>\n<p>As of today, I&#8217;m viewing the comparison of 9/11 to anything as mild as abortion as the new Godwin&#8217;s Law. You can call it Loon&#8217;s Law, after me.</p>\n<h6>*Or different-gendered person going through the physical act of pregnancy (carrying, birth, etc).<br />\n**<em>Forcing</em> is probably the wrong word, but you understand my meaning I&#8217;m sure.</h6>\n", "post_id": 1206, "location": false, "date": "09-19-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["writing life", "writing", "feminism", "characters", "stories: Bellica"], "text": "<p>Godsdammit but trying to write feminist sex-scenes with a female character who&#8217;s a virgin and a male character who is decidedly not and is also much older than she is fucking <em>hard</em>.</p>\n<p>Er.

He&#8217;s on the run for his life, they&#8217;ve just been engaged to be married.</p>\n<p>See the thing is is that my book &#8212; or at the very least the scenes with these characters &#8212; will probably be categorized as not-feminist because people will see it as falling into the patriarchy trap or somesuch nonsense. When the truth is that there is no such thing as the patriarchy trap in this world I&#8217;m writing about because it&#8217;s run by a <em>matriarchy</em>. If anything, this sex scene that I&#8217;m writing is actually really really different from standard sexual liaisons that occur in this world.</p>\n<p>But, you know, we&#8217;re reading it in <em>this</em> world here where this sex scene may be seen as too traditional &#8212; girl is virgin until engagement, and nervous about first time. Guy is much older and much more experienced. Etc, you know the story and you are qutie sick of it. But I don&#8217;t really have any control over what my characters do.</p>\n<p>The thing is I do consider my works to be feminist because they are not done within a male-dominated viewpoint. That is, even when I write my male characters, primary concern is not &#8220;what will men think of this&#8221;. \u00a0Primary concern is &#8220;how will this affect me&#8221; or &#8220;how will this affect the goddesses I serve&#8221; or &#8220;how will this affect my relationship with other characters, regardless their genders&#8221;. Which is how it is in <em>this</em> feminist&#8217;s life (yes, I am a feminist &#8212; I really hope this doesn&#8217;t surprise you, because it shouldn&#8217;t). If something I do <em>does</em> have some sort of affect on the men around me, that&#8217;s a side-effect that was not calculated into the original action.</p>\n<p>Like earthquakes. Earthquakes happen because the earth needs to release tension. And they royally fuck up our lives in the process, sometimes killing us. But the earth doesn&#8217;t just get up and say to herself \u00a0&#8220;I&#8217;m going to kill some humans today! Yeehaw!&#8221; and then proceed to shake the shit out of us. The earth says &#8220;Damn, there&#8217;s a crick in my spine, maybe if I just stretch this way&#8230; *rumble* &#8230;aaaah! There we are!&#8221; and then it just happens to have an affect on us.</p>\n<p>So replace humans with men and earth with women in that scenario and you see what I mean. (Not with killing, obviously.

I mean, quite specifically, <em>all the food that one ingests</em> &#8212; one&#8217;s <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><em>diet</em></span>.</p>\n<p>Next, I do not speak for all writers here. I am only talking about me &#8212; the food that I ingest in my writerly life. And when I say &#8220;writerly life&#8221;, I mean my life, because I&#8217;m never not a writer.</p>\n<p>Wheee double negatives in English!</p>\n<p>Ahem. Anyway.</p>\n<h3>The Writing Schedule</h3>\n<p>Different schedules create different diets in my life. The first one I&#8217;m going to delve into here is when I&#8217;m writing all day, everyday. I wake up in the morning (roughly). I make a pot of tea and sit down in front of the laptop. I pound out words until my tea pot is empty or my bladder full (or both). I refill or empty as needed, and continue writing.</p>\n<p>This pattern repeats all day, when I finally decide that I&#8217;m done writing and I need to get some actual food in my body before it rebels and kills something small and furry in a display of animal primalness.</p>\n<p>At which point I will gorge on something meaty and then collapse into bed.</p>\n<p>That schedule is my favourite, but it doesn&#8217;t pay the rent (yet).</p>\n</p>\n<h3>The Publishing/Website Work Schedule</h3>\n<p>Otherwise known as The Rent Schedule. This is the one where I work pretty much all day on book layouts or website coding, save for brief breaks to play Angry Birds. (Ok, so Angry Birds is never brief but this is completely different because shut up.)</p>\n<p>I have a nocturnal sleep pattern during this schedule, mainly because my internet works better at night when my landlady&#8217;s asleep (pretty sure the two are related), but also because that just seems to be the schedule I naturally fall into.</p>\n<p>And during this schedule, I live off sugar, caffeine, and fast food.</p>\n<p>I need fuel to concentrate on this work, because it doesn&#8217;t energize me like writing does &#8212; it drains me. So the sugar and caffeine. I work so much that I don&#8217;t have time nor energy to cook, so instead I&#8217;ll take a 10 minute trip to the nearest 24-hour fast food restaurant and get something from the dollar menu.</p>\n<p>No, it&#8217;s not healthy. But neither is being homeless.*</p>\n<h3>The School Schedule</h3>\n<p>This one is over, because I&#8217;ve graduated (I&#8217;ll go back to school at some point, I&#8217;m sure, but for now it&#8217;s caput). It&#8217;s a strange hybrid of the two previous schedules, except there&#8217;s even less time to do anything and I get half as much sleep.</p>\n<p>I stay up late studying and get up early for class. There is no time to cook or really enjoy food, so the best/most/healthiest I&#8217;ll eat will be at the campus cafeteria &#8212; not saying much, with the high amounts of food poisoning that happen there (this is what happens when you get <em>first year culinary students</em> working the kitchens). Also expensive, so about half-way through the semester I stop eating, pretty much. Except for KD and Mr. Noodle.</p>\n<p>I live off coffee, tea, and sugar during school. I would take caffeine pills to supplement, but they cause instant migraines.</p>\n<p>During this schedule, the rent is paid by student loans, and very little non-class-specific writing gets done.</p>\n<h3>What the Future Holds</h3>\n<p>I hope that someday I can be on a permanent Writing Schedule, with some tweaks. Mainly, I&#8217;ll earn enough money that I can hire a personal assistant to remind me when I need to eat so I can get square meals each day, and to tell me to cut down on my tea intake lest I over-herbalize myself. This personal assistant will also arrange for meals to be cooked and brought to me, so I don&#8217;t have to step away from the laptop for too long.</p>\n<p>I will also only write 5 days a week, like an actual job. I will have weekends off and spend them with family and friends, doing <em>absolutely nothing</em>.</p>\n<h6>*That&#8217;s not a jab at homeless people in general, just a note on how <em>I</em> would adapt to being homeless.

The caption reads &#8220;Facebook: you&#8217;re not the consumer, you&#8217;re the product.&#8221;</p>\n<p>One of the most disturbing changes is to how pages operate: starting the end of the month, you will not longer be able to send out mass messages to your followers via the PM system. You must interact with them via news feed.</p>\n<p>Fantastic. How many people have &#8220;Liked&#8221; a page, only to turn off appearance in the news feed? That&#8217;s a good show of hands there, and I&#8217;m raising mine along with you. I like the news feed to have my <em>friends</em>&#8216; updates. If something is important, I assume the page I like will send me a message.</p>\n<p>I can&#8217;t help but think this particular change is a way to stop organization and forming of revolutions via the social medium of Facebook. Can&#8217;t have the proletariat rioting, can we? Why aren&#8217;t they happy with being poor and hungry, marginalized and set aside, murdered and nothing done to bring the perpetrators to justice?*</p>\n<p>So now, with Facebook&#8217;s changes, I am no longer able to alert fans of my author page to special things like book launch dates, book tour dates, giveaways, and other fun stuff that should be exclusive to following my page. Now I must post it all on the page &#8212; where anyone can read it, and it sort of takes away from the whole &#8220;Follow to get exclusive updates&#8221; angle I&#8217;ve been working.</p>\n<p><del>It also prevents me from sending instructions to members of Katje&#8217;s Army, placed strategically throughout the Americas, to let them know when to revolt.</del></p>\n<p>Another change that I find incredibly sinister is the automatic subscription to your friends&#8217; every movement. There&#8217;s a ticker in the right hand corner where you can see all their comments on everyone&#8217;s profiles. Including profiles that were previously hidden to you, because the owners of said profiles are on there to connect with family members, not the rest of the known world.</p>\n<p>That was one of the actually <em>good</em> things about Facebook &#8212; there was some privacy for those who wanted it. I can understand wanting a simple interface to interact with a chosen few people, and not wanting your profile open to the rest of the hordes. Sure, you won&#8217;t ever have total privacy on the wide internet, but it&#8217;s not too much to ask for greater privacy options from sites.</p>\n<p>Now the default setting on Facebook is for all of your friends to be subscribed to your comments and likes, whether you want them to be or not. The only way to change this is to ask <em>every one of your friends to unsubscribe, manually,</em> from your &#8220;Comments and Likes&#8221;.</p>\n<p>You now have no control at all over people seeing your comments on other profiles. It&#8217;s as if you&#8217;re in a large room, and you say one thing to your friend as part of a private conversation, but there are microphones right by you and everyone in the room hears what you said.</p>\n<p>So now, just as I whisper when I go through the border in case they construe what I&#8217;m saying to my mom as reason enough to throw me in Gitmo, I whisper on Facebook. I say nothing to friends on their pages. I only talk about myself. It&#8217;s the safest topic, and one I can control.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve changed my subscription settings on many of my friends, but I have almost 400 of them. I subscribe to all updates, only status updates. This gives me the smallest headache, and takes a small step towards protecting their privacy. (However, I&#8217;m not sure it works&#8230;it seems their other update types still appear in the ticker. I&#8217;m hoping this is evidence of time lapse before the changes take effect, not evidence of Facebook not giving a shit.) The act of changing my subscription to every single friend, manually? Very large headache and not time I have.</p>\n<p>At least we still have veto power. The delete button on others&#8217; posts on your wall still exists. I&#8217;ve never used it before, because I believe in owning your words. But now the simple fact is that what people post can damage my career, which is built almost entirely upon reputation. (Reputation and skill. The latter I have no worries about.)</p>\n<p>In the new Facebook landscape, I recommend sending PMs to your friends, no matter what you&#8217;re asking. It takes the same amount of time and it may save them some headaches.</p>\n<p>Better yet, move to Google+. There&#8217;s a learning curve there, but no bigger than Facebook&#8217;s current learning curve. And Google is more likely to listen to people&#8217;s suggestions (as in adding a third gender option, which is not as good as a fill-in box but still a huge step in the right direction) for improving the site.</p>\n<p>Need an invite? <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/i/epHEo8_wcWc:y91QqWKRuJI\">Here you go</a>. My author profile is happy to have everyone add her to their circles.</p>\n<p>Small caveat, though: Zombie Lane is frakking <em>addicting</em>. (Great thing about G+&#8217;s games: you don&#8217;t spam everyone in your circles with game stuff. I&#8217;ve created a GAMES circle, and only those who play get added to it. Bravo, Google, bravo.)</p>\n<p>As an author, I continue to use Facebook because there are a lot of people on it still, and G+ is still new. I&#8217;m hoping that will change in the near future, and I&#8217;ll be able to use Google+, GoodReads, and Twitter almost exclusively. It seems Facebook will never learn the lesson learned by MySpace: too many changes, and people leave.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h6>*Nothing is ever done to bring those who are in power to justice for the crimes they commit against the lower classes.

Over the years, many books and writers have been banned or challenged &#8212; for political reasons or just some vague feeling of &#8220;needing to protect the children&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Until this year, I&#8217;d never sought to read a banned book. Then I decided I&#8217;d try and find one, and saw on the list of top ten challenged books for 2010 were two books I&#8217;d already read this week &#8212; <em>The Hunger Games</em> by Suzanne Collins and <em>The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian</em> by Sherman Alexie. I&#8217;d picked these up because I&#8217;m on a bit of a YA bent right now, and because I&#8217;m a First Nations major who had the privilege of seeing Alexie speak at a conference several years ago.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s amazing is the amount of YA novels that get banned or challenged. We feel that <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303657404576357622592697038.html\">we must protect children and teenagers</a> from darkness, danger, naughty words. The fact is most kids these days already live in hell, and <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2011/06/09/why-the-best-kids-books-are-written-in-blood/\">as Sherman Alexie says</a>, those dark, dark books give them weapons with which to fight for their lives.</p>\n<p>When I was 11 I was sneaking booze from my dad&#8217;s liquor cabinet. By the time I was 15 I had already tried to kill myself numerous times. When I was 18 and my mom sent me to get tested for diabetes (it runs in my family and I was showing symptoms), the doctor asked me what I would have done <em>had</em> I tested positive.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d probably just let it kill me,&#8221; I said, completely serious.</p>\n<p>He said he was going to recommend me to a therapist, and I said that was probably a good idea.</p>\n<p>Eventually I got onto anti-depressants, and then I got off them for a while, and continued in my deep spiral of depression. I was living in the States, under-age, and drinking a case of Smirnoff Twists every other night, taking pain pills along with it hoping to slip into a coma while I slept (I just woke up in the middle of the night with a headache and needing to piss like a racehorse). I would drive my car fast on dark, curvy roads, hoping to lose control at the right moment. I cut myself a lot and screamed out my anguish.</p>\n<p>Moving back home to Canada helped, but not much. It was legal for me to drink here, so my problem just intensified. I careened from one bad relationship to another and began to believe that I deserved the abuses they dealt out.</p>\n<p>In June of last year I decided I was tired of <em>wanting to die all the time</em>, and went to my doctor and said &#8220;I need help.&#8221; She put me on pills which balanced me and stopped my drinking habit. Three months later I met the love of my life, and finally realized that I deserved to be loved and cherished.</p>\n<p>I can now honestly say it&#8217;s been a year and four months since I thought about committing suicide, and even longer since I&#8217;ve attempted it (directly, at least &#8212; a year and a half ago I was still trying to drink myself to death). While I sometimes say, tongue-in-cheek, that life would be easier if I just offed myself &#8212; that is an example of dark wit in the face of crippling debt and chronic illness, self-hatred and despair.</p>\n<p>So, I&#8217;m sorry, but just where were these people who so desperately wanted to &#8220;protect&#8221; me when I was enduring the horrors** that led to this sort of depression? They want to ban books that may give me hope, because heavens forfend I read about kids overcoming insurmountable obstacles, about how friendship can get you through anything, about how it&#8217;s okay to be a smart girl, about a parent&#8217;s divorce not being the end of the world, about fighting off myriad enemies with only your wits and luck to guide you.</p>\n<p>Now I read YA books and think &#8220;I hope that somewhere, a kid with the same crippling despair I felt is reading this and thinking life is worth living, if only for a little while longer.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Because life <em>is</em> worth living. I am so happy my suicide attempts all failed, because no matter how bad the economy is (I still haven&#8217;t paid all of September&#8217;s rent), no matter how dark things look &#8212; my life is better now. In ways I couldn&#8217;t have imagined when I was 11, 15, 18, even 23. Books gave me weapons. Many of the ones I read that helped me have been challenged enough times to make the list, because they&#8217;re &#8220;dangerous&#8221; for kids to read.</p>\n<p>The only thing that&#8217;s dangerous is for kids to <em>stop</em> reading.</p>\n<p>Had I stopped reading&#8230;well, I may not be here today. Reading gave me courage, hope, and the strength to see it through to the end. It&#8217;s not the end yet, and I&#8217;m not going anywhere.</p>\n<p><strong>For Banned Books Week, pick up a YA book that&#8217;s been challenged. It shouldn&#8217;t be hard; they&#8217;re everywhere. See what&#8217;s so dangerous about giving kids hope.</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<h4>*If you want a chance to win a banned book this week, <a href=\"http://www.plottopunctuation.com/blog/show/banned-books-week-the-adventures-of-huckleberry-finn\">Jason Black at Plot to Punctuation</a> is hosting a Banned Book giveaway &#8212; only thing required is a Twitter account.\u00a0 He also talks about why banning books is a bad idea, and one particularly famous example &#8212; <em>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</em>, by Mark Twain.</h4>\n<h6>**I have not gone into the actual horrors that shaped my adolescence.

For a bigger list of banned or challenged books, I recommend checking out the <a href=\"http://www.ala.org/ala/issuesadvocacy/banned/index.cfm\">ALA&#8217;s website</a>. It&#8217;s probably impossible to get a <em>comprehensive</em> list, but they do a good job nonetheless.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>1984</em>, by George Orwell. A novel about a dystopian future, so naturally I love it. I read this when I was 15 &#8212; by choice, because I wanted to read it. The counselor at Band Camp thought that was really effed up. Not her choice of words, but I&#8217;m able to read between the lines. She said &#8220;Please tell me you&#8217;re reading that because you&#8217;re required to read it for school.&#8221; I said, &#8220;No, I&#8217;m reading it because I want to.&#8221; She shook her head and made a comment about how messed up that was.<br />\nBecause 15 is too young to read about dystopian futures. Obviously.<br />\nAnyway. I digress.</li>\n<li><em>The Golden Compass</em>, by Phillip Pullman. The entire <em>His Dark Materials</em> trilogy has been challenged, actually, but I&#8217;ve only read 2/3 of it. Have yet to pick up the final book. It&#8217;s a dark book, definitely. Not as light as the movie makes you think it is. However, it gives you hope: the main character is a young girl who survives some really harsh stuff, against all odds, and continues on with courage.<br />\nI read this around the time it came out in the States.</li>\n<li><em>Brave New World</em>, by Aldous Huxley. What can I say? I have a thing for dystopian futures (probably because I&#8217;m pretty convinced we&#8217;re headed for one). I read this one when I was 16 or 17, at Fat Camp. (I went to a lot of camps.) I remembered thinking I wouldn&#8217;t mind being engineered from conception to be perfect. Many parts of it I found absolutely hilarious, and some parts I found pretty creepy. It&#8217;s a good read. I suggest it.<br />\n(Coincidentally, my purchase of this book also coincides with the first incidence of a boy flirting with me. Ever. I was terrified and didn&#8217;t know what to do, so I made my purchase quickly and fled the Waldenbooks and the cute boy behind the counter.)<br />\nAlso, it&#8217;s strangely appropriate to be reading a novel of a dystopian future at a camp where they don&#8217;t let you handle your own money and your packages from home are checked for food.</li>\n<li><em>Harry Potter</em> (series), by JK Rowling. Yeah, that was obvious.</li>\n<li><em>The Color Purple</em>, by Alice Walker. Don&#8217;t watch the film. Read the book. The adaptation to cinema is really bad.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Also, here is a list of <a href=\"http://www.wordandfilm.com/2011/09/censorship-causes-blindness-the-5-best-banned-books-turned-films/\">5 banned books turned film</a>, complete with trailers for said films. (I have yet to see <em>The Handmaid&#8217;s Tale</em>, which is the only one of those books I&#8217;ve read, but I do want to.)</p>\n<p>So I guess that makes it Friday Ten? Whatever. Happy reading!

Food service for events &#8212; doing prep work in the kitchen and working concession stands during intermission &#8212; is something I excel at, and as I never tire of having my ego stroked hearing that I&#8217;m wonderful from staff is, in a word, heaven.</p>\n<p>Of course, my arms and legs are killing me because I worked harder in the past two days than I have in the past three months.

I&#8217;m not going to lie, my first thoughts when I heard she was 5 years younger than I am now when she became a guest at VIWF were <em>less than charitable</em>, but her writing is very good, and I was very privileged to hear her read.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m still damn jealous that she got on it sooner than I did, however, and is a good writer.

But that jealously more stems from self-loathing over not getting my <em>shite done quick enough</em>.</p>\n<p>Maybe loathing is a strong word. Self-annoyance. I am annoyed at myself.

I\u2019ve got at least that many as WIPs currently, so this should be \u201ceasy\u201d to do (nothing about writing is easy).</li>\n<li><del><strong>Finish a short story</strong>. I have this habit of making stories too big, and for <em>once</em> I\u2019d like to write an actual <em>short story</em>. If only one in my life.

(A little bit. Not by much.)</li>\n<li><del><strong>Attend a writing conference</strong>. My mother has been doing this for years and I should really start to as well \u2014 she has so many contacts and she has so much fun at the conferences, I wonder that I haven\u2019t started to go to them yet.</del></li>\n<li><strong>Attend a fandom conference as a guest</strong>. Something like DragonCon, though maybe not that big. I\u2019m not sure \u2014 cons where sff writers are more than welcome. (I know they\u2019re out there; I\u2019m just at a loss for names right now.)</li>\n<li><strong>Win NaNoWriMo</strong>. I have been doing this thing for years and I have yet to win the elusive bastard. This year (2011) <em>is mine</em>.</li>\n<li><strong>Become semi-famous</strong>. At least well known in the SFF circuit. That is a fame unto itself, and the one that matters most to me as a writer <em>and reader</em> of SFF.</li>\n<li><strong>Actually develop a technique, and learn what that technique is</strong>. I do have a technique, but if asked to talk about it I start babbling incoherently because I don\u2019t know what it is.</li>\n<li><strong>Get a blurb from one of my favourite authors</strong>. Ideally, Ursula K. LeGuin, but I have a short list of favourite authors in addition to her name.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Damn! 2 done already, and it&#8217;s only been 2 months. Not too shabby.

(And a lot of other Wrimos are as well.)</p>\n<p>This year, I actually planned. I wrote an outline. I figured out the First Plot Point, the Mid Plot Point, and the Second Plot Point. I wrote an overarching vision for my story. I came up with a partial Beat Sheet, outlining the scenes I would write and the missions they had. (Thanks to <a href=\"http://storyfix.com/\">Larry Brooks at StoryFix.com</a> for his 30 posts on how to outline your NaNo novel. I found many of his tips useful.)</p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-img\">\n<div style=\"width: 218px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tim_Hortons_Donut.jpg\"><img class=\"zemanta-img-configured \" title=\"A glazed Tim Hortons donut\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/Tim_Hortons_Donut.jpg/300px-Tim_Hortons_Donut.jpg\" alt=\"A glazed Tim Hortons donut\" width=\"208\" height=\"156\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">This is exactly what I ordered, too.</p></div>\n</div>\n<p>At midnight on the first of November I started writing with my fellow Nanaimo-Wrimos at our Tim Horton&#8217;s kick-off party. In the two hours at Timmy&#8217;s and the three hours when I got home, I wrote 3,331 words of my novel. (I was planning on sleeping as soon as I got home, but someone at Timmy&#8217;s gave me a coffee instead of a hot chocolate.) I decided sleep was the better part of valor at that point, and when I woke up later that day I rounded off my day&#8217;s word count at 5,560. My goal today is 10K.</p>\n<p>You know what happened? I followed my outline&#8230;loosely. I found as I wrote, other things cropped up, and I ended up adding them into the story quite nicely. My main character&#8217;s best friend showed up in Chapter 1, instead of Chapter 3 as I had planned. Which meant I had to actually figure out the right name for him before moving on. I had been tossing around name ideas (I&#8217;m a writer who<em> can&#8217;t</em> write main characters without the exact right names, because I believe your name is such an integral part of your being that to write a character without a name is like writing one without a soul) before starting, but had not been able to settle on anything. I figured, no big deal, I&#8217;m not introducing him till Chapter 3 or so, so I can figure out a name before then. Well, he had other ideas.</p>\n<p>A friend of mine helped me come up with the name (the same friend whom I call my Halloween Santa, and whom I convinced to start NaNoWriMo about an hour before it began). We settled on Evandrus, and she suggested that my main character could call him Evan as a pet name.</p>\n<p>Strange, because one of the names I had thought about <em>a lot</em> when creating my list of possibles earlier on had been Evan. Evandrus means &#8220;good man&#8221;. It really, really fits.</p>\n<p>Another thing that came up that I hadn&#8217;t planned was my character&#8217;s heritage &#8212; she&#8217;s descended of the people her country has just been at war with for the past three decades.

War&#8217;s over, but she&#8217;s still an outcast.</p>\n<p>As a die-hard pantser who&#8217;s planning for the first time, I find it interesting the things that still pants their way into your novel even when you have an outline. (By the way, for those of you keeping score at home: an outline is not the same as a draft, and doing an outline is not &#8220;cheating&#8221; in the spirit of NaNoWriMo. Just to clear things up.)</p>\n<p>In my years of writing, I&#8217;ve discovered that middles are my trouble. I&#8217;ve got a beginning and an end. The middle is this big ball of wibbly-wobbly, spacey-wacey, timey-wimey that resembles tangled yarn more than it does a story.</p>\n<p>This time, I have a middle. I have a mid-plot point. I have bad guys for my heroine to beat the crap out of. I&#8217;m vaguely planning on utilizing the <a href=\"http://www.wikiwrimo.org/wiki/Traveling_Shovel_of_Death\">Traveling Shovel of Death</a> to do so. I have visions of her long leather coat flying majestically behind her as she kicks serious arse.</p>\n<p>I wouldn&#8217;t have that middle thought out unless I had done my outline. And thinking out the middle actually improved the ending I had in mind &#8212; I could make edits to it, make it more poignant. I&#8217;m not there yet, but I know the bare bones of what&#8217;s going to happen, and it looks pretty awesome.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m very excited about my novel &#8212; I really like my characters, and I&#8217;m interested in seeing where they go and how they go about it on this journey that I&#8217;ve lightly mapped for them.</p>\n<p>Back to the grind.

I do this because while it is not just women who can go through pregnancy, but people of any gender who have a uterus, I do see the people who <em>bear</em> children as mothers. I see the word mother as a role-definition, not a gender-definition. I will be a mother when I bear children, but I am not a woman. It will just be my role.</h6>\n<h6>This is a personal definition of the word. You are free to disagree with me.</h6>\n<h6>**Fetuses are parasites. I won&#8217;t argue this with anyone. They are parasites, until they&#8217;re born, at which point, well, they&#8217;re still parasites because they require more nutrients from the host.

Yes, yes, children are magical and our future, but it doesn&#8217;t change the fact that when they start out they are parasites.</h6>\n<h6>Parasites are not people.

This has set us back a bit and <em>Bellica</em> <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">should</span> be <em>printed</em> by Friday &#8212; but not in my hands until Saturday; perhaps Sunday.</p>\n<h2><strong>Regarding Availability of the Paperback</strong></h2>\n<p>The first print run will be very small. Twenty copies; <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/giveaway/show/16269-bellica\">three of which are going out in the giveaway</a> (which, by the way, you only have until midnight tonight to enter). I am selling the copies <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">directly</span> so you will have to talk to me if you want one. Once I run out of the first print run I&#8217;ll do another run; the size of it will be determined by how fast I sell the first 17 copies.</p>\n<p><em>At this time</em> I am not shipping outside Canada and the US. I wish I could but unfortunately shipping costs to other countries are prohibitively expensive and it&#8217;s a heavy book.</p>\n<p>However I am looking into the possibility of <a href=\"http://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=espresso%20book%20machine%20net&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CBsQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ondemandbooks.com%2Fimages%2FEBM_Brochure.pdf&amp;ei=G2DNTuW-IMmwiQLl69zTCw&amp;usg=AFQjCNHoHPB8ijJPPy2WGJcNVcy6FF6AoA&amp;sig2=zDcjrqGZ3yRchN9cROujvg&amp;cad=rja\">permission-ing <em>Bellica</em> through EspressNet</a>, which is the global network of Espresso Book Machines. What that means: you can go to a bookstore local to you that has an EBM and order a copy of my book. It will be printed within a matter of minutes; you pay for it; a royalty gets sent back to me and we&#8217;re both happy.</p>\n<p>Once I decipher the literature out there referring to how to do it it will be done and <em>Bellica</em> (and all my other books, when they&#8217;re published) will be available worldwide. (<a href=\"http://www.ondemandbooks.com/ebm_locations.php\">A list of EBM locations worldwide.</a>)</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t yet have a solid price for <em>Bellica</em> but it&#8217;s hovering at <strong>$26.99 CAD</strong>. I realize it&#8217;s a lot to spend on a <em>new author</em> and people have tight wallets these days, which is why I am bringing up the second option.</p>\n<h2><strong>E-books</strong></h2>\n<p>I am also releasing <em>Bellica</em> as an ebook for Kindle and e-readers that use the ePub format. The files should be uploaded on Friday and then Gods know how long it&#8217;ll take for them to show up for sale on Amazon and <a href=\"http://goodreads.com\">GoodReads</a>. I anticipate it will be available in both locations no later than December 1st.</p>\n<p>Currently those will be the two places one can buy <em>Bellica</em>. I am looking into Kobo and Nook stores but they&#8217;re complex and terrifying.</p>\n<p><strong>The price for the ebook will be $9.99 CAD.</strong></p>\n<p>So those are your two current options; I hope more will open up in the future. I also really hope that you consider picking up a copy of my book. I&#8217;ve worked really hard on it and I want people to read it.</p>\n<p>If you live outside the US or Canada and cannot, for whatever reason, pick up an ebook version but still really want a copy&#8230;I am working on the answer for this.

Namely misogynistic fatphobic rape apologists.</p>\n<p>Which, by the way, the people who utter these sentiments <em>are</em>.</p>\n<p>I get it if you&#8217;ve internalized the hatred of yourself. I do. I was there for a long time. But darlin, you&#8217;ve got to pull yourself out of that trench. Please believe me when I say that <strong>a) rape has nothing to do sex and everything to do with power and b) you are beautiful regardless.</strong> And please believe me when I say that <em>continuing to utter those sentiments contributes to rape culture and fat hatred</em>.</p>\n<p>This is the insidious thing about oppression: we are trained to be complicit in our own degradation. From birth we are put into this culture that tells us these sentiments, these vicious lies, and parades them about as truth. And with so many years of this being drilled into our heads, it&#8217;s understandable we may believe these things about ourselves.</p>\n<p>So we utter these same statements and make it easier for the oppressor to keep his great big boot on our faces. We have been well-trained to hate ourselves. We have been well-trained to hate others like ourselves, to question their every move.</p>\n<p>We have been well-trained to question if a fat girl was <em>really</em> raped, or if she&#8217;s just begging for attention with an outrageous story. We have been trained to believe that fat people are harder to abuse, to violate, because they&#8217;re icky or too heavy. We have been trained into thinking that if fat people get raped, <em>they should be happy for the attention</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>My personal experience begs to fucking differ.</strong></p>\n<p>There is nothing awesome about being raped. I&#8217;ve been through it twice, and because I am CAFAB, present as femme, and live in this society, I have already accepted that it may very well happen again. I can only <em>hope</em> that if it does happen to me again, that I am not so shell-shocked, so brutalized into silence that by the time I am even able to admit to <em>myself</em> what happened it is not too late to put the rapist behind bars.</p>\n<p>The first time it took me 10 years to even be able to talk about it <em>as something I was still ashamed of</em>. It took telling someone else to even discover that it <em>was</em> rape.</p>\n<p>The second time took only a year to accept it for what it was. Thank the gods for small miracles, I suppose.</p>\n<p><strong>News flash: I was fat both times.</strong> Both times had nothing to do with desire. Both times had to do with the rapist wanting to show me who was in charge/to break me.</p>\n<p>Too bad for him, I&#8217;m not broken. And if he ever shows his face to me again, he better have good running shoes on because I will not hesitate in destroying him.</p>\n<p>Too <em>fat</em> to be raped? Happy for <em>any</em> attention?</p>\n<p><strong>How about the notion that fat people deserve love, good relationships, and to have their boundaries respected, just like everyone else does. How about that.</strong></p>\n", "post_id": 1536, "location": false, "date": "01-09-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["POV", "writing", "Catching Fire", "The Hunger Games trilogy", "Mockingjay", "Hunger Games"], "text": "<div style=\"width: 211px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Catching-Fire-Second-Hunger-Games/dp/0439023491%3FSubscriptionId%3D0G81C5DAZ03ZR9WH9X82%26tag%3Dzemanta-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0439023491\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img class=\"zemanta-img-inserted zemanta-img-configured\" title=\"Cover of &quot;Catching Fire (The Second Book ...\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51%2B3FX5pixL._SL300_.jpg\" alt=\"Cover of &quot;Catching Fire (The Second Book ...\" width=\"201\" height=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Cover via Amazon</p></div>\n<p>I just finished <em>The Hunger Games </em>Trilogy. I&#8217;d read <em>The Hunger Games</em> a few months back, and between Sunday and Tuesday I read <em>Catching Fire</em> and <em>Mockingjay</em> (thanks to mom&#8217;s Kindle, which I will blog about later).</p>\n<p>I really enjoyed both books. I think they&#8217;re well-written, have a compelling plot and characters, and make several good points. That said, they are all written in first person POV. Reading them has made me realize quite clearly why people hate first person stories so much.</p>\n<p><strong>1. With first person POV your character must be unaccountably dense to not get all the clues leading up to the end.</strong> Furthermore, the clues must not be as well hinted or revealed as they can be in third person POV, wherein the reader reaches the obvious conclusion before the character does. This effect makes the reader feel stupid, which is not something people like. (That said, characters in third person POV can be unaccountably dense as well &#8212; however, this does not hit you over the head as it does with first-person, where your only perspective is inside the character&#8217;s head.)</p>\n<p><strong>2. The big reveal at the end has a tendency to fall into monologuing.</strong> As the entire story is necessarily monologuing, it&#8217;s hard to show the reveal rather than telling it. This is most clearly seen at the end of <em>Catching Fire</em> [highlight for spoilers] <span style=\"color:#ffffff;\">wherein Katniss explains everything regarding the end of the Games and the rebel rescue</span> in one short paragraph, almost monotone. It felt like one of those &#8220;The Least You Need to Know&#8221; sections at the end of a chapter in a <em>Complete Idiot&#8217;s Guide To</em>&#8230;.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Your message can get <a href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious\">anvilicious</a>.</strong> You are no longer hiding this message within layers of interaction among characters from a third-person perspective or within setting; your main character is stating quite clearly what your message is. You are unable to let the horrifying truth of the events ring through without your main character commenting on them; otherwise your MC becomes a heartless automaton. This means walking the line between subtlety and anvil-dropping becomes more than a tightrope; it&#8217;s a veritable nightmare.</p>\n<p>Flaws now addressed: I think Collins did a very good job with first person POV and I think she had to. I can&#8217;t imagine Katniss&#8217; story being told in any other way. It&#8217;s a good trilogy and I do highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good dystopian story of the rise of the proletariat against tyrannical oppression. Or if you need a good cry.

Also it was one of two books I&#8217;d brought with me while traveling (not including the two I read on mom&#8217;s Kindle). I figured it might be okay, at least.</p>\n<p>Allow me to give you 13 reasons I dislike it. And by &#8220;dislike&#8221;, I mean &#8220;hate psychotically.&#8221;</p>\n<p>[TRIGGER WARNING: RAPE AND ASSAULT]</p>\n<p>[SPOILERS]</p>\n<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Support of the &#8220;Well, she didn&#8217;t technically say &#8216;no&#8217; so it&#8217;s not technically rape, right?&#8221; trope.</strong> The character who gets raped [I&#8217;m talking about Hannah; the other character who gets raped is tossed aside like a piece of garbage, her views never explored] is herself unsure if it was rape or no, which is very common because we all get taught that we&#8217;re dirty and naughty unless we shout <em>no!</em> in a loud voice &#8212; but we&#8217;re trained from an early age to <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">never say no</span>, because then the menfolk might get violent. That&#8217;s not what I have issue with; I have issue with the book itself seeming unsure regarding the conclusion. If the character who&#8217;d been raped could not unequivocally call it that, then another character who knew about it (there were three) should have been clear. Without that clarity it seems the author is saying he agrees that it&#8217;s &#8220;grey-area rape&#8221;. <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><em>Anything short of enthusiastic consent is rape.</em></span> Not saying no does not equal consent. The fact that the character was crying and clenching her teeth just to get through it should have alerted the others who knew about the situation that it was rape. Instead, we get vague hand-waving of &#8220;well <em>maybe</em> it was, maybe it wasn&#8217;t,&#8221; and this is <strong>wholly irresponsible</strong> of the author and holds up standards of misogyny and rape culture.</p>\n<p><strong>2. The structure of the book is highly manipulative.</strong> The reader is lead on a very deliberate route, leaving no leeway for interpretation. Asher has a conclusion that he wants you to reach and he makes sure you reach it. This leaves you feeling used and abused once the book is done.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Horrible characterization: there is no sympathy for Hannah Baker.</strong> She&#8217;s badly written. Hannah is portrayed as cold, calculating, selfish and childish. Suicidal people get portrayed as selfish all the time, so this is an old, tired, trope. Instead, you feel sympathy for Clay Jensen, who is a basically good guy [even thought he&#8217;s been raised steeped in patriarchal rape culture but that&#8217;s not really his fault and despite it he seems to turn out <em>okay</em>, at least] who is in love with Hannah. He had no idea how deeply disturbed she was, and feels she didn&#8217;t really give him a chance to help her. The added blow of giving him the tapes will give him guilt and anger towards her, which is unfair and childish: suicidal people usually don&#8217;t plan big manipulation games like this. We&#8217;re too lost in our own pain to even fucking <em>care</em> about how our deaths are going to affect others &#8212; and no, that&#8217;s not being selfish, that&#8217;s called <em>having bodily autonomy</em>. Also, if you <em>can&#8217;t</em> understand what it&#8217;s like to just want to die because you&#8217;re in so much pain, shut the fuck up about suicidal people being selfish. You have<em> no</em> idea.</p>\n<p>The attitude of Hannah, the whole &#8220;I&#8217;ll just kill myself and THEN won&#8217;t they be sorry!&#8221; makes her look like a spoiled child, and not someone who&#8217;s truly in a lot of pain.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Following #3: White Whine.</strong> I mean, fuck, I&#8217;m not trying to belittle her problems, but Hannah is so badly written that all of her pain seems like so much white whine. I had things way worse, way earlier in life, and I know I had it good compared to other peoples&#8217; lives. I tried to kill myself several times, but it was never to hurt others. It was to end my own pain.</p>\n<p>And when I finally did find something good, something worth holding on to that eased the pain, I didn&#8217;t scream and freak out and push it away because, you know, shit had happened before and <em>somehow</em> having my original fantasies about love and romance ruined made it impossible for me to accept someone who actually loved me. What the fuck, Hannah?</p>\n<p>Like, shit, kid, I get it, life in high school sucks, but yours could have been a <em>lot</em> worse, Miss Heterosexual White Cisgendered Middle-Class girl.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Mansplaining.</strong> It&#8217;s a story about misogyny and rape culture and how it manifests in high school, driving young girls to kill themselves. But it&#8217;s told through the eyes of a male character who&#8217;s listening to Hannah&#8217;s tapes by a male author who couldn&#8217;t write women characters effectively if it were beaten into him. For further remark, see #6.</p>\n<p><strong>6. The only reason this book received so much acclaim is because finally a white man is saying what marginalized folk have been saying for much longer.</strong> HAY GUISE, DID YOU KNOW? RAPE CULTURE. MISOGYNY. THEY EXIST. AND GIRLS ARE KILLING THEMSELVES BECAUSE OF IT.</p>\n<p><em>Oh, thank the Goddesses! A white man finally noticed that we&#8217;re being raped and brutalized left right and center! Let&#8217;s watch him do a <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">terrible job</span> writing about it. Mansplaining: not just for trolls anymore!</em></p>\n<p>I can tell you right now that if anyone other than a white man had written this book it would not have received <em>half</em> the acclaim it has. People do not believe things until white men say it&#8217;s the truth. I say I was raped twice, and I am questioned unless a white man corroborates my story. I say misogyny is everywhere, and I&#8217;m a hysterical feminist &#8220;looking to get angry about something&#8221; unless a white man says he sees it too. People of color, indigenous people, transgendered people, disabled and/or neuroatypical people, and queer folk have been saying for years that the police are corrupt and that police brutality is a matter of course in their daily lives. <em>No one listens</em> until Occupy happens, when suddenly white men are being treated this way too.</p>\n<p>So, yeah. Asher had a chance to actually bring to light a serious issue, and he did it horribly. With friends like these&#8230;.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Dual narratives is confusing, dizzying, and manipulative.</strong> It is falsely compelling: the intense structure made you feel as if the book was compelling, but the characterization was so bad that by the end of the book I <em>wanted</em> Hannah and everyone else in her small town to die.</p>\n<p><strong>8. The message is Anvillicious.</strong> Anvils everywhere. Falling from the sky. Especially as the result of Hannah&#8217;s probably-false suicide and tapes is to force Clay to insert himself into Skye&#8217;s life, regardless her wishes, because may be suicidal. (See #9 for elaboration.)</p>\n<p>We should <em>all</em> care enough about our fellow human to ease their pain, even if just for a while. That does <strong>not</strong> mean we should see it as our <em>personal crusade</em> to <em>save</em> people from suicide. We need to respect bodily autonomy. Bodily autonomy <em>includes the right</em> to choose how you will die, if possible.</p>\n<p>We need to stop phrasing it as &#8220;Be nice. You never know who <em>may</em> be considering SUICIDE,&#8221; and start phrasing it as &#8220;Be <em>kind</em>, because we all deserve compassion and unconditional love.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Also: listen to people when they say they&#8217;ve been raped or assaulted. Believe them. <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Realize what that means</span>. (Ie, YES MEANS YES.) Stop the <em>bros before hos</em> policy that protects rapists like Bryce Walker. The &#8220;jokes&#8221; of the Who&#8217;s Hot/Who&#8217;s Not list, or Justin&#8217;s rumors about Hannah letting people think they own her &#8212; they all <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">support</span> rape culture.</p>\n<p>And Asher&#8217;s portrayal of Hannah as completely unsympathetic with Clay being the protagonist voicing the &#8220;boys will be boys&#8221; sentiment and even a &#8220;you knew what you were getting into&#8221; trope <strong>enforces the idea that it&#8217;s &#8220;not a big deal&#8221;</strong>.</p>\n<p>Irresponsible. Completely irresponsible.</p>\n<p><strong>9. White knight syndrome.</strong> Wow, really loving your portrayal of every single woman in the school needing a big strong man to save them. SO FUCKING ORIGINAL.</p>\n<p><strong>10. Hannah faked her own death. Or didn&#8217;t succeed and was too embarrassed to show her face at school afterwards.</strong> She planned enough to record the blame-game tapes, but not enough to figure out <em>exactly</em> how she would kill herself or to have a back-up plan if the first time didn&#8217;t work &#8212; when she intended to do it the next day. With <em>perfect</em> timing, as Tony saw her in 3rd period and she was &#8220;dead&#8221; by mid-afternoon.</p>\n<p>Then she had no funeral and her parents left town.</p>\n<p>I think she faked her own death. And sent those tapes around to prove a point. Through manipulation. Making her&#8230;<em>a horrible human being</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>11. Her treatment of Mr. Porter.</strong> Look, Hannah, if you want to exercise your bodily autonomy, off yourself, fine. But don&#8217;t bring down Mr. Porter with you, whose only crime was not being able to decipher your totally cryptic replies. The man tried, for fuck&#8217;s sake! You gave him <em>nothing</em>. And then you create these tapes wherein you lay most, if not all, of the blame at his feet for not being able to help you.</p>\n<p>Hannah showed more compassion for her rapist, her assaulters, than she did to poor Mr. Porter. Mr. Porter was already close to suicide when he realized that he&#8217;d failed to help his student. How much do you want to bet her tapes send him over the edge?</p>\n<p>How is that, in any sense, a <em>simple</em> expression of bodily autonomy?</p>\n<p>Especially when it&#8217;s doubtful she killed herself at all.</p>\n<p><strong>12. No clear character motivation beyond &#8220;I&#8217;m an emo white girl who can&#8217;t get perspective waaaaaah&#8221;.</strong> I mean, her torments were <em>real</em>, if somewhat tame to my old, cynical eyes, yet her reaction to Clay kissing her was completely ridiculous, lacking in clear motivation. Is she supposed to be a strong female character? Is she supposed to be a role model?</p>\n<p>Gods, I hope not. She&#8217;s worse than Bella Swan.</p>\n<p><strong>13.</strong> On page 9, Hannah&#8217;s recorded voice instructs her listeners to listen to all the tapes and then rewind them when they&#8217;re done before mailing them off. <strong>When she doesn&#8217;t even know how tapes work why should I trust that she figured out how to effectively kill herself?</strong></p>\n<p>On the plus side, the spelling, grammar, and punctuation were good.</p>\n<p>However, I can&#8217;t recommend this book to anyone. It was horrible, and there are much better ways to get the same message. Actually, I could be wrong, as I&#8217;m not even sure what the message IS. The anvil hit me so hard I have a concussion.</p>\n<p><strong>Final verdict:</strong> waste of a tree&#8217;s life.

My point is, even those of us who write sex-positive stories cannot eliminate the specter of rape from our worlds.</p>\n<p>And I guess what I&#8217;m getting at here is <em>what does that say about us?</em>\u00a0 I know there are writers out there who write rape because they see it as a fact of life&#8230;one that happens to women who &#8220;don&#8217;t follow the rules&#8221;. Or as a common part of conquering another country: pillage, burn, rape.</p>\n<p>And yet, in all these scenarios, people never write about rape as something that <em>just happens</em> to men.</p>\n<p>Which I suppose is proof enough that we cannot get rid of all our patriarchal programming, no matter how hard we try.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s the one difference I made sure of in my book. I couldn&#8217;t seem to eliminate rape, but I did turn the tables: no one is exempt. It can involve anyone, regardless of gender.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s a fact we seem to forget. When we write rape culture, it&#8217;s women who get it. Yet when feminists bring up rape culture as a relentless assault on women, we get shouted down because &#8220;Men get raped too!&#8221;</p>\n<p>Um, ok.

And I&#8217;ve chosen to neglect my blogging in favour of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/dw\">other things</a>.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of arguments against this concept of writing or not as a <em>choice</em>. <strong>What if you&#8217;re sick? What if you have no time to write because you&#8217;re always working?</strong> What if what if <em>what if</em>.</p>\n<p>I accept that there are a lot of things that can get in the way of writing. I accept that writing everyday can be impossible.</p>\n<p>But <strong>if you&#8217;re not writing a few times a week, then you&#8217;re not a writer.

Anything bigger than a shopping list. Five words in your journal. A brief character sketch. Planning plotlines while you shower.</p>\n<p><strong>It doesn&#8217;t have to take more than five minutes.</strong> And if you&#8217;re like me, you&#8217;ll find that if you give yourself five minutes a day to write, you will start to feel better. And then more time will magically become available.</p>\n<p>Writing is a lot like a spiritual practice in that way, actually. Those of us with orthopraxic religions, at least. In <em>Evolutionary Witchcraft</em> <a href=\"http://www.thorncoyle.com/\">T. Thorn Coyle</a> recommends using showering time to ground and centre &#8212; just five minutes of your time, during which you&#8217;re already showering so it&#8217;s not really extra time in your day. The more you ground and centre, the more time you&#8217;ll find becoming available in your day for more spiritual things. Soon you&#8217;re waking up a full hour early so you can sit in meditation. Or whatever your chosen practice is.</p>\n<p>For me, <strong>writing is my chosen spiritual practice.</strong> I don&#8217;t always do <a href=\"http://innocenceandimmanence.wordpress.com/2012/02/17/experiences-with-devotional-dance/\">my devotional dances</a> in the morning (though I feel awesome when I do); I don&#8217;t always ground and centre; I don&#8217;t always meditate, or sing, or do daily devotionals.</p>\n<p>I do always write. Not always on a specific project. Sometimes it&#8217;s two lines of dialogue. Sometimes it&#8217;s a blog post (like today). Sometimes it comes directly from the divine and I feel shaky but\u00a0exhilarated\u00a0after.</p>\n<p>Sometimes I write on envelopes (there are a million I&#8217;ve kept, all with little story notes all over them). Brown paper bags, with sharpies. My arms. Duct tape. The wall (not since high school, actually; you tend to think more about keeping the house in good shape when you&#8217;re the one paying the rent &#8212; though when I do own my own house my writing office will have at least one chalkboard wall and lots of chalk), which may make me a bit more like Winifred Burkle than I realize.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Fred%28angel%29.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"zemanta-img-inserted zemanta-img-configured  \" title=\"Winifred Burkle\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8d/Fred%28angel%29.jpg\" alt=\"Winifred Burkle\" width=\"300\" height=\"214\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Though I&#8217;m not as smart as she was. (Image via Wikipedia)</p></div>\n<p>Actually, a lot more, because writing keeps me sane. As do spiritual practices for many people. Myself included, as writing is one of my spiritual practices. Writing (on paper or the wall or the computer screen) gives me roads out of my own personal hell dimensions. And then at some point, I realized my writing was actually <em>pretty good</em> and I decided to publish. At some point a little later on, I realized my writing was <em>more</em> than pretty good; it was<strong> important</strong> &#8212; because it was yet another place where people could find strong women characters, and we need more of that. Not only that, but it was a place where strong women characters existed outside of patriarchy &#8212; which is even <em>harder</em>to find.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t discount the strength of women characters within patriarchal bounds &#8212; goddesses know we need to see that in fiction because fiction informs real life. But we also need to see that there&#8217;s an alternative to patriarchy. It may not be perfect, but at least it&#8217;s different. (This is why the &#8220;Peaceful Matriarchy&#8221; mythos perseveres so strongly in Pagandom to this day.)</p>\n<p>But that&#8217;s another blog post.

Regardless, SMF is at <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Fort Flagler State Park\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Flagler_State_Park\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">Fort Flagler</a>, an old military base. Pictures during the event are not allowed by any save the sanctioned photographers (<strong>though we did get a photo of just our group, which is okay, on Saturday in all our big feast finery + my Creepy Muppet Smile + at least one photobomb by another Canadian</strong>), but while I was waiting outside for my mom to pick me up (she was six hours late) I snapped a few shots of the amazing view.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://katjevanloon.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/img-20120408-00201.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-1792\" title=\"IMG-20120408-00201\" src=\"https://katjevanloon.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/img-20120408-00201.jpg?w=368&#038;h=277\" alt=\"\" width=\"368\" height=\"277\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Ft. Flagler is a pretty cool place, but it hasn&#8217;t changed much since it was closed down for military use&#8230;in 1953. After being shut down for military use it was purchased by the State of Washington as a state park. So this means <strong>1950s bunks (<em>sans</em> ladders, because army boys should be able to just leap up to the top bunk), 1950s bathrooms (TINY), and 1950s hot water heaters (also tiny, and overworked)</strong>. Despite these small inconveniences (<em>roughing it</em>, eh?), we had a great time (I did have a bottom bunk, which is good because I would not be able to use a top bunk, not even with make-shift nightstand ladder) and great weather.</p>\n<p>Even waiting for my mom wasn&#8217;t too bad; the Gods provided for me, as They always do. I did fine. Except the sunburn, which you can vaguely see on my hands and face in the three pictures below. Only my hands and face; I was fully covered with clothing. Hot water still kinda hurts though.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://katjevanloon.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/img-20120409-00202.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1793 alignnone\" title=\"IMG-20120409-00202\" src=\"https://katjevanloon.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/img-20120409-00202.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a><a href=\"http://katjevanloon.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/img-20120409-00203.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1794\" title=\"IMG-20120409-00203\" src=\"https://katjevanloon.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/img-20120409-00203.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a><a href=\"http://katjevanloon.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/img-20120409-00205.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1795\" title=\"IMG-20120409-00205\" src=\"https://katjevanloon.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/img-20120409-00205.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\n<p>We left and opted to drive to Olympia instead of taking a ferry to Seattle as we had already completely missed the window to visit my friend Leah for coffee (by about four hours). The road from Ft. Flagler to Olympia is long, wooded, windy, and betimes creepy. The scariest part was when we drove through the town of Shelton, or &#8220;Christmas Town USA&#8221; as the sign proclaimed it. There were no Christmas decorations, trees, wreaths&#8230;not a whisper of any sort of Christmas spirit at all. It looked like and industrial ghost town. Where the ghosts are serial killers and if you don&#8217;t drive fast enough you may not make it out alive. No pictures, because we wanted to make it out alive. <strong>A sign at the very last edge of town warned us to &#8220;DRIVE SAFE&#8221;&#8230;or it would murder us in the face.</strong></p>\n<p>When we reached Olympia I had Jack in the Box for the first time in four years (I regret nothing) and we got a room at the Best Western Tumwater Inn (<em>Tumwater</em>? So, &#8220;what you vomit up after taking Tums&#8221;? I&#8217;m horrible; I know). This <del>morning</del> afternoon we started on the road again and drove down to Portland, where I met my long-time online friend <a href=\"http://crystaltrulove.wordpress.com/\">Crystal</a>. This was awesome; Crystal is just as cool in person as online.</p>\n<p>After coffee and lunch we continued on south to Ashland, our next destination, where we would be staying with Mom&#8217;s friend Paula. Paula is in the same PhD program as Mom is. I first met Paula and the rest of Mom&#8217;s cohort in 2005, when I was 18. She was pretty shocked to hear that I&#8217;m almost 26 now.</p>\n<p>When we got there (5 hours in the car later) at 9:30pm there was a small problem: <strong>Paula had moved.</strong> She had sent the new address to my mom, but for whatever reason this bit of information did not make it to me and I was given the Ashland address, which I Googled. Paula was about 30 minutes away, in Jacksonville.</p>\n<p><strong>I revoked Mom&#8217;s driving privileges</strong> and took us there myself after receiving phone-instructions from Paula (my back is at the point where I can do short driving stints), and we finally safely arrived at just after 10.</p>\n<p>Paula&#8217;s house is a funky little thing that&#8217;s being partially used as storage by her landlady. <strong>This woman has two arcade games and four pinball machines in one room</strong>, which is taking up Paula&#8217;s art space. <strong>I am jealous and coveting and taking pictures for posterity.</strong> An <em>Aliens</em> arcade game (<em>*drool*</em>), a Warlords one (which I&#8217;ve never played, but would play so hard if I had it), and four pinball games with clothes on top of them.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://katjevanloon.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/img-20120409-00208.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-1808 alignnone\" title=\"IMG-20120409-00208\" src=\"https://katjevanloon.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/img-20120409-00208.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a><a href=\"http://katjevanloon.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/img-20120409-00210.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1809 alignnone\" title=\"IMG-20120409-00210\" src=\"https://katjevanloon.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/img-20120409-00210.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a><a href=\"http://katjevanloon.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/img-20120409-00211.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1810 alignnone\" title=\"IMG-20120409-00211\" src=\"https://katjevanloon.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/img-20120409-00211.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\n<p>There is also a lot of furniture in the house that belongs to the landlady, including this <strong>awesome red velvet number</strong> that I include a picture of because it looks pretty much exactly how I envisioned the <em>klinae</em>, or seating couches, that are used in Athering (the setting of <em>Bellic</em>a).

Before you write me off as just another spoiled white kid, let me elaborate. The iPad is a business expense so we write it off. We&#8217;re not just writers, you see: we&#8217;re publishers as well.

Each house also puts out books by other people and non-profit organizations, and we offer publishing services to those who wish to self-publish.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve nothing against being self-published, but many contests do &#8212; and we want to enter those contests. Same deal for many writers&#8217; festivals: your publisher needs to get you in. Not to mention, as a mother-daughter writing team who publishes each other&#8217;s books, we have many opportunities to promote each other &#8212; which is much easier than promoting oneself tirelessly. Less spammy, too.</p>\n<p>Finally, my mother and I trust each other&#8217;s judgement in various areas: she&#8217;s an accomplished, professional editor, fantastic at in-person social networking, has knowledge of how to do business and understands finances (ie, how to make money), and has years of expertise in several areas, most importantly law.</p>\n<p>I have a near instinctual grasp of our modern technology and know how to utilize it to our advantage. I understand Internet social networking and excel at it as much as I fail at face to face. I know InDesign, and I&#8217;m good at cover design and book block design.</p>\n<p><strong>We&#8217;re both dedicated, determined, and we have keen eyes for errors in each other&#8217;s works &#8212; you&#8217;d be amazed at what sneaks past in the first 7 edits/read-throughs.</strong> We help each other shoulder the burden of publishing a book on your own &#8212; <strong>being an indie author is difficult, time-sucking work, and it is not an easy way to make a buck.</strong> You&#8217;re spending almost every hour of the day working &#8212; sometimes for very little return, at least at first.</p>\n<p>You want a good, professional book that people will a) take interest in and b) love or at least like?

Communication was sketchy that first week and I didn&#8217;t fully understand what I&#8217;d be doing until the end of the weekend &#8212; namely, a ten-minute documentary &#8212; but regardless, I got some good shots.</p>\n<p>A new camera was in order, as the one I was using was 12 years old and guess what &#8212; they don&#8217;t make tape for it anymore. (We do have access to a firewire to grab the two hours of tape I did manage to shoot, so that&#8217;s all good.) As was a new tripod, because when you take long sabbaticals from filmmaking and move a bunch things go missing.</p>\n<p>I had to film in an elementary school where <a href=\"http://www.margrietruurs.com/\">Margriet Ruurs</a> was doing workshops on poetry as part of the <a href=\"http://powellriverpoetry.wordpress.com/\">International Peace Poem Walkers&#8217; Association&#8217;s Youth Peace Poem Competition</a> and literacy initiative. The documentary itself is about the Youth Peace Poem Competition and how it &#8212; and the workshops funded by it &#8212; have positive impacts on the kids and the community.</p>\n<p>[The showing of the documentary will be on May 31st, during the awards ceremony. For pretty much every weekend in May I&#8217;ll be in Powell River filming and editing, and I have class from 9-4 on Mondays and Wednesdays in Nanaimo (my final class before graduation with my BA).]</p>\n<p><strong>First lesson about documentaries: they are organic creatures.</strong> You can set out with an idea of what you want to say, and how you want to say it, but you won&#8217;t actually know for sure how it&#8217;ll play out until you&#8217;ve started filming. Buy enough film (or <em>memory</em>, I guess, is how they do it on the new future cameras they got) to canvas an entire continent, every day, all day for several months. And about ten extra batteries.</p>\n<p><strong>Second lesson:\u00a0 you have to be ready for action.</strong> That means you must be able to catch things on the spur of the moment; have to be able to drive anywhere, get into any sort of position, <em>run with your camera</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Third lesson: it is like herding cats.</strong> <em>Especially</em> when you&#8217;re filming in an elementary school, just saying.</p>\n<p>Things you should know about me:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I am a control freak the likes of which would scare Monica Gellar.</li>\n<li>I am crippled. Or, you know, disabled, non-able-bodied, whatever is the most acceptable term. I prefer the term <em>cripple</em>, because it&#8217;s how I feel. (Also it creates a bit of an alliteration in the title of this blog post, which is important to me.) I also have a lot of chronic health issues, which adds to the feeling. Regardless, the point is I cannot run with a camera; I walk with a cane; I am not able-bodied enough to really be ready for action. <del>I am also a dense thicket in marshy land.</del></li>\n</ul>\n<p>It&#8217;s been so many years since I&#8217;ve worked on a documentary that I&#8217;d forgotten all these things &#8212; all these things that are so much more important when you don&#8217;t have a camera crew. Ie, when your camera crew&#8230;is you.</p>\n<p>Which isn&#8217;t to say documentary filmmaking isn&#8217;t fun. It is. It&#8217;s a lot of fun. And in some ways it allows more creative freedom than filming a scripted story (&#8220;drama&#8221;).</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also very hard. Because on top of all these points, you must make your documentary interesting. It must have a story to it &#8212; you must take a bunch of bits of film and put it together in a cohesive story with a smooth flow. Otherwise it&#8217;s just a bunch of random thoughts with no overarching theme or message, and that gets boring quick.</p>\n<p>(I have watched some boring documentaries, let me tell you. One I don&#8217;t even remember the name of, but I know it was about Jamaica &#8212; interesting, sure, <em>for the first half hour</em>. After that my brain leaked out my ears and eventually I had to turn it off. Why? <strong>Because there was no story. There was too much repetition. And it was too long without having a clear progression from beginning to middle to end.</strong>)</p>\n<p>So my challenge for this month &#8212; challenge for the control freak cripple &#8212; is to create a documentary that shows the positive impact literacy and peace initiatives such as the Youth Peace Poem Competition and the workshops they fund have on Powell River community and kids. I have 12 more days in which to film, and after that I have four days in which to edit.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve worked with far tighter deadlines before. I can probably do this. However, it&#8217;ll still be difficult: as I said, documentary filmmaking is tough work. Rewarding, but very difficult. I&#8217;m rusty and not as able as I used to be.</p>\n<p>Onwards and ever upwards, I suppose. Tomorrow I go off to film some more. This weekend, I think, will really give me the spine of my story.</p>\n", "post_id": 1926, "location": false, "date": "05-02-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Sean Bean", "what what what WHAT ARE YOU DOING", "Mirror Mirror", "reviews", "movies", "Katje rants"], "text": "<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/lYtJEjpAeOI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span>\n<p>This is my short review of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_Mirror_%28film%29\"><em>Mirror, Mirror</em></a>.

(Or, okay, well,\u00a0<em>my\u00a0</em>traditional day for Beltane.)</p>\n<p>In the Neo-Wiccan Wheel of the Year, Beltane is one of eight sabbats (solar festivals; the others are the solstices, equinoxes, Imbolc, Lughnasadh, and Samhain). It is based off older traditions from various parts of Europe and the British Isles, but its modern-day celebrations are a mishmash of these traditions. Like Wicca, today&#8217;s Neo-Pagan Beltane is new.</p>\n<p>Celebrations of Beltane can include jumping the fire for fertility (of any sort; not just baby-making), dancing around the May-pole (which, yes, is supposed to be a phallus), making lewd motions with ritual implements (or perhaps that&#8217;s just me), candy shaped like genitalia, getting married or handfasted for a year and a day, and unbridled coupling in the woods. Or your bedroom; whatevs.</p>\n<p><strong>Beltane is also known as\u00a0<em>the sex holiday</em>, and for good reason.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>For me personally, Beltane is sacred to Morrigan, who is so much more than a &#8220;goddess of war and death&#8221;. She&#8217;s the goddess of sovereignty, which is inherently tied up with sexuality and being a warrior. (For more on my take on the Morrigan and many other topics related to paganism, check out my writings under the name\u00a0<a href=\"http://innocenceandimmanence.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Morag Spinner at Innocence and Immanence</a>.)</p>\n<p>Also, the sex celebrated at Beltane is, to me, more than just what I do with my boyfriend (though that is\u00a0<em>quite awesome</em>, don&#8217;t get me wrong). If you were to ask me to define &#8220;The Force&#8221; or the divine source of life pulsing through the universe, I would say &#8220;sex&#8221;. Sex is what makes us; sex continues the cycle of life. The earth is teeming with the life force, and it&#8217;s inherently sexual &#8212; if you do energy work, you may know what I mean. There&#8217;s a thrill that comes with\u00a0<em>really great connection</em>\u00a0during ritual or magic.</p>\n<p><strong>What am I doing for Beltane this year?</strong></p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll be doing a small ritual re-affirming my bond with the Morrigan and re-opening my connection to the land and its life-force. I&#8217;ll also be writing, hard at work on\u00a0<em>The Jade Star of Athering</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>If you want to do something to commemorate the day</strong>\u00a0but you&#8217;re not sure where to start, you could\u00a0<strong>consider downloading\u00a0<em>Bellica</em>\u00a0on the Kindle.</strong>\u00a0Today is the\u00a0<strong>last promo day</strong>\u00a0for\u00a0<em>Bellica</em>, and it&#8217;s full of pretty sexy prose.

We are also parents to ourselves, once we leave the nest: setting bedtimes, setting chores, comforting ourselves when we&#8217;re down, rewarding good behaviour.

The 1969 law was still in effect, making access to abortion uneven.

A continuing, building climate of hate towards people who can carry zygotes, no matter their gender, and their loving partners (<strong>this is not a war on women for it effects more than just one gender, thank you very much</strong>).

The fact that it&#8217;s in Tim Horton&#8217;s means it&#8217;s easier to convince my boyfriend to go and get it, so win-win.</p>\n<p>There are several Timmy-Coldstone&#8217;s in Vancouver and the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_Vancouver\">GVRD</a>, but only one in Nanaimo. (There&#8217;s also one in Duncan, which is a 100-km round trip. Not happening.) There are other, cheaper ice cream places in Nanaimo, any of which we could have gone to &#8212; but we wanted Coldstone&#8217;s. It&#8217;s special. And it was a really hot day. <strong>Also we make no apologies for wanting whatever the fuck we want and eating it too &#8212; in public, even.</strong></p>\n<p>Here is the point where I tell you something you already know: <strong>I&#8217;m fat.</strong> So is my friend. And while we are both feisty, fat, awesome individuals, we still struggle with self-esteem issues. <strong>Because we have spent our entire lives being told that we are inhuman, horrible disgusting blobs that should kill ourselves for allowing ourselves to be so fat and offensive to the eyes of society</strong>. How dare we breathe your air and take up all your space with our fat! <strong>How dare we have big bellies!</strong> How dare we eat ice cream or junkfood &#8212; this is, of course, no problem if you&#8217;re skinny and it&#8217;s all you eat, because obviously thinness is the only measure of health. <strong>No, because we are already fat we should eat nothing but salad and watercress and wear nothing but sackcloth and ashes.</strong></p>\n<p>So, let&#8217;s start from that. We&#8217;re fat, and we&#8217;re awesome people and we deserve to be treated like human beings. Regardless of our fatness or awesomeness. <strong>We&#8217;re human.</strong></p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve gone to this Coldstone&#8217;s before. Almost every time we go, we stand there for a <em>long time</em> before someone serves us.</p>\n<p><strong>Today we stood there for<em> 10 minutes</em>. There were several people walking around behind the counter, and it wasn&#8217;t terribly busy. Each person ignored us.</strong></p>\n<p>I stepped away for a moment to look in the freezer at the pre-made stuff, to see if I would rather want something from there as it was taking so long. Two people who were pretty damn tall and pretty damn thin walk up to where I&#8217;d been standing a second ago. Instead of saying &#8220;Excuse me, I was here first,&#8221; and taking my place back in the line, I stand back. As an experiment. (My friend was still at the head of the line.)</p>\n<p><em><strong>Within 10 seconds</strong></em> someone comes up to take their order. And my friend says &#8220;Actually, we were here first. Before them.&#8221;</p>\n<p>And the guy says, rudely, &#8220;So you haven&#8217;t gotten your ice cream yet?&#8221; with this look on his face like<em> we don&#8217;t need any and we shouldn&#8217;t complain about the free diet advice.</em></p>\n<p>My friend says &#8220;No, no one has even taken our order.&#8221; At this point I come to stand with her.</p>\n<p>Rude guy starts taking my friend&#8217;s order, and another guy comes up to take the skinny couple&#8217;s order. No one takes mine, but at this point I&#8217;m too angry to want any fucking ice cream. Not from Coldstone&#8217;s.</p>\n<p><strong>My friend ended up paying over 5 dollars for something that was advertised as 3.99, and she was too upset to eat it. She ended up throwing it out.</strong> She would have refused to pay for it in the first place, but here&#8217;s a secret: we&#8217;re Canadian and we&#8217;re taught to be polite and just take our lumps.<strong> We&#8217;re fat, so we&#8217;re taught to not have attitude about anything because then no one will fuck us, and that&#8217;s the worst fate ever for a fat girl!</strong> Programming is really hard to overcome. Programming + societal pressure to never look weird, lest you get shunned? Yeah, fucking walk in the park.</p>\n<p><strong>I get confrontational on my blog and in my video-logs. I do not in person.</strong> I am timid and mousey in person. I wanted to hit someone with my cane in Timmy&#8217;s. Instead I didn&#8217;t even <em>say</em> anything.</p>\n<p>So here. <strong><a href=\"http://fatheffalump.wordpress.com/2012/01/02/2012-the-year-of-living-fatly/\">Let me FAT AT YOU</a>, Timmy&#8217;s and Coldstone&#8217;s. I am FATTING AT YOU RIGHT NOW. I am FAT, and I DESERVE SERVICE.</strong> Also, how fucking stupid are you at capitalism that you&#8217;re going to treat a fat person badly in a food establishment? Like, seriously. Putting aside the fact that I deserve basic humanity, <em>I&#8217;m going to be your best customer.</em></p>\n<p>Well, I <em>was</em>. Not anymore.</p>\n<p>This is the last I will be eating of Coldstone&#8217;s or Timmy&#8217;s, for that matter. At least at <em>this</em> location. Nanaimo, you can take your fatphobia and shove it.</p>\n<p>I think I may call them and demand reparations for my friend. She deserves her five dollars back.</p>\n<p>Fattingly,</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://katjevanloon.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/wordpresssig.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1733\" title=\"WordpressSig\" src=\"https://katjevanloon.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/wordpresssig.png?w=131&#038;h=38\" alt=\"\" width=\"131\" height=\"38\" /></a></p>\n<p>PS: The sad thing is, I&#8217;m used to this.

I&#8217;ve been reading this book for class &#8212; namely, so I could find a myth to turn into a skit that would be performed in order to teach our classmates about trans* issues from a Native perspective (my class is a 400-level First Nations Studies course in community development). I&#8217;ve found that myth now, and so the other thing I&#8217;ll be doing today is writing the skit and putting together a props list.</p>\n<p>However, I&#8217;m still reading the book. Some of the myths are really interesting, some are funny, some are WTF &#8212; like most myths from most cultures. The one thing they all have in common, however, is they show that the origins of American and Canadian literature were most definitely <em>not</em> heteronormative and cissexist &#8212; knowledge of queer and trans identities has existed in North America as long as Native cultures have. This book is not even a <em>complete</em> anthology &#8212; it is a selection of <em>some</em> of the myths, notably ones where Two-Spirit characters are more prominent then those where they have more secondary or tertiary roles.</p>\n<p>In fact, in many of the myths, Two-Spirit characters were responsible for much of <em>why the world is the way it is</em>. They create cultural traditions, they decide how the animals will be, they create the earth itself&#8230;. They were not people of little importance; they were vital parts of community and cosmology.</p>\n<p>Interesting how easily that narrative can get turned around. From the original literature of this continent acknowledging and even featuring prominently trans and queer individuals to us fighting for our right to live in peace, let alone have the same basic rights as cis and het people do.</p>\n<p>Another example of how colonialism is still alive and well in these countries. We&#8217;ve come a long way, but it&#8217;s not even a fraction of an inch of the distance we still need to travel.

Disillusioned with the Alliance and its subjugation of its citizens, Maarkean, a former naval pilot and supporter of the Alliance, has become a smuggler.

In this case, the American Revolution. One thing that fascinates me about history is the difference between actual events and the common perception of the story. Here in the US, the Founding Fathers who participated in the war are larger than life heroes. In reality, they were just ordinary men in an extraordinary time; flaws and all. This in no means diminishes their accomplishments, but instead raises them up from caricatures of ideals to genuine people.</p>\n<p>When writing <em>Revolutionary Right</em>, I set out to combine that flawed aspect of historical heroes with the concept of aristeia; and to tie them together in a fun space adventure setting. This book follows Maarkean Ocaitchi as he goes from a man down on his luck but still loyal to the Alliance to a man the galaxy at large perceives as a heroic revolutionary leader. Throughout the book he faces his aristeia moment while his loyalty is torn between his government, his family and his beliefs. In the end, he has to decide if he is the traitor he thinks he is, or the hero everyone else says he is.</p>\n<p>In this new book, <em>A Little Rebellion</em>, Maarkean has made his decision about where his loyalties lie. This book moves to follow his sister Saracasi, as fate moves her toward her moment and she has to decide what kind of person she wants to be; the peaceful idealist or the fiery revolutionary.</p>\n<p>While each book heavily features one character&#8217;s aristeia moment and follows their personal journey, the books include a wide array of interesting characters. No hero is ever alone on their journey and no revolution is ever won by one person. It takes a large swell of people, each with their own unique story to tell.</p></blockquote>\n<h4 style=\"text-align:right;\">&#8211;<a href=\"http://waynebasta.com\">Wayne Basta</a></h4>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:left;\">About the Author</h2>\n<p>As a child, Wayne Basta was introduced to science fiction at a young age by his father. Mainstream hits like <em>Star Trek</em> and <em>Star Wars</em> were followed by old Tom Swift novels and then classics like Asimov and Clarke. Growing up on Florida&#8217;s space coast only served to fuel his imagination and love of space, science and adventure.</p>\n<p>At the age of 9, his family got their first home computer, an old Macintosh Plus, and he immediately used it to start writing science fiction adventure stories. He continued writing as a hobby all the way through college at the University of Florida, where he initially pursued a career in the US Navy until an injury changed his plans. Wayne then spent several years teaching high school and working in the education non-profit sector before coming back to his old dream of writing.</p>\n<p>Wayne currently lives in Houston with his wife, son, and dog. He remains a fan of geek culture, board games, video games, fantasy, science fiction and all around silliness.</p>\n", "post_id": 2025, "location": false, "date": "05-24-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["stress relief", "Laughter", "mental health", "Hal Sparks"], "text": "<p>I&#8217;ve found a new comedian to watch and enjoy.</p>\n<p>This is good, because I have had/am having an incredibly stressful week.

Except for one &#8220;friend&#8221; who threatened to kick the shit out of me if I ever cut myself again.</p>\n<p>Because, let me tell you, <strong>nothing is better than not giving a depressed person some fucking bodily autonomy.</strong> I love nothing better than to hear long tirades and rants about how suicides are <em>selfish</em> people who <em>got what they deserved</em> and how <em>we&#8217;re better off without th</em>eir shitty genes clouding up the human race. Which, yes, I have heard. A lot. It makes me feel so much better to know that my aunt, who suffered terrible pain from Lupus and mental health issues, was this horrible fucking person that I&#8217;m better off without. Whereas all I think about is the sorrow at not having her see me grow up and get a degree and have a good life. Or how much I missed going over to her place and having junk food breakfasts that I wouldn&#8217;t get to have at home.</p>\n<p><strong>No, really. Your tirade has helped me see the light. Obviously it will help me get over missing my aunt, knowing that she was selfish and I&#8217;m better off without her. Truly, thank you for your wisdom.</strong></p>\n<p>And, you know, <em>thanks</em> for threatening to beat the shit out of me if I decided to do something with <em>my own body.</em> I keep forgetting that bodily autonomy is perfectly alright for people who have a clean bill of mental health, but the second there&#8217;s something slightly <em>wrong</em> with us we should just sign over our rights and become wards of the state.</p>\n<p>Every part of you belongs to you. And when I ask you to <strong><em>please, don&#8217;t commit suicide,</em></strong> it&#8217;s <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">not</span> because I want to limit your rights of bodily autonomy. You have that right and if the pain is truly too great to go on, <strong>that is your decision, and I will respect it.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>But people will miss you.</strong> A lot. They will miss you and mourn you for years and years.</p>\n<p><strong>And, despite how bleak things may look now, I can assure you: <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">they do get better</span>. The scars fade. Life does get better. Maybe not by leaps and bounds, but by enough. And there are people out there just waiting to help you.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Talk to people.

Fat people are still people and should be treated like human beings, instead of like second class citizens or monsters who live in catacombs below the opera house. Which, yeah, is how we are treated.</p>\n<p>There are also different levels of fat, and if you&#8217;ve never been above 200 pounds you have no idea what it&#8217;s like to be 330 pounds (just like I have no idea what it&#8217;s like to be above 400). <strong>There&#8217;s a different set of oppressions for each level:</strong> under 200 pounds can be seen as socially acceptable fat, whereas the higher you get, the more you get slotted into &#8220;deathfatty&#8221; and seen as an animal. There are very few clothing options the higher up on the scale you are. If you&#8217;re a size 14 and you&#8217;ve never been higher than a size 18, you may be considered fat by society, but you still have no idea what it&#8217;s like to be a size 26, 28, 30, 40.</p>\n<p>Now that that&#8217;s all said.</p>\n<p>I am fat as fuck and hot as hell. And I&#8217;m okay with that. But my health is suffering. Because I don&#8217;t eat as well as I should, and exercising is painful. Part of this is related to health problems that have nothing to do with my obesity (chronic back pain, for one). But losing extra adipose tissue would also help these health problems get resolved. At least to a point where I&#8217;m <em>not <strong>i</strong></em><strong>n pain every single minute of every single day</strong> (is there such a state of existence?). <strong>This is not true for every fat person; it&#8217;s true for me &#8212; so I&#8217;m not going tell you that losing weight will help you get healthy, because fat is not an indicator of general well-being and I&#8217;m not a fucking doctor. </strong>(Pro-tip: all you people who are so <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">concerned</span> about my, and other fat people&#8217;s, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">health</span>, aren&#8217;t doctors either. So stop lying to us; we&#8217;re fat, not stupid.)</p>\n<p>So I want to lose fat and gain muscle. I also want to eat healthy and exercise.</p>\n<p>But I keep on running into road blocks.</p>\n<p>Last summer I tried to do this. I tried to count calories, and exercise. Almost immediately I fell into a death spiral of anorexia nervosa and binge eating. As soon as I start counting calories, I go from eating a healthy amount of food to eating almost nothing each day. I looked at my measures of calories per day and realized what was happening &#8212; I&#8217;ve gone through anorexia before, and it was much worse than it was last summer. <strong>Fat anorexics do exist, and I&#8217;m sick of hearing &#8220;anorexic&#8221; as a synonym for &#8220;thin&#8221; because it erases us.</strong></p>\n<p>So when I saw what was happening, I&#8217;d eat something to combat it. And then the mental refrain of &#8220;<em>fat disgusting slob, always eating your feelings</em>&#8221; would kick in, and I&#8217;d feel really shitty, eat a bunch of high calorie junk food, and then starve myself for a few days to combat it.</p>\n<p>Gee, <strong>I wonder why dieting doesn&#8217;t work for me?</strong> Maybe because <strong>the very thought of starting a diet now triggers my EDs back so hard that I have to tie myself to a chair to stop myself from going out and buying three pints of ice cream to gobble while crying and watching TV.</strong></p>\n<p>I swear, this happens every summer. I&#8217;m sure it has nothing to do with the immense societal pressure that I can&#8217;t escape telling me to have a &#8220;bikini-ready body&#8221;. Let me tell you, being fat gives you no social advantages. At all. Don&#8217;t fool yourself.</p>\n<p>And if losing weight were as simple as eating less and exercising more, then guess what &#8212; we&#8217;d all be slim! <strong>Because why would we put ourselves through this fucking torture of being treated like absolute shit every day of our lives, when it would be so simple to just <em>not</em>?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>If shame worked on making fat people lose weight, there would be no fat people in the western world. Period.</strong></p>\n<p>Shame doesn&#8217;t work. Eating less and exercising more doesn&#8217;t work for everyone. It&#8217;s not as simple as that. A million factors contribute to obesity.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s summer time again, and I want to lose some of this fat. I can exercise. Somewhat. <strong>I can go swimming, if I can afford the 6 dollars for admission per visit, and if I want to subject myself to the judgement of strangers as I swim in my fat person swimsuit.</strong> I can go on walks &#8212; around the block, at night, so no one sees me huffing, puffing, and limping around on my cane because I&#8217;m in so much pain I can&#8217;t see straight. <strong>I can do the &#8220;injured person&#8217;s&#8221; sit ups: lying on my side, clenching my abs, and releasing.</strong> I can do leg lifts, which may not help with anything, honestly.</p>\n<p>Is any of that actually going to help me lose weight? Not any time soon. And in the meantime I get to deal with the looks from strangers and family and friends alike: pity, despair, disgust, loathing, exasperation because they&#8217;re trying to <em>help</em>, dammit, and why won&#8217;t I <em>let</em> them? If they were able to lose 30 pounds in the past six months, why can&#8217;t I? <em>Here, have some inspiring posts on Facebook and the knowledge that you have my love and support and pity and that you&#8217;ll never be as thin as I am.</em></p>\n<p>Maybe I should hurt my back again and go to being bedridden for a month like I was in January. I lost 30 pounds in a month then. It&#8217;s amazing how many calories you&#8217;ll burn when you&#8217;re in such excruciating pain 24/7 that you can barely make it to the bathroom to vomit. What a great diet.</p>\n<p>The only time that eating less and exercising more actually worked for me was when I was at La Jolla &#8212; aka Fat Camp. <strong>They had us exercising for 5 hours a day on a 1700-calorie-a-day diet.</strong> The food they served us was low-cal and horrible for us. The epitome of American Processed Crap. But with so little food and with so much exercise you can&#8217;t help but lose weight, and I did: 40 pounds in 8 weeks. Anyone can tell you that&#8217;s not sustainable, and I quickly gained it &#8212; and more &#8212; back once I came home and had to go to school everyday.</p>\n<p>And hey, for once in my life &#8212; people treated me nicely. After I&#8217;d been at camp for several weeks we were on an outing to a mall and I went to a bookstore. The guy working there was flirting with me and I didn&#8217;t know what to do, because <strong>it was the first time a guy had actually shown interest in me. I was seventeen.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>When I got back to school, I actually felt like I was part of the group</strong> &#8212; for once in my four years in high school. I didn&#8217;t feel like an outcast. I was invited to things. And<strong> then I started to gain the weight back, and it went away.</strong> I went back to having one or two friends who liked me for me, but I was never part of the group again.</p>\n<p>Because of a difference of 40 pounds.</p>\n<p>So, yes. I&#8217;m working on losing weight. <em>My reasons are my business</em> and <strong>the fact that I&#8217;m trying to lose weight &#8212; or what I do to go about effecting this change &#8212; does not, in any way, detract from my support of the fat acceptance movement. </strong></p>\n<p>Nor does it change the fact that I deserve to be treated like a human being, no matter my size, or that my eating disorders are real fucking things, no matter my size. And <strong>it also doesn&#8217;t make it suddenly okay to constantly comment on my weight, or someone else&#8217;s</strong> &#8212; the first thing you say when you see me after a long time of not seeing me <strong>shouldn&#8217;t be</strong> &#8220;Oh, you look like you&#8217;ve lost weight!&#8221;. It should be &#8220;Hey, I heard you published a book &#8212; that&#8217;s awesome!&#8221; or &#8220;Hey, I watch your vlogs, you&#8217;re funny!&#8221; or some other comment on <strong>my actual accomplishments</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Don&#8217;t ever comment on someone&#8217;s weight unless they&#8217;ve invited you to.</strong> If they say, &#8220;I lost a bunch of weight, and I&#8217;m happy about it,&#8221; say &#8220;Congratulations.&#8221; If they say &#8220;I&#8217;ve lost a lot of weight and I&#8217;m worried about it,&#8221; say something sympathetic. If they don&#8217;t say anything like this, then don&#8217;t fucking mention their weight. This isn&#8217;t a hard concept to grasp, and yet people always seem to think that it&#8217;s okay to comment on others&#8217; weight.</p>\n<p>This has turned from an honest assessment of my eating disorders and issues with losing weight into a bit of a rant about the culture of fat hate that we live in, but I suppose that was to be expected. Bottom line: I&#8217;m trying to lose weight. And I have eating disorders that get triggered at the drop of a fucking hat. So <strong>I&#8217;m navigating a minefield of healthy eating and exercise within a bigger minefield of society&#8217;s expectations of what I should do and hatred of who I am because of my size.</strong></p>\n<p>No, it&#8217;s not any fun, socially, being fat. But I have to believe that I&#8217;m strong enough to do this because no one else can do it for me.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://katjevanloon.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/wordpresssig.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1733\" title=\"WordpressSig\" src=\"https://katjevanloon.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/wordpresssig.png?w=131&#038;h=38\" alt=\"\" width=\"131\" height=\"38\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 2041, "location": false, "date": "06-19-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["stories: The Jade Star of Athering", "what what what WHAT ARE YOU DOING", "writing", "religion", "writing life", "paganism", "blogging", "stories: Bellica"], "text": "<p>I really need to learn to <a href=\"http://katjevanloon.com/2012/02/29/ww-writers-going-to-write-gators-going-to-gate-etc/\">take my own advice</a>.</p>\n<p>I have been struggling with <em>just writing</em> for weeks now.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s only partially my fault, though. (No, really!) My laptop is on the fritz, so I&#8217;m trying not to overuse it while I work on backing up all my files from my external harddrive so I can re-format it for Macs and back up the laptop so I can take it to the geniuses at the Apple Store so they can look at it&#8230;it&#8217;s a big process, is the point, so writing has sort of come to a standstill. Writing <em>The Jade Star of Athering</em>, that is. Writing blog posts I can still do on my desktop, and have been doing pretty frequently, actually. (Yay! The Muse is back!)</p>\n<p>So I&#8217;m trying some techniques to keep the muse turning so that when I can sit down and write, I won&#8217;t just end up playing Solitaire for hours on end (metaphorically speaking; my Macs don&#8217;t have Solitaire &#8212; they do have World of Warcraft and Kingdom of Loathing, however).</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Scribbling in notebooks. Ideas, anything &#8212; right now <a href=\"http://wp.me/pOHYI-qz\">I&#8217;m working on reorganizing my religious holidays</a> and various other ADF Dedicant Path stuff, so religious scribblings are big right now. It keeps the inertia of writing &#8212; the action &#8212; going, and that&#8217;s a big help.</li>\n<li>Cleaning my gorram house. It&#8217;s a mess and I can&#8217;t get anything done.</li>\n<li>Trying to go to bed earlier. I&#8217;m sort of failing right now, as I&#8217;m typing this at 3am. But I&#8217;m hoping to get up by noon, which will facilitate an earlier bedtime. Hopefully. Goal: eventually getting up by 7am-ish so I can write for an hour before the day starts.</li>\n<li>Eating healthier.

I&#8217;m quite honestly a pantser with almost everything, but I&#8217;m trying to do some more plotting with every new story, in the interests of expediency. Bellica took 13 years; let&#8217;s not repeat that sort of timeline, okay? So I&#8217;m doing some longer-term plotting with <em>JSOA</em>, and I think it&#8217;s helping.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Those are five things I&#8217;m trying right now. I&#8217;ll also be reading some non-fiction about the Maya, as that&#8217;s the culture I&#8217;m using for inspiration in<em> JSOA</em>. <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Inspiration</span> key word here, so when you read it don&#8217;t write me letters saying &#8220;But that&#8217;s not how the Maya really acted/believed/thought/practiced their religion!&#8221; It&#8217;s not supposed to be &#8220;real Maya&#8221;; it&#8217;s supposed to be Ixile&#8217;a, a people descended from Mayan colonists who had to reconstruct their own heritage after centuries of colonization and shit. So I&#8217;m not writing perfect Pre-Colombian reconstruction of Mayan religion and culture, here. I would honestly never even try to attempt that.</p>\n<p>Also, yes, <em>Bellica</em> and <em>The Jade Star of Athering</em> are set on an Earth colony, but it&#8217;s been so long since the colonists arrived that no one remembers the truth of how they came to be there, and it&#8217;s shrouded in myths and legends. (Well, no one except Magea Rosa, who was around for it, but <em>that&#8217;s another story</em>!)</p>\n<p>If you have no idea what I&#8217;m talking about, you should go read <em>Bellica</em>.

Garbage is no longer every week; it is now every two weeks. There are two families living in this house (<em>I&#8217;m &#8216;a family&#8217; because shut up</em>). That&#8217;s never going to work. Kitchen waste is every week. The green bin is <strong>huge</strong>. It reaches my hips and I&#8217;m 5&#8217;10&#8221;. I could hide two kids and a cat in there. (If, you know, I needed to. Not that I ever have. <em>coughs</em>) <strong>It&#8217;s taken me a month to fill it 75% full.</strong> We were composting before they intro&#8217;d the green bin program because we have a compost bin in the backyard. <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Nothing has changed</span> in our consumption levels. We are fairly eco-conscious people. Therefore, the problem lies not with us, but with the brains behind this city, who must be asleep at the switch.</li>\n<li>Mind you, this city&#8217;s streets were designed by drunk monkeys, so <em>whatchagonnado</em>.</li>\n<li>Seriously though. <strong>This summer, there is garbage pickup on July 27th. Then, because of holidays, there is no garbage pick-up until August 13th.</strong> That is over two weeks. Heavens forbid I throw any kind of party or anything before the 13th because my garbage can would explode. (Why would I be throwing parties in August, anyway? That&#8217;s a silly time for parties and certainly no one&#8217;s birthday.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I would like to mention, as possibly a side but more likely a <em>main</em> point, that garbage pickup across the water, on the mainland, makes more sense and doesn&#8217;t change every gorram week. Every week there&#8217;s garbage, recycling, probably a green bin at this point because the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_Vancouver\">GVRD</a> is a haven for hippies, on a Tuesday I think in Delta. Been that way for 20 years. No change for holidays like we have here, where the whole schedule shakes like a Polaroid picture.</p>\n<p><a title=\"Massive useless greenbin acting as rose shelf. #garden #yesmyplantersayslove by Katje van Loon, on Flickr\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/katjevanloon/7417603044/\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/farm8.staticflickr.com/7264/7417603044_681b1b08fe.jpg\" alt=\"Massive useless greenbin acting as rose shelf. #garden #yesmyplantersayslove\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" align=\"middle\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>In conclusion:</strong> I will continue to compost in the compost bin in the back yard, and will continue to recycle by leaving my recycling at Mom&#8217;s place when I visit.

She reserved a lunch-time table at Koho&#8217;s, which was the fancy restaurant for the middle class in Maui, and then kept completely silent until my birthday.</p>\n<p>My birthday arrives, and after a really awesome wake-up that probably involved opening presents from her and having chocolate-chip pancakes I got dressed and we headed out to Koho&#8217;s.</p>\n<p>We walked in to find a table with 16 empty spaces and Aunty Marsha and Noelle taking up the other two.</p>\n<p><strong>I was really surprised.</strong></p>\n<p>Apparently the above-unnamed friend in the drama program had totally bailed on inviting anyone to the party or even showing up himself, and hadn&#8217;t bothered to tell my mom. (That, or no one in the drama program wanted to come to my birthday &#8212; while either is likely, I&#8217;m betting on the first one. I did have<em> some</em> friends in high school.) Hence: a party with four people.</p>\n<p>In the end it wasn&#8217;t bad. I honestly was just happy that two people had showed. We had a great lunch and afterwards Noelle and I got to be mall rats for a few hours &#8212; I bought the game <em><a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"The Legend of Dragoon\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Dragoon\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">Legend of Dragoon</a></em> for the PlayStation One and maybe some other things, but <em>Legend of Dragoon</em> is what stands out in my memory. Then we decided to go to the top of <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Haleakal\u0101\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haleakal%C4%81\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">Haleakala</a> to watch the sunset. We got up there, saw the sunset, and then in the freezing cold that is 10,000 feet above sea level with the sun below the horizon, our car broke down.</p>\n<p>We managed to catch a ride down the mountain with some nice dudes in a truck, and when we got back down we dropped Noelle off at her house, where her dog bit me.</p>\n<p>At this point I had to start laughing, because the whole day had been such a comedy of errors.</p>\n<p><strong>When I turned 18</strong> I had to work on my birthday. It was tech week for the show I was assistant-stage-managing, and we were doing a cue to cue and light refocusing.</p>\n<p>I was determined to be optimistic about having to work on my birthday because I was turning 18 and <em>could visit the porn shops and get a tattoo</em>, both of which were really important things to me. I did actually end up getting that tattoo during my break &#8212; an <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Eye of Horus\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_of_Horus\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">Eye of Horus</a> on my right inner wrist.</p>\n<p>However, when I got back the director and the stage manager decided to have a screaming fight over half the theatre, the stage manager using the PA system (or &#8220;Voice of God&#8221;) to make his point. Shakily, upset by all the yelling, I went outside to stand with the actors having a smoke. Dale, that fabulous man, put his arm around me and said in his wonderfully scratchy voice, &#8220;Welcome to birthday <em>hell</em>, darlin.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>When I turned 19</strong>, the legal drinking age in British Columbia, I spent a week at my dad&#8217;s farm on <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Hornby Island\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hornby_Island\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">Hornby Island</a>. His side of the family came up from Texas to visit me, and my sister and her husband were there too. (Actually not sure if he was her husband at that point or not; they didn&#8217;t tell anyone about the wedding till after it had happened so I have no idea when it actually was.)</p>\n<p>On my birthday I got up and walked down to the Co-op to buy some cider. When I got there I saw a sign saying they needed two pieces of ID, so I had to go back to grab my passport. I bought two six packs of Growers Cider and went home. <strong>I proceeded to drink 4 ciders over the course of the afternoon, at which point one of the adult family members told me to stop because I was becoming an alcoholic.</strong></p>\n<p>(That evening, my sister, her husband, and my cousin took me to the pub and we drank copious amounts while gambling over cards.)</p>\n<p><strong>When I turned 21</strong>, I was stuck in Powell River working when I wanted to be in the States with my then-boyfriend. My boss asked me if I wanted my birthday off, and I told her no &#8212; I&#8217;d worked on my birthday before, and there was no way my work day could turn out worse than the one of my 18th birthday.</p>\n<p>I came in the next week and she told me my mom had come in and suggested very strongly that I be given the day off on my birthday. My boss and I laughed about it, because <em>moms</em>, and I said I may as well take advantage of my mom&#8217;s insistence and go sunbathe or something.</p>\n<p>A few nights later (this is still at least two weeks before my actual birthday) I check my email. Mom&#8217;s forwarded me an email response from my Aunty Carla. Carla wishes me a happy birthday and sends her love to me. I scroll down to see what mom&#8217;s message says, and in said message she tells Carla of her plans to host a surprise party for me at Local Loco&#8217;s on the 14th and <em>shhhh</em> because <em>I had no idea</em>.</p>\n<p>I keep the secret for two weeks, and on my birthday pretend to be in a really bad mood all day, saying <em>birthdays don&#8217;t matter</em> and<em> I don&#8217;t care anymore.</em> Mom insists on dragging me out &#8216;for dinner at Local Loco&#8217;s&#8217; and I grudgingly get dressed nicely and go out with her. When I see the sign out front that says &#8220;Happy Birthday Jana!&#8221; (because I was still Jana back then) my &#8216;bad mood&#8217; miraculously lifts and I say &#8216;Mom! You shouldn&#8217;t have! Thank you!&#8217;</p>\n<p>We proceed to have a great party and after I&#8217;ve got quite a few drinks in me I tell her that I&#8217;d known about the party for two weeks.</p>\n<p><strong>Last year, for my 25th</strong>, my boyfriend and I spent the first hour or so of the day driving back home from Kelowna for our friend&#8217;s wedding, which was on the 13th (I was ring-bearer). After sleeping for several hours we got ice cream, and I got to rent any romantic comedy I wanted and he had to watch it with me.</p>\n<p>We watched that horrible Hugh Grant/Sarah Jessica Parker bit, <em>Did You Hear About The Morgans</em>, and now Nate and I just have to shake our heads like a horse and neigh a little bit and we start laughing. (There&#8217;s <em>a reason</em> people compare her to a horse. It has nothing to do with &#8216;shaming her for being unattractive&#8217; and everything to do with her <em>constantly shaking her head like a horse does</em>. At some point in the movie she and Hugh Grant share this passionate kiss and <strong>he has to clamp his hands down on her head to stop it from moving long enough to kiss her</strong>. Also she does have some certain horse-like features but I&#8217;m not sure that automatically makes one ugly; I think people are quick to say animal = ugly because they fear being accused of being attracted to animals. Fact is, horses are gorgeous creatures, so saying you look like one isn&#8217;t much of an insult.)</p>\n<p><strong>This year I&#8217;m turning 26</strong>. No surprise parties, no postponed cakes, no dog bites. I&#8217;m going to GeekGirlCon the weekend before, if all goes to plan, and then hopefully a small gathering of friends at either my place or my mother-in-law&#8217;s (I still need to ask her). If that doesn&#8217;t happen, then I&#8217;ll just fall back on last year&#8217;s plan: ice cream and movies with the boyfriend.</p>\n<p><strong>I&#8217;m learning to embrace having a summer birthday</strong> &#8212; sure, it means most people are busy with other stuff and don&#8217;t have time for you, but it also means <em>you can do whatever you want with yourself.</em> Isn&#8217;t that what having a birthday is all about?

Romans! <del>Countrymen</del> fellow indie authors!</strong></p>\n<p>We are in a crisis. We have been selling ourselves short.

Yeah. They take $0.6435. Sell a hundred copies and you&#8217;ve just made Amazon $64.35 and yourself $34.65 for a book that most likely took you a few years to write and countless sleepless nights.</p>\n<p>Price it at $2.99 and your royalty jumps to 70% &#8212; $2.09 a book, while Amazon makes $0.90. Sell a hundred copies and suddenly you&#8217;ve made 209 dollars, while Amazon has made 90.</p>\n<p><strong>Which scenario makes more sense, here?</strong> Who should be getting the bulk of the money for your book? Amazon, who, yes, provides a valuable service but hasn&#8217;t done as much work on your book as you have and will still not promote it for you, or you, who&#8217;s written it, gotten it edited, found a cover design, formatted it, advertised it, sweated over it, lost sleep over it, and obsessed about it from conception to completion?</p>\n<p><em>Bellica</em> took me 13 years to complete. Why would I sell myself short? It&#8217;s <em>worth</em> $4.99 &#8212; hells, it&#8217;s worth <em>more</em> than that, but I had to drop the price to stay competitive.</p>\n<p><strong>Writing is now my full time job</strong>. This means that <em>Bellica</em> will remain that price for ebook format, and the paperback will remain $26.99. This means that <em>The Jade Star of Athering</em> will be $4.99 after the promo period price of $2.99; as will <em>Dead Transgressions</em>, <em>Islands of Fire and Water</em>, and any other novels I produce. Novellas and poetry collections will be slightly lower, but I will never drop my books below the price of $2.99.</p>\n<p><strong>If I drop the price below $2.99, not only am I telling <em>myself</em> that I&#8217;m not worth more than that, I&#8217;m telling <em>potential readers</em> that I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m worth more than that &#8212; and if I don&#8217;t believe my writing is worth the price of a Starbucks beverage, why should anyone else?</strong></p>\n<p>Let me tell you something about $0.99 impulse buys. <em>They don&#8217;t get read as much</em> as the $2.99 books, or the $4.99 ones. I have a bunch of impulse buy books on my ebook readers; whether free or $0.99, I haven&#8217;t read half as many of them as I have of the $2.99-and-up ones. Because when I spent $2.99 or more on a book, I think I really should read it, because I spent more on it. That&#8217;s how the psychology works.</p>\n<p><strong>I&#8217;d rather have 50 people buy my book and <em>read</em> it than 200 buy it and not read it.</strong> Not to mention, if I sell 50 at $4.99 I&#8217;ve made over twice as much than if I were to sell 200 at $0.99.</p>\n<p><strong>Stop the insanity.</strong> Price your books at what they&#8217;re worth. Drive the market back up. Just because we&#8217;re indie authors doesn&#8217;t mean we&#8217;re bad writers; many of us are downright excellent. Someday soon people are going to regard our books the same as they regard any other, and if they buy an indie book they dislike they won&#8217;t immediately paint all indie authors with the same brush.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re worried that people won&#8217;t buy writing from an unknown quantity &#8212; an author they haven&#8217;t read before &#8212; which is a valid fear, because hey, I usually don&#8217;t because I&#8217;m broke and books are expensive, as they should be &#8212; if this is your worry, then <a href=\"http://absentangels.wordpress.com/\">start a blog for your writing</a>. Post your poetry, your short fiction, whatever. Or <a href=\"http://bellica.wordpress.com/\">start a blog for the first, say, 10 chapters of your novel</a> (depending on how many chapters your novel has). Tell people these samples are out there, so they can go and read them and then make the decision. And have links to purchase your ebooks right there in plain sight.</p>\n<p>Problem solved. You help drive the market back up to where it should be, and you set a price for what your book is <em>worth</em> &#8212; not what the masses of other indie authors think you should price it at.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://katjevanloon.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/wpid-capture_02.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-2150\" title=\"wpid-capture_02.png\" src=\"https://katjevanloon.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/wpid-capture_02.png?w=117&#038;h=150\" alt=\"\" width=\"117\" height=\"150\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Related Posts:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://savvybookwriters.wordpress.com/2012/07/05/no-more-99cent-books-decent-pay-for-decent-work/\">No More 99c Books!

With ambition and passion, Literary+ will take its members to the heights they deserve through a tight-knit community of like-minded writers.</em></p>\n<p>Next week, back to your regularly scheduled Katje.</p>\n<h1><strong><em>Themes Hidden and Visible</em></strong></h1>\n<p>Years ago, I was talking with a close friend about the ideas that writers put themes in their writing. My friend said that there are themes in every piece of writing, even if the author wasn\u2019t consciously aware of them.</p>\n<p>Luckily, I figured out the themes of Vitamin F some time ago. The major elements are the social forces that drove me to come up with the story in the first place.</p>\n<p>The first of these elements is <em>Acceptance</em>.</p>\n<p>Bridgett Grey is a petite young woman who is somewhat timid. She\u2019s smart, but has no aspirations toward anything beyond music history and maybe, some day, going out with a beautiful woman. As her best friend points out, Bridgett has a thing for blondes, especially if they easily fit in with others. Bridgett is intimidated by beautiful people, partially due to her shape, and partially because she\u2019s a wallflower.</p>\n<p>Bridgett\u2019s journey, is one of acceptance, not just of others, but of herself. As she gets to know Penelope, the hot girl in class, Bridgett is pushed into being more open and engaging. Penelope gets Bridgett to hang out with more people, most notably the members of Penelope\u2019s sorority. While Bridgett is a wallflower, she also a conformist, willing to do whatever is necessary to fit in with the people she most wants to identify with.</p>\n<p>Bridgett also struggles with the revelation that her best friend, Delilah, is heterosexual, a trait she finds confusing and abnormal. The more she thinks about it, the more the notion repels her. Even in the face of her affection for her friend, Bridgett can\u2019t bring herself to get past this discovery, even though she cares a great deal for Delilah. Bridgett even wonders, at times, if Delilah is simply going through a phase.</p>\n<p>All these little questions purposefully conflict with one another, fighting in Bridgett\u2019s mind to lead her through life. The desires of others bend her just as much as her own hopes and fears. The only real solution for Bridgett is to keep trying, even if she doesn\u2019t know what path she will walk.</p>\n<p>Before the question of acceptance can be fully answered, another element rises, that of <em>The Importance of Genetic Destiny</em>.</p>\n<p>Even though Bridgett\u2019s desires drive her toward Penelope, Delilah prefers the company of men in intimate situations. Society in Vitamin F has decided that Bridgett and Penelope are right and Delilah are wrong, but that doesn\u2019t mean society has the right answer. In a world where science can be used to circumvent all need for traditional reproduction, what impact do genetics really have?</p>\n<p>It would be easy to dismiss genetics entirely when science can provide affordable alternatives for anyone. But if a crash in the quality of genetics can reduce the male population to an echo of its previous self, do genetics matter more or less? Someone, long before the start of Vitamin F, decided the answer to that question was genetics matter more. The real answer is actually in your hands, reader, and no one can take that from you.</p>\n<p>In a world where women are the bulk of the population and homosexuality the officially recognized sexual preference, would it not be better if everyone was a lesbian? Men have fewer rights and more obligations in Vitamin F. Heterosexual marriage is no longer recognized by the state. Groups like the Office of Genetic Security\u2014an organization tasked with protecting the gene pool\u2014would call themselves champions of genetic diversity, but are they deluding themselves?</p>\n<p>The dominant male presence in Vitamin F comes from Adam John, a zealot who believes in his cause enough to drive him toward <em>Extremism</em>.</p>\n<p>Adam John wants to return to the society of the past, where men ruled everything and rote obedience was expected and enforced. He is willing to use any and all means to achieve this, especially murder and terrorism. He seeks holy war to satisfy his need to dominate the world, though he enjoys more visceral methods to advance his plans further, both in violence and in spreading his genes.</p>\n<p>Even though Adam John despises the Queen, the government, and the controls they set in place, he is still a product of their actions. Without decades of state-mandated regulation of reproduction and sexual intercourse, people like Adam John would come about less often. Locking men like Bridgett\u2019s grandfather away from the general population for their own protection has transformed them into a lower class. To many women, men are less than human, a subspecies kept alive to ensure the survival of future generations.</p>\n<p>The first Queen decided heterosexuals and men were an abomination. Since she refused to accept them, her descendants took increasingly extreme actions to regulate, secure, and eventually confine anyone who didn\u2019t adhere to their definition of genetic diversity. The believed it for so long, the Office of Genetic Security took shape to clinically regulate any outliers, using the most severe and impressive of penalties.</p>\n<p>How far would you go to secure the gene pool? What would you be willing to do to make sure humanity could continue for generations? What, if anything, would you accept and make essential to the survival of the world?</p>\n<p>These are the questions lying between the words of Vitamin F. They wait not to be asked, but for you to find the answers.</p>\n<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>\n<h4>Len Berry, a lifelong resident of Missouri, studied biology before turning his imagination toward writing.

(You know in between all the other things I have planned like DRAGON*CON.)</p>\n<p>And I am off because tonight is Battlestar Galactica night; we&#8217;re about to finish the final season and WE ARE SO EXCITED.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right;\">-Katje</p>\n", "post_id": 218, "location": false, "date": "07-31-2009", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["spinal injury wheeee", "life", "clusterfucks", "Powell River", "Coquitlam", "Vancouver Island", "moving", "Pirates and Fairies", "Nanaimo", "Home", "Vancouver", "local"], "text": "<p>Some of you may know that I moved recently. I talked about it a bit before my blogging, social media, and Youtube hiatus &#8212; not a planned hiatus, by the way, I just got so bogged down with the realities of moving and other work (like finishing the proofing of <a href=\"https://www.createspace.com/3837301\"><em>Bellica</em>&#8216;s third edition</a>) that I literally had no time to write or video myself doing stupid shit.</p>\n<p>All of my moves have been difficult, but this one seemed harder than most of them. Probably because it was just me and my mom doing <em>most</em> of the heavy lifting, and I have a spinal injury (that is now doing a lot worse than it was). Also because the place I was moving into was even smaller than my two-room basement suite that I&#8217;d resided in for one and half years, and I had to not only pack my belongings but, horror among horrors, <em>sort</em> and <em>organize</em> them so I could send half of my stuff to storage in Powell River (read: mom&#8217;s garage). I also had to get rid of stuff. <strong>My biggest problem was my double-sized foam mattress that I dearly loved.</strong></p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not really good at either of these things. Well, ok, I <em>am</em> good at organization, but it takes me a long time, and I didn&#8217;t have that time in August. So it was very stressful, trying to get it done SOOPER QUICK, as my timetable demanded. I was also trying to get out of my place a day early so I could make it to Pirates and Fairies on Lake Sasamat early on the first day (Friday, the 31st of August). Pirates and Fairies is an annual event that I&#8217;ve attended since 2010. It&#8217;s where I met my boyfriend, and his mom runs the whole weekend. It&#8217;s a hell of a lot of fun and I was planning on being a vendor and selling books there this year, so I needed to get there on time.</p>\n<p>You can probably guess by my saying the above that I <em>didn&#8217;t</em> make it on time.</p>\n<p><strong>This move was a clusterfuck of clusterfucks.</strong> Each cluster of fucks was created out of smaller clusters of fucks, down and down and down until we got to <em>hypothetical particle</em> clusterfucks.</p>\n<p>My mom had the bright idea of offering the mattress and box spring to a guy with a truck &#8212; he could take a bunch of other stuff up to Powell River in the truck, and get the mattress and box spring as payment. This guy does work for my mom around the house, and he&#8217;s trying to get his life back on track after some troubles. Mom&#8217;s helping him do that by offering him work.</p>\n<p>Ok, so, got truck. Getting rid of mattress. Other big stuff going in truck. Mom&#8217;s leaving dog with me for a few hours, and he&#8217;s taking dog back up to Powell River with him. All settled.</p>\n<p>Except he needed a new clutch for his truck, and didn&#8217;t have any money to do it. So mom fronted him some money so he could get the clutch done, and it got done.</p>\n<p>We expected him to get on the 8am ferry to Comox, which would have put him in Nanaimo at noon-ish. So when 11:30 rolled around and we hadn&#8217;t heard from him, we gave him a call to see where he was.</p>\n<p><strong>He was still home, because he&#8217;d forgotten he needed money for the ferry.</strong> So we had to send money via email transfer and he had to grab the cash and rush down here. We sent some extra for gas. He went to catch the noon ferry.</p>\n<p>You have to understand, the ferry schedule from Comox to Powell River can make life next to IMPOSSIBLE. He needed to be back that evening, which meant he had to get back for the 7:15pm ferry. This means leaving Nanaimo at 3:30pm at the very latest. The noon ferry from Powell River, which is the next ferry when you miss the 8am, puts you in Nanaimo around 3pm.</p>\n<p>So I was scrambling to get things done because we&#8217;d only have 20 minutes to load a bunch of heavy shit into his truck, and he has a bad back too &#8212; because he broke his neck a while ago. (We should form a club: Crippled Spines Anonymous. Instead of free coffee, there&#8217;d be free Naproxen and Tramadol.)</p>\n<p>At 3pm, I get a phone call. It&#8217;s Truck-Guy (hereafter referred to as TG). He&#8217;s out of gas, and has no money. Or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerrycan\">jerrycan</a>. <strong>He&#8217;s stuck on the highway about a 100 metres from a gas station. </strong></p>\n<p>I scramble. I try to get a hold of a friend who has a jerrycan, to see if he can drive out there and get TG some gas. No go; he&#8217;s not around today. I try to get a hold of mom, who is now on a ferry to Vancouver, to see if I can borrow some money from her because all I have on me is my money for the ferry &#8212; ~70 bucks for a one-way trip. No go; she doesn&#8217;t answer her cell phone.</p>\n<p>So I grab the dog, grab my bag, and rush out to the car. We drive up to the gas station right by where he&#8217;s stopped, and I buy a jerrycan from them. Jerrycans are more expensive than I thought they would be, for the record. I then have to buy enough gas to put into the jerrycan, which is just enough to get him to my place. I meet him, give him the jerrycan, and tell him I&#8217;ll see him back at the house. I then rush home so I can finish getting stuff ready to get into the truck.</p>\n<p>Tyee the wolf-dog is very excited during all of this. He <em>loves</em> TG, so in the absence of Pack Leader (mom) he&#8217;s excited to see other members of the pack, together as they should be.</p>\n<p>TG arrives, we start hustling to get my sewing-machine-in-a-table loaded in, my Japanese cabinet that I use as altar-space, a bunch of boxes, and we&#8217;re planning on putting the mattress and box spring on top of everything. But he&#8217;s afraid his shocks won&#8217;t hold out if we load too much stuff on, so we put a few more boxes and two very light pieces of furniture in instead. He grabs Tyee, who&#8217;s totally excited YAY OMG to go for a truck ride and all of Tyee&#8217;s stuff (the dog does not travel light, let me tell you), I give him 40 bucks for gas so he can actually, you know, <em>make it</em> to the ferry, and he goes on his merry way.</p>\n<p>I chat with mom, let her know what happened, and she pays me back the 66 bucks I spent on jerrycan and gas for him. (And a Kit-Kat bar, ok, yes, I was stressed and hungry and there was no food in my rapidly-emptying house<em> so sue me</em>.) Then, I get back to packing for several hours. I assume TG has made it to Powell River and everything is hunky dory.</p>\n<p>(Ugh, remind me never to use &#8216;hunky dory&#8217; again.)</p>\n<p>Around 8:30pm mom calls me.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Guess what happened?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We won the lottery and everything is sunshine and unicorn farts?&#8221; I say rather facetiously.</p>\n<p>&#8220;<strong>TG&#8217;s truck broke down.</strong>&#8220;</p>\n<p>You see, before the clutch could even get fixed the transmission had to be replaced. And TG had bought a transmission from a guy for a <em>really good deal</em>.</p>\n<p>This same guy who gave TG the <em>really good deal</em> cannot be found now. And asking around town has revealed that he&#8217;s done this sort of thing before.</p>\n<p>So TG and Tyee hitchhike a ride to the ferry because TG <em>needs</em> to be back that evening (long story), but they don&#8217;t make it on time. They decide to camp out on the beach. Some people who live nearby give him and the dog a blanket and some food.</p>\n<p>At this point I just start laughing. The day has been such a long series of <em>what-the-fuckery</em> that I can&#8217;t <em>help</em> but laugh. So my shit is in TG&#8217;s truck and on the highway somewhere, exposed to the elements and less-than-savory people of Vancouver Island. TG and my dog are on the beach by the ferry, camping out (the dog is ecstatic about this; this is a friggin <em>adventure,</em> what fun<em> omg yay</em>). There is now no more hope of TG coming down again the next day for the mattress and box spring and whatever else we can cram in, so we need to find a new solution.</p>\n<p>Laughter was definitely a better option than what I wanted to do, which was a.) cry, b.) have a nervous break down, and c.) fix everything with gasoline and a match.</p>\n<p>So I laughed, and mom and I figured out what to do next.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://katjevanloon.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/wpid-capture_02.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-2150\" title=\"wpid-capture_02.png\" src=\"https://katjevanloon.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/wpid-capture_02.png?w=33&#038;h=36\" alt=\"\" width=\"33\" height=\"36\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 2192, "location": false, "date": "09-18-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["spinal injury wheeee", "life", "clusterfucks", "humour", "Powell River", "Battlestar Galactica", "Coquitlam", "Vancouver Island", "Doctor Who", "moving", "Pirates and Fairies", "Nanaimo", "Home", "local"], "text": "<p>(Read <a title=\"The Saga of the Move: Part 1, or \u201cA New\u00a0Home\u201d\" href=\"http://katjevanloon.com/2012/09/17/the-saga-of-the-move-part-1-or-a-new-home/\">Part 1</a> here.)</p>\n<p>We now had more problems than we&#8217;d started out the day with: <strong>not only did we no longer have the use of TG&#8217;s truck to get rid of some of the big stuff, including the mattress and box spring, but now we had to work on getting the truck to Courtenay Car Centre and getting it fixed.</strong></p>\n<p>We worked on the second problem first. Mom arranged for her and TG to wait by the truck for BCAA to tow it to the car place (this is two days later). She would then come down to Nanaimo to help me, as well as somehow cramming my massive mattress into the Pegasus (her Volvo station-wagon; mine is the Galactica &#8212; yes we&#8217;re giant nerds).</p>\n<p>I was expecting mom to arrive at my place mid-afternoon, but she was several hours late. Apparently she and TG had waited in the blistering hot sun for BCAA for <em>over two hours</em>. They couldn&#8217;t call, because his phone was out of minutes, and she&#8217;d forgotten her phone at home. So finally she drove around in search of a phone she could use, and called BCAA again, asking where the hell they were, and it turns out the original request for a tow had gotten lost in the system. She arranged for them to tow without her presence, which for some reason hadn&#8217;t been possible before (yay silly company policies), and then came down to my place.</p>\n<p>She&#8217;d instructed me to fold my mattress in half and tie it with rope. It&#8217;s all foam, so this was feasible&#8230;just not easy. She walked in to find me lying on top of it in an awkward position, shouting more bile and vitriol at the thing than I thought I had in me. She came and helped, and with our combined fattitude and lexicon of swear words we got it done.</p>\n<p>Being fat can be <em>incredibly useful</em> when one is moving or packing a very full suitcase. <strong>I&#8217;m just saying</strong>.</p>\n<p>We then dragged the incredibly heavy mattress out to the car, along with a bunch of other stuff that was to go to Powell River. At this point I was feeling a certain level of despair, because every time we moved more stuff out, the house didn&#8217;t look any less full. <strong>It was like everything I owned multiplied when my back was turned.</strong> (Especially hangers. Those things are worse than rabbits whose insurance covers Viagra but not birth control. Political joke high five!) Sort of like that scene in <em>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</em> where they break into Bellatrix Lestrange&#8217;s Gringotts vault and everything has a Gemino curse on it. Actually, <em>exactly</em> like that. <del>And then I rode a dragon to freedom.</del></p>\n<p>But, you know. Perseverance. It&#8217;s a virtue, or something. I&#8217;m not actually sure; I lead a life of vice, not virtue. But I digress!</p>\n<p>We continued on, despite the lack of truck making it so mom had to take extra trips between Nanaimo and Coquitlam. She worked really hard during this move, and if she liked gifts like flowers or chocolates I&#8217;d give them to her in thanks. As it is I think she just wants me to work hard on her books and stuff, so I&#8217;m going to do that. I guess.</p>\n<p>Eventually it became apparent that there was no way we could get everything either a) to mom&#8217;s place for storage or b) to my new home in time. I was planning on getting out of there on Thursday, the 30th. I needed more time. <strong>I needed a TARDIS</strong>. <del>I decided to go undercover at a weight loss company so the Doctor would rescue me.</del> I didn&#8217;t have one, and I missed my deadline by a long shot.</p>\n<p>Not to mention, getting stuff out of my old place and up to the car in the first place is difficult, to say the least. It was made harder by mom having Tyee with her on her next trip to my place, because the dog has anxiety issues and can&#8217;t be left inside a house or a car for any length of time.</p>\n<p>First, to get out of my place you need to navigate whatever it is you&#8217;re carrying through a haphazard arrangement of furniture towards the front door &#8212; which is higher off the ground than the rest of the floor. One step out, you immediately turn right to go up two more steps, and then walk up a sloping sidewalk along the side of the house to the gate that separates the front yard from the back yard. This gate opens <em>towards</em> you, and once you&#8217;re through it you must navigate a path through bushes towards the gate to the driveway. We were doing this at night and there is a motion-detecting light &#8212; but it only turns on if you waggle your butt at it rather flirtatiously, and that&#8217;s hard to do with a spinal injury, let alone with a spinal injury carrying furniture and/or boxes to the car. <strong>The next gate opens towards you again, and this time you must open it, get the stuff out, and close it so it latches without letting one-hundred-and-twenty pounds of rambunctious, anxious, abandonment-issue wolf bound <em>through</em> you out the gate to the car because dammit, he&#8217;s not letting you leave him behind.</strong></p>\n<p>This takes&#8230;strategy.</p>\n<p>We started two piles outside. One was the Coquitlam Pile, and the other was the Storage Pile. At this point, the Storage Pile was going to a carport belonging to some friends &#8212; most of it is still there, actually &#8212; because we didn&#8217;t have time to get it to Powell River or Coquitlam, and my friends were nice enough to lend me their space. Part of the Coquitlam Pile was going into my car, into mom&#8217;s car, and whatever didn&#8217;t fit with the stuff I&#8217;d already pre-packed for Pirates and Fairies and the stuff she crammed into her car was going to sit with the rest of the Storage Pile at friends&#8217; carport.</p>\n<p>Then mom would do a car load for the Storage Pile and whatever else was going to the carport, while I&#8217;d sit in the yard with Tyee on a chain lead (if you look away for a second while he&#8217;s on the leather or cloth one, he eats it). Mom would load the car with the gate propped open, and Tyee would sit and watch very carefully. <strong>Then she&#8217;d take off to unload the car at my friends&#8217; place, and he would pace and whine anxiously while I did more packing and moving of stuff to the yard.</strong></p>\n<p>Once we got the bedroom empty, I cleaned the hell out of it, and that followed for the other rooms. I had to borrow my upstairs neighbor&#8217;s vacuum cleaner because my vacuum cleaner broke a long time ago and I hadn&#8217;t had a chance to get it fixed or get a new one.</p>\n<p>By this point, it was Friday evening. We were hoping to be out Saturday morning so I had a chance in hell of making it to Pirates and Fairies before I <em>died.</em></p>\n<p>That didn&#8217;t really happen.</p>\n<p>But this isn&#8217;t even the entire story &#8212; <strong>before Friday evening rolled around and we worked all night through to get everything done on time, mom was dealing with her own clusterfucks in Coquitlam.</strong></p>\n", "post_id": 2198, "location": false, "date": "09-19-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["writing life", "editing", "poetry"], "text": "<p>In case you go looking for the second poem I mentioned in my last entry, it&#8217;s not up.

This meant there needed to be space for my stuff, first of all, and that my grandparents&#8217; stuff needed to be moved <em>out</em>. That is, we needed to move out what we <em>could</em> of my grandparents&#8217; stuff &#8212; part of the reason I had to get rid of my bed is that we couldn&#8217;t get rid of the two singles in their old bedroom (it&#8217;s like an episode of <em>I Love Lucy</em> every night, except instead of my husband in the second bed, it&#8217;s my mom &#8212; nothing says <em>awkward</em> more than being 26 and having to share a bedroom with your mom; luckily, she&#8217;s travelling a lot and spending a lot of time in her other house in Powell River. Also my boyfriend&#8217;s house is close to my new apartment and he has his own bedroom).</p>\n<p>Something my mom had noticed a week and a half or so before the end of the month was that the washer was leaking. It was a stacking unit and it had been in the apartment since Oma had bought the place &#8212; 20 years ago. It was also a pretty good washing machine and dryer combo &#8212; it had never let us down before. So mom called a repair guy.</p>\n<p><strong>It was unfixable</strong>. The bottom had completely rusted through and we needed to get a completely new washer. And dryer, because a stacking unit is useless if one part is broken.</p>\n<p>So mom went to the Brick, and ordered some new fancy HE (High Efficiency) machines for the place. They were separate, but you can stack them if you have a kit, and she also got a drawer to put underneath the washer into which I can put laundry detergent. This has the added benefit of making the washer and dryer tall, meaning I don&#8217;t have to bend as much. It&#8217;s not going to be as easy on <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through;\">short stuff</span> mom, but then what kind of daughter would I be if I didn&#8217;t help my mom with household chores? (A shitty one, if you need the answer spelled out for you. If you&#8217;re an adult and living with your parents, you better fucking pull your own weight around the house.)</p>\n<p>The Brick dudes arrived shortly thereafter with the washer and dryer, and of course mom had to be there for that. Except&#8230;oh, <strong>they didn&#8217;t have the stacking kit.</strong> So they put the washer on the drawer and left the dryer in the dining room until they could come back with the stacking kit and get it all set up. The next possible date they could arrive? Friday, September 7th.</p>\n<p>Mom may have blacked out with rage, waking up with dried blood under her nails. I can neither confirm nor deny that.</p>\n<p>(Not only did they forget the stacking kit, they also made mom buy <em>two</em> drawers instead of just one because of some sort of deal they were having. So mom said, fine, just bring them unattached. They arrived <em>attached</em> to each the washer and dryer. *headdesk* Also, they were under pressure from their new computer system that supposedly routes all their appointments and tells them where to go in an efficient manner, but it&#8217;s <em>always fucking wrong</em>. They tell <em>it</em> where to go, and it goes all HAL 9000 on them and tries to kill them. So there was a lot of stress on both sides. Please don&#8217;t go attack the Brick after reading this entry. They really are nice people. They just have to deal with homicidal computers and miscommunication.)</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, she&#8217;s trying to get all the furniture moved in, but this apartment building has small doors and the dolly has one half-flat tire and mom is doing this all by herself. <strong>So she&#8217;s struggling with the desks and other crap I own and trying to move it through narrow hallways and getting rid of Oma and Opa&#8217;s old stuff and dealing with crap and being adult in a way that I can never hope to master</strong>.</p>\n<p>Somehow, because she&#8217;s a fucking wizard, she gets everything ready on time for me to move in. Except the washer and dryer, but that&#8217;s not really her fault. The dryer stood in the dining room until this past Friday, looking like it wanted dinner.</p>\n<p>Then she came back over to Nanaimo and continued to help me with packing and moving and cleaning and packing and moving and cleaning and packing and moving and cleaning and<em> not dying</em>.</p>\n<p>We didn&#8217;t finish moving everything for Storage to my friends&#8217; carport and packing up our two cars until noon on Saturday. Cleaning was another fun adventure, with me on my hands and knees in soapy water soaking my jeans scrubbing with Magic Erasers at strange, incriminating, unknowable stains on my linoleum floor, singing songs from Disney (I&#8217;m sure you can guess which one in particular; I was even wearing a kerchief over my hair).</p>\n<p>Each of us slept only a few hours that night. Mom crashed on the two foamie mattresses I kept on my living room floor as a sofa (which I kept and brought to Pirates and Fairies, and they are now at my boyfriend&#8217;s place with all the camping equipment), and I eventually sat down on the White Chair, RIP, to &#8220;close my eyes for a few minutes&#8221; around five a.m. I woke up around nine a.m. with a coffee in my hand, fully upright, and a blanket over me. Mom told me that around seven she came by with coffee and a bacon breakfast sandwich from Starbucks for me and put the coffee in my hand and the sandwich in my lap, and I&#8217;d waked up enough to grab it from her and situate the sandwich on my arm. <strong>I have no memory of this.</strong> She also told me that she&#8217;d come back after running an errand to find me still asleep, and feared that I&#8217;d dropped the coffee &#8212; she pulled back the blanket to see it still sat perfectly upright in my death grip, still nice and warm after being under the blanket. I also have no memory of this. But I did not spill my coffee, and I drank it gratefully when I finally did wake from my slumber of the dead. (I really should make a sign to hold while I sleep that says &#8220;I AN&#8217;T DEAD&#8221;.)</p>\n<p>My landlady and her sister came by that morning unexpectedly, which was good, because I needed to discuss leaving certain things, like the over the toilet storage unit and the shelving I&#8217;d installed in the bathroom, and some other shelving. I had no use for it and that place really needs storage help, so I figured it would be useful for the new tenant, whoever it turned out to be. Also, I loved living there and wanted to leave things on a good note, which I think I did.</p>\n<p>We finished packing and cleaning, and I had to leave my canning jars behind (which I grabbed on my most recent trip back to Nanaimo &#8212; I lucked out and the sisters were there, painting). But the place was as clean as I could possibly get it, and I&#8217;d even spackled the walls. (<strong>I&#8217;m a damn good spackler</strong>. General handiness sort of runs in my veins, after all.)</p>\n<p>Finally.

(Mind you, I did drive in L.A. itself &#8212; that trip was when I was still learning to drive. But I digress.)</p>\n<p>There are a lot of places in Vancouver and the GVRD that I know. Vaguely. If I end up there, I&#8217;ll say &#8220;OH, I know where we are!&#8221; and then a minute or two later be completely lost again. Or if you asked me about the Front St. and Begbie St. intersection in New West, I can picture it perfectly in my head. Or the Wise Hall on Adanac St. Or Granville Island and Fountain Way. Scott Road and Nordel Way. My friends&#8217; house and driveway in <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through;\">Serial Killer-ville</span> Cloverdale. \u00a0But ask me how to get from point A to point B? Hahahahahahah I don&#8217;t have a <em>fucking clue.</em></p>\n<p><strong>But I am a <em>modern</em> person of genderqueer persuasion! I have a phone with GPS navigation on it, and a very nice British man who can&#8217;t pronounce <em>anything</em> here tells me where to go while I drive.</strong> (For Lougheed, he says &#8220;love-feed&#8221; instead of &#8220;low-heed&#8221;. It&#8217;s <em>hilarious</em> and quite charming.) This has saved my considerably-sized ass multiple times in the past few weeks as I try to navigate this massive collection of cities and neighborhoods. (And I thought <em>Nanaimo</em> was badly designed. Well, okay, <em>it is</em>, but it doesn&#8217;t suffer quite so much sprawl. Or as many idiot and asshole drivers. But I digress again.)</p>\n<p><strong>And truth be told, finding my way around in a city that&#8217;s new to me could be seen as a tremendous adventure as I got lost every few minutes.</strong> I&#8217;d learn each nook and cranny and it would be cemented into my brain as only <em>doing</em> something can. I&#8217;d be quite up for such an adventure if I had gas money to burn. Alas, I don&#8217;t, and so was very glad today that I was in <em>mom&#8217;s</em> car and burning up her gas as I got horribly, terribly lost on my way home.</p>\n<p>For you see, even though my British GPS man is quite helpful to me <em>most</em> of the time, my area of town is currently suffering construction. Specifically the area of town between my house and my boyfriend&#8217;s house, at least on the north-south axis. This is a large section of city, for the record. (The east-west axis of construction is very large too, but I don&#8217;t have any readily-identifiable landmarks to mention.)\u00a0 It seems the GVRD decided that doing construction on EVERY HIGHWAY AT ONCE would be expedient and efficient and not at all frustrating.</p>\n<p>It looks like the <em>Cloverfield</em> monster came and had a tantrum all over our roads. To get anywhere from or to my place I have to navigate a post-apocalyptic wasteland of asphalt and fuckery. <strong>This is the equivalent of my GPS program drinking a <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Zaphod Beeblebrox\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaphod_Beeblebrox\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">Pan-Galactic Gargle Blaster</a> and shitting out its own cerebral cortex.</strong> It starts herping and derping all over the place and says &#8220;Turn left at Shaughnessy Road in 400 metres&#8221; as I&#8217;m sailing <em>through</em> <em>the intersection</em>. And then it cries in a corner, because I scream at it in frustration.</p>\n<p>This construction is expected to last a while. I&#8217;m fairly certain that as soon as I get used to it and know my way around, it&#8217;ll be over, and I&#8217;ll have to relearn everything.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:line-through;\">And then I shall cleanse the GVRD with righteous fire. </span></p>\n<p>So far, though, aside from all the construction fuckery and dealing with assholes on the road, I really like living here. I hope to be less of a shut-in while I live here, and at least go on short walks around the neighborhood. Perhaps that will lead to me actually having something to blog about.</p>\n<p>Part 2, or &#8220;The Stuff I Own Strikes Back&#8221; of The Saga of the Move will be up tomorrow.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://katjevanloon.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/wpid-capture_02.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-2150\" title=\"wpid-capture_02.png\" src=\"https://katjevanloon.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/wpid-capture_02.png?w=49&#038;h=64\" alt=\"\" width=\"49\" height=\"64\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 2208, "location": false, "date": "09-18-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Star Wars", "spinal injury wheeee", "life", "stories: The Jade Star of Athering", "clusterfucks", "Vancouver Island", "Coquitlam", "GVRD", "True Blood", "Doctor Who", "moving", "Pirates and Fairies", "Nanaimo", "Home", "Vancouver", "local"], "text": "<p>(Parts <a title=\"The Saga of the Move: Part 1, or \u201cA New\u00a0Home\u201d\" href=\"http://katjevanloon.com/2012/09/17/the-saga-of-the-move-part-1-or-a-new-home/\">One</a>, <a href=\"http://wp.me/ppYI4-zs\">Two</a>, and <a href=\"http://wp.me/ppYI4-zx\">Three</a>.)</p>\n<p>The worst of this move is over, thankfully. Moving out of a place is a lot harder than moving <em>into</em>. (Also I think there could be a sexual innuendo in that sentence, but I&#8217;m too tired to make it work. Feel free to give it a try in the comments.)</p>\n<p>As soon as I got off the ferry I drove to Pirates and Fairies on Lake Sasamat. I arrived just as the sun was setting, which was around 8 p.m. I&#8217;d missed three meals out of eight of the weekend, as well as my big chance to actually make an announcement about selling my books. I ended up selling exactly zero copies of <em>Bellica</em> or <em>glasstown</em>, which did not help my already pretty sour mood. <strong>Missing half of an event I look forward to all year sucks lizard eggs. </strong></p>\n<p>I was very tired. So tired I spent most of my time sleeping, eating, and frakking (and not as much of that part as usual; <em>that&#8217;s how tired I was</em>). I didn&#8217;t even feel like dressing up, and that&#8217;s one of the parts I look forward to the most &#8212; running around in costume screaming &#8220;ARRRR I BE <strong>GLITTERTITS MCGEE!</strong> PREPARE TA BE <strong><em>BOARDED</em></strong> UNF UNF UNF.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But, you know, it was good. It was a time away from the stress, as much as I can get away from something that follows me like a Time Beetle on my back. It was also lovely because my boyfriend is lovely, and madly in love with me. He saved bacon from Saturday morning for me in the cooler in his cabin. ALL DAY. And he saved me dinner, because he knows how much I love pulled pork. <strong>So when I arrived, I got to stuff my face with meaty goodness that symbolized his deep and abiding love for my crazy ass.</strong> That&#8217;s a pretty awesome thing to arrive to, especially when you&#8217;re an emotional eater. Eating food to symbolize love when that food <em>actually does symbolize real love</em>? Way cheaper than therapy.</p>\n<p>After Pirates and Fairies I went and stayed at his place for four days, after coming by the apartment to spend some time with mom and Tyee. We watched <em>Doctor Who</em> and it was awesome, though Tyee continued to look at us as if we were crazy. When I left, Tyee sulked, because a) I was leaving and b) I was leaving to go see my boyfriend, and Tyee knew it. The dog is still not used to Ogre &#8212; Tyee&#8217;s a rescue and has issues with really big dudes, and Ogre is a living mountain with hands the size of lunchboxes. Ogre makes a sudden movement and Tyee pees himself. This is&#8230;sort of sadly hilarious when you realize that if Tyee jumps up and puts his front paws on Ogre&#8217;s shoulders, they&#8217;re the same height &#8212; and Ogre is six and a half feet tall.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I had to get back to the apartment by Friday so I could be there for the washer and dryer guys from the Brick. I figure, sure, I can do that, no problem. And it wasn&#8217;t a problem getting back. Not really. Except that Ogre works a late shift and so while I was vegging out at his place, I sort of&#8230;shifted to his schedule and started sleeping till four in the afternoon. (He actually gets up earlier than that, but I sleep like the dead.) So on Thursday night I decided to get to sleep for a few hours before he arrived home, and told him via text to wake me up when he was ready to watch some <em>True Blood</em> (I am strangely fascinated with the lives of these incredibly tropey characters, even if one of the gods I worship sort of takes a massive PR beating in Season 2). I was planning on just staying up after we&#8217;d finished watching a few episodes and just driving home.</p>\n<p>This would have worked fine if my body had let me sleep. <strong>I was tired enough to sleep but my body is a jerk and doesn&#8217;t always like to, you know, <em>do stuff I want it to</em>. </strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;Hey, body, can you stop hurting?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;NO. FUCK YOU.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Hey, body, can I sleep now?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;NO. FUCK YOU.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Hey, body, could I get a regular menstrual cycle?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;FUUUUUUUUUUUUCCCCCCKKKKKKKK YYYYYOOOOUUUUUUU.&#8221;</p>\n<p>So I dozed, slightly, but basically didn&#8217;t get any sleep at all. I drove home incredibly tired, got lost and had to u-turn and ended up taking the Port Mann <em>twice</em> which I really have to stop doing if I want to avoid tolls in the near future (it&#8217;s happened to me about six or seven times in the past month; <a title=\"Lost in Coquitlamfield with a drunk\u00a0GPS\" href=\"http://katjevanloon.com/2012/09/18/lost-in-coquitlamfield-with-a-drunk-gps/\">driving in the GVRD is fucked up</a>). \u00a0The message from the Brick on the answering machine said they&#8217;d be there between 9 and 11 am, and it was about 7:30 when I got home.</p>\n<p>I sat on the couch and called my mom and we chatted. I remember hanging up and thinking &#8220;I should get up and do some stuff around the house,&#8221; and then the next thing I knew it was noon and I was waking up from some fucked up dreams. I don&#8217;t even remember lying down, but I woke up in that position on the couch. And the Brick guys had called at about ten after nine.</p>\n<p>I said <em>screw it</em> and crawled into my actual bed, where I slept until 5pm. I had to call the Brick again after I woke up to arrange for them to come again, and it had to wait until the next Friday because I was going to be in Nanaimo again from Saturday to Thursday.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, my massive laundry pile <em>grew</em>. <strong>Like something that evolved out of the depths of a swamp, it grew and grew and grew until it took over my entire apartment and I suffocated.</strong></p>\n<p>I may be exaggerating. But the pile is <em>still growing</em>. Do you know why?</p>\n<p>The guys arrived last Friday (the 14th) to finish the job. They stacked the washer and dryer, so there is now room again in my living room and I no longer feel guilty about not serving an appliance dinner. While stacking the washer and dryer, they said &#8220;So, do you have a vent kit for the dryer?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Uhhhhh. No? Whatever you see there is what we have.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Yeah, they didn&#8217;t sell us a vent kit with the dryer. Apparently it was assumed we had one. The stacking/delivery/hooking up guys were pretty frustrated with that as well, as it&#8217;s something they apparently constantly tell the sales people: &#8220;Ask people if they need a vent kit!&#8221; Because, you know, the average person is <em>not going to think about that</em>.</p>\n<p>Or maybe the average person <em>is</em> going to think about that; I&#8217;m not sure, as I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;m not average.\u00a0 Point being, <em>we</em> didn&#8217;t think about it, and apparently other people don&#8217;t either, and now we had a washer and a dryer and no vent kit which means&#8230;no way to hook up the dryer. (Well, ok, we could have hooked it up and used it, but then lint would have been sprayed all over the house and it is <em>hard enough</em> to keep this place clean, let me tell you.)</p>\n<p>Or the washer, it turns out! Because the hoses, which came in a package, <strong>were missing a clamp</strong>. Some vital piece of metal <em>was not put in the package with them</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Hello, solid wall. I believe you already know my forehead? I think it&#8217;s time you two got re-acquainted. I think you&#8217;ll be great friends.</strong></p>\n<p>I went to my boyfriend&#8217;s place that night, mainly so I could steal the use of his washer and dryer. (And, yeah, <em>True Blood</em> and cuddles were also on the menu. We watched all of Season 3 in two days.) Managed to about halve the pile as it was on Friday, but then I spent this weekend actually unpacking clothing and some were musty enough from being in various suitcases for weeks that they need another wash. So the pile is back to the size it was before I did any wash.</p>\n<p>The washer and dryer guys are coming again at the end of next week &#8212; either the 27th or the 28th, probably the 28th. I&#8217;m hoping this will be the end of it. If this particular clusterfuck gets resolved by then, it will have been <em>over a month getting a new washer and dryer hooked up and working</em>, when it should have happened before I even got here.</p>\n<p><strong>I swear to gods, every single planet is retrograde for me. </strong></p>\n<p>There are a few remaining clusterfucks in this saga, but they don&#8217;t really warrant an entire post to themselves. Basically, a ton of my stuff is still in my friends&#8217; carport in Nanaimo, and I have to make several car trips to get it out of there as soon as possible, because winter&#8217;s coming and carports are not sealed against the elements. Also, don&#8217;t want to overstay my stuff&#8217;s welcome. They do actually need their carport for stuff.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m also struggling to unload my car every time I fill it, which takes me a while because&#8230;yeah, you know the story. I don&#8217;t have to rehash it. LIFTING STUFF HURTS BECAUSE I AM A CRIPPLE. Also I can&#8217;t open jars anymore. I think my muscles atrophied during my narcotics coma this year.</p>\n<p>By the time you read this I will already have gone over to Nanaimo again, taken my grad photos, driven up to Courtenay to grab stuff out of TG&#8217;s broken truck (<em>yes the truck is still in Courtenay being fixed ye gods and little fishies</em>) and caught a ferry to Powell River. Now it&#8217;s unpack-stuff-and-put-into-storage and doctor&#8217;s-appointment time. Then I rush back down to Vancouver so I can take my mom&#8217;s car in to get the odometer fixed or something, I wasn&#8217;t really listening, and wait around for the washer and dryer guys from the Brick to give me working laundry.</p>\n<p>Oh, yeah, and I have to somehow work a million+ hours in the next few weeks so I can make ends meet and pay my rent and stuff.</p>\n<p><strong>This being an adult thing. I do not like it. I would like to return it, please</strong>.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s the story. That&#8217;s the saga of my move. I really hope it&#8217;s over now, at the end of these four posts, just as I only acknowledge 4 <em>Star Wars</em> movies. (The original Trilogy and <em>Revenge of the Sith</em>, because I think he gets points for <em>trying</em>.)</p>\n<p>I am now turning my attention to writing, publishing, and trying to write posts for this blog regularly. I don&#8217;t promise anything on that last front, but <em>The Jade Star of Athering</em> should be out in&#8230;March. Let&#8217;s say March. I had to push the release date by a lot because of this move, so I&#8217;m not cementing any dates yet because <em>all my planets are retrograde</em>.</p>\n<p>Have a lovely weekend, and hopefully I&#8217;ll see y&#8217;all on Monday.</p>\n", "post_id": 2221, "location": false, "date": "09-21-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["life", "Instagram", "nature", "pictures", "photography", "Coquitlam", "Home", "local", "sunrise"], "text": "<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" title=\"IMG_20120918_084626.jpg\" src=\"https://katjevanloon.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/wpid-img_20120918_084626.jpg\" alt=\"image\" /></p>\n<p>This is the view of the sunrise from my balcony.

Click on &#8220;MP Profile&#8221; and it will take you to their profile page, which has all their contact info on it! Super easy, super handy, and I put the link here for you.

Yes, M312 was defeated, and we deserve to drink some champagne or whiskey in celebration, but the fact is 91 of our MPs voted for this bullshit. Ninety-one. That is not a <em>resounding</em> defeat; that is a <em>pretty good</em> defeat, or a <em>meets expectations</em> defeat. We need to do better than that, Canada. <strong>Ninety-one of our MPs voting against the right to choose is ninety-one too many.</strong></p>\n<p>So don&#8217;t hesitate to let your MPs know how you feel. This includes positive feedback &#8212; if they voted against M312, thank them! Let them know how happy you are they supported abortion rights in Canada. That we&#8217;re not taking a step backwards in time, thanks to their action. Especially the Province and Territories who were 100% against the motion (Qu\u00e9bec, Yukon, Northwest Territory, and Nunavut), and the united caucuses of NDP, Bloc Qu\u00e9becois, and Green Party.</p>\n<p><strong>Because the anti-choice jackhats are still out there. Plotting and planning, and if we do not practice constant vigilance they may get a leg up. They already got a foot in the door just by having M312 be introduced in the <em>first</em> place, and the amount of yea votes shows that there is support for that sort of <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">so-out-dated-it&#8217;s-a-goddamn-<em>fossil</em></span> type thinking.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>As it&#8217;s not legal to beat these people to within an inch of their lives or go back in time to abort them, we have to fight in more conventional, less prison-y and/or science-fiction-y ways.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t let them win.

You&#8217;ve been warned.</h4>\n<p>When I chose the current theme for this blog I was in the process of revamping my online presence to better reflect my &#8220;author brand.&#8221; Apparently an author brand is an important thing to have, and I wanted to have one.</p>\n<p>So I chose orange as my go-to color, and it dominates this site and <a href=\"http://gossipdiet.blogspot.com/\">Gossip Diet</a>. I also chose my serious, bookish, I&#8217;m wearing glasses I don&#8217;t actually need and also I&#8217;m upside-down photo as my profile photo for all author-related things. One face, recognizable.</p>\n<p>Recently, I changed that photo to the one of me as <a title=\"Katje: the new\u00a0Starbuck\" href=\"http://katjevanloon.com/meet-katje/\">Starbuck, from Dragon*Con 2008</a>. (More accurately the photo itself is from SeaTac airport on my way to Dragon*Con, but that&#8217;s a sort of useless detail.) Honestly, it better captures <del>the sort of look I want to convey as an author</del> my personality: I drink and swear a lot and can often be seen kicking ass in various ways and screwing up my life in others. <del>Also I&#8217;m dating a Cylon who loves me madly and I probably will never shoot him, no matter what.</del></p>\n<p>Somehow, since that change this blog has felt <em>off.</em> I look at it and I feel dissatisfied. It looks cluttered and too bright and headachey. I want something cleaner.</p>\n<p>I also want to de-clutter some of the crap I have on here. To be perfectly honest, as much as I&#8217;d love to link to other writers in a blogroll it&#8217;s far too much for me to keep up with (because nothing is more annoying than an out-of-date blogroll), and it starts to look unwieldy and daunting in short order. I&#8217;m thinking of scrapping that and several other things altogether.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been browsing themes and trying to find one that fits. I&#8217;m even considering one-column themes, which is a major change for me.</p>\n<p>The overall point of this post? Expect this blog to look completely different by Sunday, and don&#8217;t be surprised if it tries on a few different themes between now and then. I&#8217;m hoping the change will inspire me to blog more often. Just as I need a good notebook and pen with which to write in meatspace, I need my blog to look right for writing online. <del>Because I&#8217;m crazy, that&#8217;s why.</del></p>\n<p>And, you know, there&#8217;s a lesson for me here. The lesson is that there was a good reason the idea of an &#8220;author brand&#8221; felt wrong to me from the beginning. That reason is that I&#8217;m constantly shedding my skin, and choosing any one image or color or signature to represent me for my whole career is fundamentally dishonest to who I am.</p>\n<p>To that end, my author brand must be me. Whomever I choose to be at that moment. I&#8217;m forever re-resurrecting myself in search of truth, just like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_Three_%28Battlestar_Galactica%29\">Number Three/D&#8217;anna</a>.</p>\n<p>The other lesson here is that everything can be related back to <em>Battlestar Galactica</em>.

This isn&#8217;t a reflection on Basta&#8217;s writing; it&#8217;s a reflection on my very slow reading rate. I&#8217;m terrible at finishing books quickly. <a title=\"The Saga of the Move: Part 1, or \u201cA New\u00a0Home\u201d\" href=\"http://katjevanloon.com/2012/09/17/the-saga-of-the-move-part-1-or-a-new-home/\">Especially when I&#8217;m moving</a>.</p>\n<p>I thoroughly enjoyed <em>Revolutionary Right</em> and dove right into the next one, <em>A Little Rebellion</em>. Life has unfortunately been ridiculously busy this month (I&#8217;ve spent all of six nights in my new place), so I haven&#8217;t had much time to sit down and read. I&#8217;ve been reading the Kindle edition while traveling on the ferries, if I haven&#8217;t been napping in my car, and when I&#8217;m home I read the hardcopy.</p>\n<p><strong>Mild spoilers ahead.</strong></p>\n<p>If you go read that first post I linked, which is Wayne&#8217;s stop at Bacon and Whiskey on his tour, you can see why he chose <em>Aristeia</em> as the title for his series. I&#8217;ll quote the pertinent part below for those of you who are browsing this on your phone.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Aristeia (Greek): is a scene in the dramatic conventions of such works as the Iliad in which a hero in battle has his finest moments</p></blockquote>\n<p>So each book follows the <em>aristeia</em> of a particular character. The first book follows Maarkean Ocaitchi&#8217;s <em>aristeia</em> as he decides to rebel against the Alliance and finds out he&#8217;s not as patriotic as he thought. He got into this business of outright rebellion because his sister was in prison, and he wanted to bust her out. Then the Alliance pushes down hard against its citizens, and disbands planetary governments &#8212; which is not legal, or just, and Maark flips his shit. By which I mean he says &#8220;Oh, that is <em>IT,&#8221;</em> and becomes fully committed to the cause of rebellion.</p>\n<p>The second book follows the path of Maarkean&#8217;s sister, Saracasi Ocaitchi, as she decides what sort of person she wants to be: idealist or revolutionary; peaceful or warlike.</p>\n<p>I haven&#8217;t finished it yet, and I can honestly say I don&#8217;t know what path Saracasi will take &#8212; it&#8217;s obvious she&#8217;s committed to the cause, but she may decide to help in a background sort of role by building ships for the rebel army. I&#8217;m intrigued to find out what she chooses, and I also want to see where her fledgling romance with Asirzi goes.</p>\n<p>This book, and the one before it, has a good cast of characters. They&#8217;re complex, <em>real</em> people &#8212; nothing is black and white. There are characters who are truly committed to the cause of the rebellion, and there are characters who are in it because their friends or family are, and loyalty is enough of a reason. I love the developing bromance between Maarkean and Zeric Dustlighter, and how oblivious each man can be while still being an effective leader. Gu&#8217;od and Gamaly are definitely in my list of favorite fictional married couples.</p>\n<p>Finally, each book passes the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechdel_test\">Bechdel test</a>, which is important. (Yes, alien females count as females if that alien species is binary-gendered, or has a gender system that includes <em>female</em> as a gender. This is according to the rules I just made up.) There is a meaningful presence of women in the story &#8212; even when the main character of the first book is Maarkean, and a good portion of <em>Revolutionary Right</em> follows him and Zeric. In my opinion, <a href=\"http://thelivingnotebook.wordpress.com/2012/08/05/does-your-writing-pass-the-bechdel-test/\">passing the Bechdel test is the mark of a thoughtful storyteller who values the presence of women</a>. So long as we live in a culture that continually centers men&#8217;s voices, experiences, and lives, while pushing women to the margins, the importance of the Bechdel test cannot be understated.</p>\n<p><strong>If you like science-fiction that&#8217;s fun, exciting, and isn&#8217;t afraid to explore the ideas of democracy, rebellion, and justice in an oppressive society, then you&#8217;ll like Basta&#8217;s <em>Aristeia</em> series.

The positives outweighed the negatives. Or they <em>didn&#8217;t,</em> and I&#8217;m just in a place in my life where the positives have more of an effect on me than the negatives do. Friday was my first Zoloft day after a week without, because I&#8217;d run out of my first month of pills. That may have something to do with it.</p>\n<p>But it wiped me out. I slept for twelve hours today. I got nothing done when I did wake up, because I was tired enough to go back to sleep. And I had weird dreams. The only one I really remember in any detail involved my boyfriend driving my car, which would never happen because it&#8217;s too small for him. The car was FULL of my stuff, which is basically still true because moving never ends, and we were on the highway and he was bitching about really needing to go to the bathroom. I finally convinced him to pull over so he could relieve himself by the side of the road, and while he did that, some weird dude came up to the car and started trying to open doors to steal my stuff. <strong>So I got out of the car and beat him to death with my cane.</strong></p>\n<p>And then I woke up and discovered <strong>I</strong> had to pee. Funny how our brains work.</p>\n<p>On Friday, my car broke down, I slipped and fell, torquing my back out of alignment even more, and then twisted my ankle later on in the evening &#8212; it <em>still</em> hurts &#8212; and in general I was already feeling crappy physically and emotionally, because a). <strong>whoever designed the human body so that <em>some</em> humans will have terrible pain and cramps and bloating and general feeling-like-shit once a month or thereabouts and some humans will <em>not</em> is the DEVIL</strong>, and b). there will always be people on the internet who will piss me off and/or trigger me.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, I did have a pretty good day on Friday, despite all that. I saw the 200th show put on by Screaming Chickens Theatrical Society, which was a Taboo Revue &#8212; a night of burlesque. There were a few things in the show that really bugged me (a sideshow portion that involved something that&#8217;s probably really not good for other former cutters to watch, and one of the new dancers has a name that includes an anti-trans* slur that&#8217;s also been reclaimed by many trans* people &#8212; but I have no idea if he&#8217;s trans* or not, so there are some complicated emotions there for me), but overall I had a really good time. I got to wear my fancy gold dress, and some fancy gold makeup. Any day I can do that is a good day.</p>\n<p>I also sold a book! I brought along a copy of <em>Bellica</em> on a whim, thinking I&#8217;d maybe show it to one of my burlesque friends. And Star Buxom, who is one of the most amazing burlesque performers I&#8217;ve ever seen and a really incredible person all around, bought it! The best part? <strong>I got to sign it using her back as a table.</strong> I feel like a big-time star author now.</p>\n<p>Afterwards, Ogre took me out to dinner at Denny&#8217;s. This was probably the best part of the evening, because I got to build my own burger. That&#8217;s right &#8212; <strong>Denny&#8217;s now has a <em>build your own burger</em> option</strong>. I got to have two types of cheese, bacon, onions, lettuce, and sour cream on a burger. On potato bread. With <em>no</em> tomatoes or pickles. It was magically delicious. They even let me name it, and I told Ogre we have to name one of our kids after this magical, beautiful burger.</p>\n<p>I called it <strong><a href=\"http://www.tvfanatic.com/2011/03/archer-review-placebo-effect/\">Burger of Enrampagement</a>.</strong></p>\n<p>I regret nothing.</p>\n<p>Anyway.</p>\n<p>Today I spent recouping <a href=\"http://www.butyoudontlooksick.com/articles/written-by-christine/the-spoon-theory/\">spoons</a>, and I&#8217;ll probably spend a good portion of tomorrow doing that too.

Never before the moment<br />\nwhen I first came into the full realization of its implications can I recall feeling disgusted by a linguistic<br />\nconcept. Since then a few others have crept in, but that one has always stood above all as a foreboding<br />\nbastion of ignorance, arrogance, and conceit.</p>\n<p>You see, <em>these days</em> and other expressions like it are used, almost exclusively, to draw a spurious<br />\ndistinction between past and present, usually to the great deteriment of the latter. It is a phrase which<br />\nis characterized by the cherry-picking of half-baked facts, the use of unapologetically fallacious logic<br />\nto support conclusions drawn in advance, and above all else by an emotional approach to reality not<br />\ngrounded in the concrete.</p>\n<p>In short, <em>these days</em> requires something which is not true: It requires that human experience, being a<br />\nfunction of human nature, must change fundamentally over time. I have, in some ways, made it my<br />\nlife\u2019s work to combat <em>these days</em>, having written a string of stories demonstrating the universality of<br />\nhuman experience across not just time but also space and culture, and yet when one writes something<br />\nlike a \u201cRomance for the Digital Age\u201d the question one is expected to answer is, \u201cwhat\u2019s going on <em>these</em><br />\n<em>days</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>And the truth is, there are observable differences between what happens <em>these days</em> and what<br />\nhappened 20 years ago, let alone 200 years ago. Things are not, at a superficial level, the same. Texts<br />\ntake the place of phone calls, phone calls take the place of visits, camwhoring takes the place of good ol\u2019<br />\nfashioned stripping. Yet what one must ask oneself, what one must write with dedication and verve to<br />\nconclude, is whether or not these sorts of changes actually <em>matter.</em> Need we create an \u2018other\u2019 of those<br />\nborn after us, attempt to draw distinctions between our experiences of the world rather than drawing<br />\nparallels?</p>\n<p>We needn\u2019t, and we musn\u2019t. We are not served by doing so, and so in the pursuit not just of truth,<br />\nreason, and logic, which I assure you all lie in contradiction to <em>these days</em>, but also in the pursuit of<br />\nthe pleasure of being closer to those we are meant to care for, we must all strive to eliminate <em>these</em><br />\n<em>days</em> from our thinking, to quash the logical fallacy which is threatening to strangle intergenerational<br />\ncommunication and impair the proper understanding of history.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Gabriel\u2019s new book, <em>Rmnce,</em> hits digital shelves October 1st!

Or perhaps more accurately, it does not appear to be your traditional love story. It is written entirely through the communications of the couple. Text messages, emails, and even a few old-fashioned letters make up the entirety of a story, what one early reader termed &#8220;A story not so much written as formed organically in the negative space.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It is, in short, a commentary on love in the digital age, a tribute to the great love affairs of the digital generation, romance not lost in the sea of text-speak and instant gratification, but merely obscured from the prying eyes of those too far removed from its cultural roots.</p></blockquote>\n", "post_id": 2523, "location": false, "date": "10-06-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Oma", "knitting", "family", "food and drink", "tea", "Coquitlam", "sex", "haunting", "Home", "ghosts"], "text": "<p>I cannot describe to you the <em>panic</em> I just had.</p>\n<p>It was heart-attack inducing.

It brings together passionate, quality self-published writers to help each other promote their work, bringing more readers to every member. It was sparked by the simple fact that there are many top quality self-published authors being over-looked because they do not have the time and resources to efficiently and effectively market and promote themselves.

There&#8217;s also many people on the internet, particularly some webcomics, who took that plunge to pursue their dream careers.<br />\n<h4> If you could select one book that you could rewrite and add your own unique twist on, which book would that be and why?</h4>\n<p>None. Any book I&#8217;ve liked there&#8217;s nothing about them that I would change. They may have some flaws, but everything does. If I were to mess with them, I know I&#8217;d ultimately ruin their greatness. There are plenty of books I haven&#8217;t liked that could stand to be rewritten, but if I didn&#8217;t like a book I tend to forget about it. \u00a0 </p>\n<p>Now, there are quite a few movies and tv shows I&#8217;d love to redo.<br />\n<h4> Do you have any special routines or rituals?</h4>\n<p>Depends on what you mean by special <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile' title=':-)'>:-)</span>. For my writing, I don&#8217;t like big outlines, they just don&#8217;t work for me. The story needs to be able to evolve naturally. But I do find it helpful to do a daily outline for what I&#8217;m going to write during a particular day. <br />\n<h4> What is something people would be surprised to know about you?</h4>\n<p>I&#8217;ve watched, and enjoyed the entire series of the <i>Sopranos</i> but I&#8217;ve never seen the <i>Godfather</i>. <br />\n<h4> Say your publisher has offered to fly you anywhere in the world to do research on an upcoming book, where would you most likely want to go?</h4>\n<p>Caribbean. \u00a0One idea for my next series is a fantasy pirate adventure. So naturally I would need to visit a lot of tropical beaches. For research. <br />\n<h4> Does your significant other read your stuff?</h4>\n<p>Sometimes. She read my first novel and critiqued it. But when I was ready for her to read the second one she was 8 months pregnant and a little distracted. <br />\n<h4> Do you listen to music while writing? If so what?</h4>\n<p>Depends on my mood and the scene I&#8217;m working on. Sometimes I just want some good classic rock or some 80&#8217;s/90&#8217;s music that I grew up with in the back ground, other times I want a good exciting film score to help move an action scene along. But I often write in silence to help myself stay focused. <br />\n<h4> What are the most important attributes for remaining sane as a writer?</h4>\n<p>Accept the fact that you&#8217;re going to have to throw a lot of your work away. It can be tough to do, especially if it&#8217;s something you&#8217;ve put a lot of time and effort in. But if it&#8217;s not working, it&#8217;s not working and sometimes the only way to fix it is to start from scratch. </p>\n<h3> \u00a0About <i>Aristeia: A Little Rebellion</i></h3>\n<p><i>Unlike her brother, Saracasi Ocaitchi has always known that her  loyalties belong to the ideals of freedom and democracy, not the  government of the Alliance, and that protecting those ideals would  require a fight.

So I quit and promptly forgot my login information.</p>\n<p>Well, someone very special to me currently plays it, and has been hinting for a while that I should too, namely by copy-pasting funny bits from the Wiki or the game in Skype chats.

(Or, okay, well, <em>my </em>traditional day for Beltane.)</p>\n<p>In the Neo-Wiccan Wheel of the Year, Beltane is one of eight sabbats (solar festivals; the others are the solstices, equinoxes, Imbolc, Lughnasadh, and Samhain). It is based off older traditions from various parts of Europe and the British Isles, but its modern-day celebrations are a mishmash of these traditions. Like Wicca, today&#8217;s Neo-Pagan Beltane is new.</p>\n<p>Celebrations of Beltane can include jumping the fire for fertility (of any sort; not just baby-making), dancing around the May-pole (which, yes, is supposed to be a phallus), making lewd motions with ritual implements (or perhaps that&#8217;s just me), candy shaped like genitalia, getting married or handfasted for a year and a day, and unbridled coupling in the woods. Or your bedroom; whatevs.</p>\n<p><strong>Beltane is also known as <em>the sex holiday</em>, and for good reason.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>For me personally, Beltane is sacred to Morrigan, who is so much more than a &#8220;goddess of war and death&#8221;. She&#8217;s the goddess of sovereignty, which is inherently tied up with sexuality and being a warrior. (For more on my take on the Morrigan and many other topics related to paganism, check out my writings under the name <a href=\"http://innocenceandimmanence.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Morag Spinner at Innocence and Immanence</a>.)</p>\n<p>Also, the sex celebrated at Beltane is, to me, more than just what I do with my boyfriend (though that is <em>quite awesome</em>, don&#8217;t get me wrong). If you were to ask me to define &#8220;The Force&#8221; or the divine source of life pulsing through the universe, I would say &#8220;sex&#8221;. Sex is what makes us; sex continues the cycle of life. The earth is teeming with the life force, and it&#8217;s inherently sexual &#8212; if you do energy work, you may know what I mean. There&#8217;s a thrill that comes with <em>really great connection</em> during ritual or magic.</p>\n<p><strong>What am I doing for Beltane this year? </strong></p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll be doing a small ritual re-affirming my bond with the Morrigan and re-opening my connection to the land and its life-force. I&#8217;ll also be writing, hard at work on <em>The Jade Star of Athering</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>If you want to do something to commemorate the day</strong> but you&#8217;re not sure where to start, you could <strong>consider downloading <em>Bellica</em> on the Kindle.</strong> Today is the <strong>last promo day</strong> for <em>Bellica</em>, and it&#8217;s full of pretty sexy prose. (Check out my <a href=\"http://gossipdiet.blogspot.ca/search/label/SFFSat\" target=\"_blank\">SSFSat snippets</a> if you don&#8217;t believe me.)

They didn&#8217;t listen very well, but I don&#8217;t expect them to.</p>\n<p>Then on Sunday I did things. I was generally productive. My boyfriend came to visit me and we got to watch some TV together, because I was feeling well enough to sit up for a little while. It was a fairly good day.</p>\n<p>Today I got around all day without the walker. A big feat, considering I had to go get bloodwork done at a lab and then went to physiotherapy (which was nice, though a bit tough at points). And then I walked back to the apartment after physio. (It&#8217;s across the street.)</p>\n<p>I was upset on Saturday, and I had every right to be. You see, I&#8217;ve never been young. Well. I&#8217;ve been young, but I&#8217;ve never felt physically young. And I&#8217;ve suffered enough emotional traumas to age me prematurely, so I&#8217;ve never felt mentally young, either. I&#8217;ve never fit in with my peers &#8212; never understood them, or been able to relate to them. What has seemed important to them has always baffled me.</p>\n<p>My obesity started when I was a young child, and it complicated health problems already extant. My inability to stay healthy continued my downward spiral, and as a consequence I&#8217;ve never felt like a young person in this body. I&#8217;ve never felt that youthful joy, that energy, that feeling of immortality. I&#8217;ve always felt older than I am.</p>\n<p>I sort of had this dream of getting healthy, presumably losing some weight, though perhaps not all of it, and then becoming young. I had this dream that I&#8217;d get healthy and then finally be able to do all those really spontaneous things that young people do: sky-diving, maybe, or a four-day hike through the wilderness. Maybe I&#8217;d take up street hockey, or horseback riding. All those physical things, those things that make it a joy to be in your body, those things I&#8217;d never really enjoyed before because it was <em>exercise</em> and <em>exercise</em> has always been tainted in my mind by both emotional trauma and the fact that it&#8217;s difficult for me to do.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m fat-positive, and I do believe in HAES. But the fact is, my body is not healthy at this size and it never has been. I felt much better when I was 60 pounds lighter. My frame operates better when there is less adipose tissue weighing it down.</p>\n<p>Now, my discs are bulging.</p>\n<p>And what that means is that my dream of being a young person is gone. I&#8217;m not being overly-dramatic here &#8212; I have to be careful. I&#8217;m forever that unfun friend with the back issues, who has to constantly be on guard lest she injure herself doing something <em>completely normal</em> that everyone else can handle. And the thing is, even though I had my issues, I tried to never let anything get in the way of <em>doing things</em>.</p>\n<p>Which is possibly what led me to this predicament.</p>\n<p>So no, I&#8217;m not going to be fun, spontaneous Katje anymore, and I&#8217;m never going to be able to feel that youthful immortality. Which, perhaps, is better for me in the long run &#8212; but at the moment I&#8217;m having trouble seeing the bright side.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m trying to be optimistic, though. I&#8217;m looking at what I can do.</p>\n<p>I can go jogging (once I&#8217;ve lost some more weight, and once the back is healed). I can take up boxing. I can probably do some forms of martial arts. I can write, I can paint, I can sing, I can dance burlesque. I can go swimming. I can canoe and kayak. I&#8217;m going to have to be careful doing some of these things, but ok &#8212; that&#8217;s my new reality, now, and the point is I can do them in the first place. They&#8217;re not completely stricken from my list of options.</p>\n<p>And I have to force myself to be optimistic. To be happy with what I can do. Because I&#8217;m basically a cat declawed, and there&#8217;s no going back from that.</p>\n", "post_id": 2577, "location": false, "date": "01-31-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["writing", "Ixchel", "characters: Bellica Agate"], "text": "<p>This is an excerpt from <em>The Jade Star of Athering</em>, a sequel to <em>Dead Transgressions</em> set 10,000 years later and right after the events in <em>Bellica</em>.</p>\n<p>Bellica Agate has been ordered to travel to Southland to negotiate with the army of Gypsies and their Queen that have laid siege to the province.\u00a0 She decides to pray at the temple before leaving.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><p>Ixchel had no temples, no buildings of stone or wood; She did not even have a place in the services offered at the Temple.

On Thursday I had really bad back pain and tried to sleep it off; by Friday it was worse. My mom came for a visit on Friday evening. I was incapacitated so we called the nursing hotline. Because I had tingling and numbness and because I&#8217;d spent an hour on the floor at some point that day, crying, unable to get up (until I finally did force myself to do it, through the pain, which may have injured my back further but godsdammit I had to pee) the nursing hotline suggested that I get medical attention right away, because otherwise my condition would only get worse.</p>\n<p>Now. What exactly my condition is I don&#8217;t know, for shortly after the call with the nursing hotline we called the ambulance, because I couldn&#8217;t get out to the car to get to the hospital, and the paramedics couldn&#8217;t get a gurney through the snow of my backyard or into my hobbit hole of a home, and so they doped me up on laughing gas so I could walk, supported, out into the ambulance. <strong>The gas made me sound like Darth Vader at a comedy club.</strong> I apparently waltzed past 4 firemen in my underwear and didn&#8217;t even notice. Mind you, that sort of <em>meh</em> feeling towards modesty wouldn&#8217;t have changed without the laughing gas; if I were sober I merely would have made awesome comments about the situation instead of giggling like a mad fool.</p>\n<p>And so I was marched into an ambulance and driven to the emerge. at Nanaimo Gen., where I was wheeled in a very uncomfortable wheelchair into the building and then, shortly, into a treatment room. <strong>The doctor did a brief brusque physical exam and decided it was muscle strain before instructing a nurse to shoot me up with some painkillers.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>I tried to tell him, as did my mother, that I have 15 years of chronic back pain and it&#8217;s possible it&#8217;s more than just a muscle strain; that we&#8217;d like more tests run. Nothing doing. He wouldn&#8217;t even listen.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>I ended up lying down on the table in the treatment room, dozing, trying to forget the pain (which the painkillers had only dulled) while my mom sat in the chair and dozed herself.

The bathroom was only a few feet away from the treatment room and so mom helped me up and helped me walk to the bathroom door&#8230;</p>\n<p>&#8230;at which point my back seized up and I could go no further, and the pain started gripping me harshly, and mom started calling for help and we were steadily ignored until I started screaming, because the pain was so bad, and then a nurse was grabbing me on the underside of my upper arm, on the bat wing, harshly &#8212; so harshly I felt sure he would rip off a chunk of my flesh or at least leave a bruise &#8212; telling me to shut up because there were other patients.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know what happened after that, because the next thing I knew I was on the floor, with a major ache in my skull and people all around me yelling.<br />\n<strong></strong><br />\n<strong>It is terrifying to wake up and not know who you are, where you are, how you came to be there, or anything else except people are yelling at you about something and your throat is very, very raw and you have the vague memory of someone screaming.</strong></p>\n<p>That&#8217;s exactly what happened to me that night. I fainted and cracked my head on the floor &#8212; the acts thereof I don&#8217;t remember, but the aftermath I do. The screaming apparently didn&#8217;t stop until right before I woke up.</p>\n<p>The hospital staff that helped me up and into a wheelchair <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">didn&#8217;t check out my obvious concussion</span>. They made accusatory statements of &#8220;what was she doing up in the first place?&#8221; and they shot me full of morphine, ostensibly to shut me up.</p>\n<p>I got sat in the TV room, where I vomited seven times and pissed myself. Mom tried to get us admitted, only to be informed that we&#8217;d been discharged over two hours ago. Finally she decided to go home and get the car so she could take me to Coquitlam, across the water, to stay bedridden in my grandparents&#8217; old apartment that has elevators, wheelchairs, a shower with a chair, and a hot tub if wanted. Much safer than my place or mom&#8217;s.</p>\n<p>A little while before she came back a nurse came and wheeled me out of the TV room, where it was calm enough for me to subdue my nausea, making some comments about how my mom should have been back already and what was she doing that was taking so long? While I responded about the snow (&#8220;All the snow&#8217;s gone!&#8221; &#8220;Not in Harewood,&#8221;) he wheeled me out into the main waiting room, where two TV screens and people chatting started the nausea flare up again.

I am lying flat and typing because I cannot sit, or type in any other lying down position that I&#8217;ve found works for me. I am on three different prescriptions &#8212; two heavy-duty painkillers and one heavy-duty muscle relaxant &#8212; that are supposed to help my body fix itself. Needless to say <strong>I am seeking a second opinion from a doctor who&#8217;s more competent and who also will not treat me like a hysterical fat girl seeking attention</strong>, which is the attitude I got from the doctor and nurses at Nanaimo Gen.</p>\n<p>I may be fat, but I&#8217;m not hysterical or a girl and I get quite enough attention already, thank you very much. I have real, chronic back pain, and the pain went from an 11 at home to a 16 right before I fainted (for the second time in my entire life). And, surprisingly enough, <strong>getting treated like subhuman by the medical establishment doesn&#8217;t actually do anything towards solving my health issues.\u00a0 </strong></p>\n<p>As I said. I&#8217;m mildly concussed and it should be the least of my worries. But it&#8217;s not. Because now my head is so foggy I sometimes forget the most basic of basics &#8212; names, places, whos hows whens wheres whats and whys &#8212; and I&#8217;ve got ringing and partial deafness in my left ear and a massive, tender bump on the back of my head.</p>\n<p><strong>And I&#8217;ve had precisely <em>zero</em> medical attention paid to this concussion. This concussion that I sustained while being treated like a &#8220;hysterical female&#8221; in a medical establishment. </strong></p>\n<p>So, as it is, I&#8217;m most pissed off about the concussion. Because being ignored in cases of extreme pain is sort of the norm for me now; <em>I&#8217;m used to the medical est. ignoring everything a fat person says because zie&#8217;s fat.</em> But the concussion happened on their watch and it is fucking up my ability to think and speak and write &#8212; and being as incapacitated as I am, that&#8217;s all I have fucking left. <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Is my brain and the internet.</span></p>\n<p>And now one is broken, which makes it vastly difficult to use the other one.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "post_id": 2584, "location": false, "date": "01-24-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["NaNo2011", "settings: Harbourtown"], "text": "<p>From my Nanowrimo novel, <em>Dead Transgressions</em>.</p>\n<p>Adrasteia, the half-Atherian, half-Ixilean hero, is currently visiting Harbourtown with Duke Leandros of Aeril, the brother of the woman she&#8217;s sworn to protect from a plot by the Children of IxChel, intent on reclaiming their people&#8217;s Jade Star.

Over the years, many books and writers have been banned or challenged \u2014 for political reasons or just some vague feeling of \u201cneeding to protect the children\u201d.</p>\n<p>Until this year, I\u2019d never sought to read a banned book. Then I decided I\u2019d try and find one, and saw on the list of top ten challenged books for 2010 were two books I\u2019d already read this week \u2014 <em>The Hunger Games</em> by Suzanne Collins and <em>The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian</em> by Sherman Alexie. I\u2019d picked these up because I\u2019m on a bit of a YA bent right now, and because I\u2019m a First Nations major who had the privilege of seeing Alexie speak at a conference several years ago.</p>\n<p>What\u2019s amazing is the amount of YA novels that get banned or challenged. We feel that <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303657404576357622592697038.html\">we must protect children and teenagers</a> from darkness, danger, naughty words. The fact is most kids these days already live in hell, and <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2011/06/09/why-the-best-kids-books-are-written-in-blood/\">as Sherman Alexie says</a>, those dark, dark books give them weapons with which to fight for their lives.</p>\n<p>When I was 11 I was sneaking booze from my dad\u2019s liquor cabinet. By the time I was 15 I had already tried to kill myself numerous times. When I was 18 and my mom sent me to get tested for diabetes (it runs in my family and I was showing symptoms), the doctor asked me what I would have done <em>had</em> I tested positive.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d probably just let it kill me,\u201d I said, completely serious.</p>\n<p>He said he was going to recommend me to a therapist, and I said that was probably a good idea.</p>\n<p>Eventually I got onto anti-depressants, and then I got off them for a while, and continued in my deep spiral of depression. I was living in the States, under-age, and drinking a case of Smirnoff Twists every other night, taking pain pills along with it hoping to slip into a coma while I slept (I just woke up in the middle of the night with a headache and needing to piss like a racehorse). I would drive my car fast on dark, curvy roads, hoping to lose control at the right moment. I cut myself a lot and screamed out my anguish.</p>\n<p>Moving back home to Canada helped, but not much. It was legal for me to drink here, so my problem just intensified. I careened from one bad relationship to another and began to believe that I deserved the abuses they dealt out.</p>\n<p>In June of last year I decided I was tired of <em>wanting to die all the time</em>, and went to my doctor and said \u201cI need help.\u201d She put me on pills which balanced me and stopped my drinking habit. Three months later I met the love of my life, and finally realized that I deserved to be loved and cherished.</p>\n<p>I can now honestly say it\u2019s been a year and four months since I thought about committing suicide, and even longer since I\u2019ve attempted it (directly, at least \u2014 a year and a half ago I was still trying to drink myself to death). While I sometimes say, tongue-in-cheek, that life would be easier if I just offed myself \u2014 that is an example of dark wit in the face of crippling debt and chronic illness, self-hatred and despair.</p>\n<p>So, I\u2019m sorry, but just where were these people who so desperately wanted to \u201cprotect\u201d me when I was enduring the horrors that led to this sort of depression? They want to ban books that may give me hope, because heavens forfend I read about kids overcoming insurmountable obstacles, about how friendship can get you through anything, about how it\u2019s okay to be a smart girl, about a parent\u2019s divorce not being the end of the world, about fighting off myriad enemies with only your wits and luck to guide you.</p>\n<p>Now I read YA books and think \u201cI hope that somewhere, a kid with the same crippling despair I felt is reading this and thinking life is worth living, if only for a little while longer.\u201d</p>\n<p>Because life <em>is</em> worth living. I am so happy my suicide attempts all failed, because no matter how bad the economy is (I still haven\u2019t paid all of September\u2019s rent), no matter how dark things look \u2014 my life is better now. In ways I couldn\u2019t have imagined when I was 11, 15, 18, even 23. Books gave me weapons. Many of the ones I read that helped me have been challenged enough times to make the list, because they\u2019re \u201cdangerous\u201d for kids to read.</p>\n<p>The only thing that\u2019s dangerous is for kids to <em>stop</em> reading.</p>\n<p>Had I stopped reading\u2026well, I may not be here today. Reading gave me courage, hope, and the strength to see it through to the end. It\u2019s not the end yet, and I\u2019m not going anywhere.</p>\n<p><strong>For Banned Books Week, pick up a YA book that\u2019s been challenged. It shouldn\u2019t be hard; they\u2019re everywhere.

Would be so easy if I could just call Milla Jovovich up, but she doesn&#8217;t know me. (Yet.)</li>\n<li>I will probably be volunteering at the Vancouver International Writer&#8217;s Festival. You should come by and say hi to me. (I cannot tell you where I&#8217;ll be, but you should recognize me &#8212; I&#8217;m pretty distinctive. Fat with short blond hair.

My Nano novel is <em>The Jade Star of Athering</em>, which is the sequel to <em>Bellica</em>, and it&#8217;s coming along fairly nicely. As it&#8217;s my second novel in that world and set right after the events in <em>Bellica</em> I&#8217;m having trouble separating the two; I have to remember to make it enjoyable as a standalone as well as a sequel, because I would hate to be one of<em> those</em> writers. You know the kind I&#8217;m talking about.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m also trying to make my main character much different from Yarrow, but it is difficult because she is around the same age, a bellica, and &#8212; of course &#8212; is the HEROINE. There are going to be similarities.</p>\n<p>What I find helpful is to compare my characters to characters in movies or TV &#8212; specifically <em>Battlestar Galactica</em>, because the show is basically religion to me. Yarrow was very Starbuckian*; I&#8217;m trying to make Bellica Agate more like Kendra Shaw. Very reserved, sober, disciplined &#8212; but she has her dark, dirty secrets.</p>\n<p>(If you don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m talking about, GO WATCH <em>BATTLESTAR GALACTICA</em> RIGHT NOW.

It&#8217;s fucking fantastic.)</p>\n<p>Then come the other problems &#8212; while editing <em>Bellica</em> I noticed a lot of devices that I used and reused and reused until I and my beta readers committed mass suicide (mmm Koolaid). Since then I&#8217;ve been consciously trying to NOT use those devices so much, and it slows down the flow. I know the point of Nano is not to edit as you go, but I really, really can&#8217;t help it. It&#8217;s like cooking &#8212; clean the kitchen as you go; make it a habit and your kitchen will forever glisten. (I don&#8217;t actually do this, but the analogy sticks. Because I don&#8217;t use Pam.)</p>\n<p>Also I can&#8217;t continue writing until I have a name for someone or something, because the person&#8217;s character is tied to the name &#8212; AND the name has to be meaningful. Really awesome when the subject of your book is a totally new culture that you haven&#8217;t had a chance to research properly &#8212; that is, it&#8217;s a made-up culture BASED in the Mayan culture. So I want it as true to life as possible, meaning I&#8217;m not just going to make up Mayan <em>sounding</em> names, but actually composite new names based off the real words in Maya.</p>\n<p>Which Maya? GOOD QUESTION. I&#8217;m calling the people the Pokomam, which is a kind of Maya, but that&#8217;s not necessarily what I&#8217;m basing it off.</p>\n<p>Oh, and I need to devise a Mayan calendar for a different world 20,000 years in the future.</p>\n<p>So my flow is not fresh. It is stumbly and blocked. But at least it&#8217;s moving.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As for Get Your Words Out I&#8217;m at <strong>154,984</strong>. If I finish NaNo at just 50K I&#8217;ll need to pound out 10K in December. Which is fine; I&#8217;ll be doing NaNoFiMo most likely.

It&#8217;ll be a bit more difficult.</p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s worth it to avoid the gauge swatch, in my totally-not-humble-at-all opinion.

I personally want a hole in the top of my hat so I can have a place for the extra crazy to escape from my brain.)</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll post more pictures when it&#8217;s done.

Because he knows it&#8217;s important for me to acknowledge my Yank heritage. (Also, more excuses for turkey.)</p>\n<p>Yesterday, we had dinner together, watched <em>Grimm,</em> and ate pumpkin pie with (real!) whipped cream.</p>\n<p>And <em>then</em> we had dessert. *lewd wink*</p>\n<p>Tomorrow, he comes over to my place, we have dinner together, watch <em>True Blood</em>, and do something else. Perhaps <em>dessert</em>-related.</p>\n<p>Who needs a massive dinner that takes a lot of energy to cook when you have such awesome mini-celebrations to experience? Seriously, this weekend is going <em>great.</em> <strong>I can&#8217;t really ask for anything more.</strong></p>\n<p>(Ok, I can. I can ask for the energy to actually finish re-organizing my bookshelves and get some writing done today. There. It&#8217;s asked for. And the Universe shall provide.)</p>\n<p>Now, what I <em>didn&#8217;t</em> do in this post is list what I&#8217;m grateful for, but I don&#8217;t think I <em>need</em> to. It&#8217;s sort of obvious. <strong>I&#8217;m grateful for my boyfriend, my family, all the people in my life who have stuck by me</strong>, because &#8212; let&#8217;s be honest &#8212; I&#8217;m <em>not</em> an easy person to stick by for the long haul. People prefer to sprint friendship with me, so for every long-distance runner around &#8212; <strong>thanks.</strong></p>\n<p>And obviously I&#8217;m grateful for my incredible writing talent, and <a href=\"http://kaimanawolff.com/\">the person I got it from</a> (that&#8217;s my mom, in case you&#8217;re wondering). I&#8217;m thankful for a house that&#8217;s warm, and knitting, and bacon, and trees and hats and Nutella and my dog, Tyee. I&#8217;m thankful for my education and my computers and my cane and my strength. I&#8217;m thankful for my small following here at Bacon and Whiskey, and &#8212; oh yes &#8212; I&#8217;m thankful for whiskey. I&#8217;m <em>very</em> thankful for Zoloft.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m thankful for plot bunnies and <a href=\"http://www.nanowrimo.org/\">Nanowrimo</a> and MyWANA/WANATribe and <a href=\"http://warriorwriters.wordpress.com/\">Kristen Lamb</a> and <a href=\"http://scififansat.blogspot.ca/\">Science Fiction Fantasy Saturday</a>. I&#8217;m thankful for coffee and pens and notebooks and Scrivener and <a href=\"http://www.seventhsanctum.com/\">Seventh Sanctum</a> and <a href=\"http://chaoticshiny.com/\">Chaotic Shiny</a>. <strong>I&#8217;m grateful for books.</strong></p>\n<p>Ok, maybe I did need to list what I&#8217;m grateful for &#8212; and it&#8217;s not even complete! Well, I&#8217;ll stop there.</p>\n<p><strong>I think Thanksgiving is an important holiday because it teaches us to remember gratefulness.</strong> To thank the world for what we have. It&#8217;s not about gift-giving, so it doesn&#8217;t get drowned in toxic consumerism. There <em>are</em> a lot of problems with how the Thanksgiving mythos is presented, especially to young kids, but there&#8217;s outreach being done to remedy that. We don&#8217;t need to do away with the holiday altogether. It&#8217;s not irredeemable. And it reminds us to practice gratefulness.</p>\n<p>We <em>should</em> practice gratefulness. It&#8217;s a good skill to have. And I think it&#8217;s something humans rapidly forget.</p>\n<p>So. <strong>What are you thankful for today?</strong></p>\n", "post_id": 2845, "location": false, "date": "10-07-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["life", "food and drink", "oh gods that's nasty", "bugs", "indian meal moths", "cleaning", "Home", "kitchen"], "text": "<p>I spent a good part of this weekend battling a bug infestation. <strong>It was, for lack of a better word, abso-frakking-lutely <em>disgusting.</em> </strong></p>\n<p>They&#8217;re apparently called Indian meal moths (I&#8217;m not sure if they&#8217;re from India or if <em>Indian</em> is supposed to be short for American Indian), and they come into your house via hippy food. Which I tend to eat a lot of. Apparently, so do they. They lay their eggs in grain-foods, and then disgusting larvae crawl out and nest in the corners of your house before eventually evolving to their final form, the fearless mini-moth.</p>\n<p>They are pernicious and voracious.</p>\n<p>I had to throw out most of my food. They were in the cupboards, the big pantry. Everywhere. <strong>I even found some in the <em>bathroom.</em></strong> That didn&#8217;t make sense until I realized they were also in the pantry, which is right next to the bathroom. (I think the pantry is <em>supposed</em> to be a linen closet, but I had more food than linens, so.)</p>\n<p>These bugs are the same bugs that infested my mom&#8217;s house a few weeks back. Actually, probably a lot longer than a few weeks back, but &#8216;a few weeks back&#8217; is when I cleaned out the infestation. Apparently they traveled from her place to mine, via the Box-of-Food Car on the Volvo Train.</p>\n<p>As soon as I realized what was going on, I looked into buying\u00a0 a flamethrower. <strong>Turns out flamethrowers are a lot harder to get than the movies would have you believe, so I searched out other options.</strong> Also, I don&#8217;t think mom would appreciate coming home from Nicaragua to find the apartment building had burned to the ground in a &#8220;mysterious blaze&#8221;.</p>\n<p><strong>It soon became apparent that my only option was to clean. By hand. Like a <em>Muggle.</em></strong></p>\n<p>And to find some way of killing the bugs that didn&#8217;t involve me actually touching them until they were good and dead. I was raised a Buddhist and I try to have respect for all living things, but there are limits to my compassion. Besides, it&#8217;s not like these guys are endangered. BELIEVE ME. There were a million+ in my apartment.</p>\n<p>I spent hours cleaning out cupboard and pantry. I went through every piece of food, saving what was bug-free and throwing out what was not. These bugs are so horrible that I couldn&#8217;t even risk keeping a lot of stuff that looked like it might have been infestation-free &#8212; I had to get rid of it.</p>\n<p><strong>I ended up throwing out some of my tea.</strong> That was <em>heartbreaking.</em></p>\n<p>Once the pantry was empty, I searched for a way to slaughter the bugs in <em><strong>glorious conquest!</strong></em> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_Reunion_%28Doctor_Who%29\">I wanted to make a million widows in one day</a>.</p>\n<p>But, you know, I&#8217;m not a rich person. So I searched within <del>myself</del> my house for what I might already have that could murder insects. I found an innocuous-looking clear liquid that smells quite strongly. <strong>Vinegar.</strong> Wonderful vinegar, amazing vinegar &#8212; will your gifts upon mortals know no limits? You kill plants. You burn retinas. You must be like acid to insect bodies.</p>\n<p>Vinegar in a spray bottle is possibly the greatest innovation to the lazy housekeeper. It cleans every<del>one</del>thing! Spray, wipe, done.</p>\n<p><strong>A mixture of vinegar and some water in a spray bottle will fix most cleaning woes in your house. Everything else can be solved with baking soda and Magic Erasers.</strong> Or fire. I never like ruling that one out completely.</p>\n<p>I got to work spraying the bugs with my vinegar-water mix. On Sunday I sprayed so much vinegar into the now-empty pantry that I could barely breathe. I sneezed more times that day than my mom does in a day, and that&#8217;s a pretty amazing feat. When the vinegar hit the bugs they writhed and fell from their headlong flight <del>out of hell</del>. The larvae didn&#8217;t fall off the walls, but they writhed just the same. I thought my work was done.</p>\n<p>On Monday I woke up early enough to get work done before I would have to start Thanksgiving dinner for Nate and myself. I had some coffee and sat down to work for several hours. At some point I decided to check and see if the bugs were still dead.</p>\n<p><strong>They weren&#8217;t.</strong></p>\n<p>Somehow they&#8217;d Lazarused their way back to the world of the living. I sprayed them again with vinegar, and this time they writhed and then shook it off like <em>godsdamn zombies</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>I now had zombie bugs in my apartment</strong>, and they were getting smarter.</p>\n<p>I went a little crazy. I kept the vinegar spray bottle on me at all times and sprayed the hells out of any bug that came anywhere near me. They started divebombing me; I&#8217;d drop and roll, firing off shots as I went down. It was all-out war.</p>\n<p>At some point Nate heard me scream <strong>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, come near me again and I&#8217;ll fucking rain down acid on your soulless husk of a body, demon bug!&#8221; </strong></p>\n<p>I was going crazy. I was at the end of my rope. I was ready to break into the armory and find a flamethrower and end it all in a blaze of glory.</p>\n<p>So Nate took me grocery shopping on our way to his place, and we got a can of Raid. Normally I don&#8217;t like using things like Raid; I don&#8217;t trust them. I tend to think they&#8217;ll probably give me cancer, and I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re very good for the environment. Not to mention my tendency to avoid killing other beings. <strong>I lived in Hawaii for 10 years without touching a can of Raid <em>once,</em> so that should tell you how desperate I was this weekend.</strong></p>\n<p>When I got home Monday evening, I got to work spraying chemical-y death upon the bugs. I sprayed every inch of the pantry and then shut the door to it, shoving a towel at the bottom so they couldn&#8217;t fly out through the crack between door and floor.</p>\n<p>I then coughed up a lung, because apparently it doesn&#8217;t matter if you wear something over your face &#8212; you use Raid, you&#8217;re breathing it in.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s Wednesday morning (officially; I haven&#8217;t slept yet, though, so it&#8217;s still Tuesday evening to me). The bugs in the pantry seem to still be dead. I saw one in the kitchen earlier today. It may have been two bugs, actually &#8212; it looked like it was two wrapped together in coitus, and they did leave a larva behind after I blasted their faces with a shot of Raid. Which&#8230;doesn&#8217;t make sense if they lay their eggs in grains.</p>\n<p>Ok, I have <em>no</em> idea how the life cycle of these things works except that if you kill them they come back to life.</p>\n<p>I gave the pantry another spray with Raid tonight, just to be on the safe side.</p>\n<p>Tomorrow, I finish cleaning. I shall fanatically wipe down every surface in the house that may have had a bug on it at some point in time. <del>I then will bathe in vinegar, scrubbing at my skin with a Brillo pad.</del> <strong>I&#8217;m thinking of installing an air lock at the front door that scans for bug infestation on anything brought into the apartment, and then blows it up.</strong></p>\n<p>Apparently this experience has awakened some latent obsessive behavior. That&#8217;s&#8230;probably not a good thing.</p>\n", "post_id": 2850, "location": false, "date": "10-10-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Smoke and Shadows", "family", "nanowrimo", "Literary+", "stories: Bellica", "workaholism", "blogging", "fiction", "writing life", "coffee", "poetry", "National Novel Writing Month", "writing", "Short story", "Kaimana Wolff"], "text": "<p>This is what I get for drinking three cups of coffee in the morning.

I did originally write about it in my post, but decided I wanted to focus on suicide and not misogyny in that post, and that I could write a follow-up post later.</p>\n<p>This is that follow-up post.</p>\n<p>Most of the posts about Amanda attribute her suicide to bullying and tend to ignore the fact that it was more than bullying. It was sexual harassment. It was assault based on slut-shaming.</p>\n<p>She was convinced to flash a guy on webcam. We don&#8217;t know if she was coerced or not, but it&#8217;s likely. Regardless, she regretted doing it.</p>\n<p>Then she was stalked and harassed by a guy who had gotten a hold of a screenshot of that flash, who told her to &#8220;give him a show&#8221; or he&#8217;d distribute the picture to all her friends.</p>\n<p><strong>That&#8217;s rape culture.</strong></p>\n<p>The idea that men are entitled to women&#8217;s bodies, and that if they don&#8217;t get what they want they can force the issue &#8212; that&#8217;s rape culture. The idea that stalking and harassing a girl because she flashed someone once online is acceptable &#8212; that&#8217;s rape culture. The idea that she got what she deserved because she slept with someone who was involved with another person &#8212; that&#8217;s rape culture. The framing of the story by <a href=\"http://m.torontosun.com/2012/10/11/vancouver-area-teen-kills-herself-after-posting-youtube-video-about-her-being-bullied\">certain news agencies</a> to moralize about how girls shouldn&#8217;t show their breasts on webcam because, oh, look what happens &#8212; that&#8217;s rape culture. <a href=\"http://www.vancouverobserver.com/blogs/feminista/why-isnt-anyone-talking-about-misogyny-involved-amanda-todds-life-and-death\">The fact that no one is really talking about the misogyny, sexism, and slut-shaming present in her case</a> &#8212; that&#8217;s rape culture. The comments on various sites by &#8220;trolls&#8221; &#8212; rape culture.</p>\n<p><strong>And social media has made rape culture more pervasive and more dangerous.<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>This bullying that Amanda received was based on fundamental beliefs that people hold about women, their sexuality, and whether or not they own their own bodies &#8212; and all those ideas come from rape culture.</p>\n<p>And the bullying, the harassment, of Amanda Todd is continuing even after her death. This story has become big, internationally, and the people who are bullying her <em>still</em> are not limited to people in British Columbia. I witnessed a few people come into one of the threads on the Facebook page dedicated to remembering her &#8212; <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/RIP-Amanda-Todd/472606062784532?sk=info\">RIP Amanda Todd</a> &#8212; and start to talk about how no one actually knew her like they did, and that she&#8217;d &#8220;asked for it&#8221;, that she&#8217;d &#8220;brought it upon herself&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Before I ask you if that wording sounds familiar at all, I&#8217;d like to point out that these people weren&#8217;t even Canadian. They were from various places in the States. They&#8217;d obviously never met Amanda Todd and didn&#8217;t know her or anyone in this town. Yet they felt compelled to lie in order to continue to harass a girl who&#8217;d committed suicide over the bullying she received.</p>\n<p>The phrases &#8220;she asked for it&#8221; and &#8220;she brought it upon herself&#8221; should sound familiar. We hear it every day when we hear news about a woman who&#8217;s been sexually assaulted. Raped. Molested. Abused. Murdered. Gone missing.</p>\n<p>Bullied to the point of committing suicide.</p>\n<p>And in the wake of this tragedy, BC and Canada are looking at ways of stopping bullying. Which is admirable, but fucking useless. Anti-bullying laws won&#8217;t stop the underlying problem: misogyny and rape culture. It&#8217;s putting a bandaid on a bullet wound.</p>\n<p>What needs to be addressed is the belief that a woman who shows her breasts is somehow less of a person because of it. What needs to be addressed is this feeling in young girls that they must be accepted, that they would do anything to be liked, even if it means being convinced to do things they&#8217;re less than comfortable with &#8212; things that can come back to haunt them. I didn&#8217;t know Amanda Todd, and I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s what happened to her &#8212; but <strong>I remember being around that age.</strong> I remember being coerced into having sex against my will when I was ten years old, because I was so desperate for my step-brother to stop treating me like shit. I remember not wanting it, but convincing myself that he&#8217;d like me better if I did it. I remember doing a host of other sexual activities that he asked for, because all I wanted was for my step-family to treat me like a human being instead of some sick animal that had crawled into their house to die that no one wanted to touch or feed or show any affection.</p>\n<p>I remember exactly what it was like to be 12 years old in a world that told me I was only worth anything as a sexual object.</p>\n<p>I remember feeling <em>wanted</em> when I agreed to do sexual things I wasn&#8217;t comfortable with. I remember being coerced into doing sexual acts online with people I didn&#8217;t know, and in meatspace with people I did know. <strong>I remember blaming myself for years, and never telling anyone until I was twenty.</strong></p>\n<p>If I&#8217;d had a webcam when I was 12, I probably would have flashed someone too. Not realizing that once something is on the internet, it&#8217;s out there forever. Not realizing it would be really unsafe for me to do that as an underage kid (I did a lot of things unsafely online when I was underage). Not realizing that <strong>the same society that wants me to be a sexual object because that&#8217;s the only way I&#8217;m worth something will also punish me for showing any sexuality.</strong></p>\n<p>This is rape culture. It&#8217;s a culture that demands ownership over women&#8217;s bodies and sexualities; it&#8217;s a culture that tells women that their only worth is as a sexual object; it&#8217;s a culture that punishes women for their sexuality. It&#8217;s what I grew up in, and it&#8217;s what Amanda Todd grew up in. And it&#8217;s what drove her to suicide.</p>\n<p>Not simple bullying. <strong>Bullying based in rape culture.</strong></p>\n<p>And no one is talking about it.

I&#8217;d never heard of him before then &#8212; apparently a lot of Canada hasn&#8217;t, even though he&#8217;s fairly well known in the States. For me, I think it&#8217;s just because I tend to know authors within a certain genre &#8212; speculative fiction &#8212; and I don&#8217;t really pay attention to what&#8217;s called &#8216;mainstream&#8217; fiction.</p>\n<p>But I fell in love with him during his talk.</p>\n<p>He talked about how science fiction and comic books are the genres he read, because things that were unrealistic were the only way to explain his life as a Dominican immigrant living in New Jersey. How the life of oppressed people is spoken to not through &#8216;mainstream&#8217; fiction, but through the fantastic, the strange, because when you live with society&#8217;s great boot on your neck life doesn&#8217;t add up according to the master narrative. His book <em>The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao</em> has a quote from <em>The Fantastic Four</em> on the epigraph page.</p>\n<p>He talked about white privilege and said &#8216;motherfucker&#8217; so many times I lost count. He talked about how he&#8217;s fascinated with how we privilege masculinity and the invisible power that goes with growing up a man, yet how that gets diluted if you&#8217;re not masculine <em>enough;</em> he talked about the history of colonialism and rape within the Caribbean &#8212; how do you form loving intimate relationships when your ancestral line was raped into existence? &#8212; and how the &#8220;exoticism&#8221; and &#8220;unbridled sexuality&#8221; of Caribbean and African-American women as viewed by mainstream society is directly linked to that. How do you admit centuries of rape and conquest without actually admitting it? Well, just say they&#8217;re <em>naturally</em> very sexual people. (See: the sexualizing of Native Women.)</p>\n<p>I was writing down some of the things he said because they were so true, I wanted to get as exact quotes as I could. (I&#8217;m not a fast writer, however, so some errors will occur.)</p>\n<p>On his political views and how they blend into his work:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Anyone who&#8217;s a reader knows no book is <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">not</span> a political act.</p></blockquote>\n<p>On the exclusivity of literature:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The biggest strength of any work is its stupendous particularity.</p></blockquote>\n<p>On the difference between religious works and literary ones:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The Bible and the Koran make universal claims that freeze people out. Literature, in its stupendous particularity, invites [&#8230;] people in.</p></blockquote>\n<p>He spoke about how, <strong>as writers, we must work <em>hard</em> at the parts we&#8217;re really shit at</strong> &#8212; which is why he wrote a story entirely in second-person viewpoint. He says it took him 11 years to write his first book and 16 to write his second, and that&#8217;s because writing is really difficult for him &#8212; and that there needs to be space for people for whom things that they&#8217;re good at take a long time. We have this idea that if someone is good at something, it should come quickly and easily to them &#8212; but that&#8217;s not always true.</p>\n<p>I got to meet him afterwards, when I went to get his book [that I&#8217;d picked up as soon as the reading was over] signed. He was incredibly sweet; he gave me a hug and a kiss on each cheek, and was totally unassuming. I told him I&#8217;d never heard of him before that night &#8212; &#8220;It&#8217;s ok, sweetie, no one has&#8221; &#8212; but that I loved him already &#8212; &#8220;Aw, thank you.&#8221; He thanked me personally for volunteering, and he&#8217;d said <em>thank you</em> to all the volunteers during his talk.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m now the very proud owner of a copy of <em>The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao</em>, signed to me.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m glad I got to see him speak, because he confirmed what I&#8217;d thought for a while: <strong>you can still be a successful writer and be political on your social media accounts, your blog, in public.</strong> We get told, as indie authors, to leave politics and religion out of it, that it has nothing to do with our books.</p>\n<p>My book is about political turmoil and revolution. It&#8217;s about warring goddesses and the mortal chess pieces they move across the board. It&#8217;s a feminist writing experiment with using female-centric language in a matriarchal society.\u00a0 How can religion and politics <em>not</em> have anything to do with my book? And if writing about politics on my blog or my Facebook or my Twitter turns people off from me as an author, then that&#8217;s their loss. I do not apologize.</p>\n<p>My politics are an intrinsic part of who I am, and you will find just as many posts about them here as you will find posts about what I ate for breakfast or my hilarious conversations with my boyfriend. You will find fewer posts about my religion, because I have <a href=\"http://innocenceandimmanence.wordpress.com/\">an entire blog for that elsewhere</a> &#8212; but I will never shy away from admitting that yes, I <em>am</em> a deeply religious person, and no, that&#8217;s not incompatible with paganism, nor is it incompatible with supporting science or rational thought or evolution or anything else that tends to get held up as mutually exclusive with religion. And my religion does deeply inform my writing, so no &#8212; I will not hide it. Not here.</p>\n<p>Junot Diaz reminded me that what&#8217;s important to me is never not relevant to my writing career. He re-sparked my desire to be political on this blog and my social media accounts. <strong>He helped me remember why I write in the first place: because a book can change the world, one person at a time.</strong></p>\n", "post_id": 3191, "location": false, "date": "10-21-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Writing"], "text": "<p>Continuing on <a title=\"SFFSat October 13th: Our heroines arrive in Southland\" href=\"http://katjevanloon.com/2012/10/12/sffsat-october-13th-our-heroines-arrive-in-southland/\">from where we left off last week</a> &#8212; Bellica Agate and her regiment have arrived in Southland, where an army of &#8220;gypsies&#8221; has taken over the town.

I managed to score a ticket for <a href=\"http://www.writersfest.bc.ca/2012festival/event/40-women-and-literature\">Women and Literature</a>, which was my first choice.</p>\n<p>I was super-stoked. This was definitely the one event I <em>really</em> wanted to see.</p>\n<p>The event was a panel of four women authors and a woman moderator/interviewer/timekeeper who would ask questions. The authors were Kate Mosse from the United Kingdom, Gail Jones from Australia, Gillian Jerome from British Columbia, and Susan Swan from Ontario. Here is the summary of the event:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In response to the 1991 Booker Prize nominee list, which included not one female author, novelist <strong>Kate Mosse</strong> founded the Orange Prize to celebrate outstanding fiction by women throughout the world. Now, more than 20 years later, poet <strong>Gillian Jerome</strong> has founded Canadian Women in the Literary Arts in response to the critical reception of women\u2019s creative writing. In this so-called post-feminist world, does the literary and critical environment reflect what\u2019s really happening? <strong>Susan Swan</strong>, novelist and past chair of the Writers\u2019 Union of Canada, has followed issues of gender equality in writing for decades. Australia\u2019s <strong>Gail Jones</strong>, an award-winning author and professor of writing, brings an international perspective to this panel discussion.</p></blockquote>\n<p>When the &#8220;post-feminist world&#8221; was mentioned, I and several other audience members guffawed. Jokes were made about Gillian Jerome&#8217;s binder, <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/10/17/mitt-romney-s-binders-full-of-women-comment-sets-internet-ablaze.html\">because it was full of women</a>.</p>\n<p>The discussion was good, and pretty much completely unsurprising to me. Women authors get reviewed less often than male authors do. It&#8217;s assumed that boys and men cannot relate to books written by women, but <em>can</em> relate to books written by men. It&#8217;s assumed that boys and men <em>must</em> have a male protagonist in order to enjoy the story &#8212; and boys and men are socialized to believe this from an early age. Women don&#8217;t get shortlisted as often, or win as often, many prominent literary prizes. Women are more generous readers than men &#8212; they&#8217;re more likely to read books with male protagonists with whom they can&#8217;t fully relate than men are to read books with female protagonists &#8212; I mean, obviously, women have <em>had</em> to be more generous readers with regards to that, because it&#8217;s not as if their stories have been centered in literature for centuries.</p>\n<p>And women and feminists <em>say</em> these things, say &#8220;This is what is going on, let&#8217;s talk about it,&#8221; and we get &#8220;Why are you so angry? Are you a lesbian? Do you hate men?&#8221; in response. Anytime more women authors become visible &#8212; anytime women become more visible in <em>any</em> field &#8212; it&#8217;s seen as a takeover. All male = neutral.</p>\n<p>And this discussion was refreshing, because it seemed we were actually able to talk about these things, for once, without derail.</p>\n<p>I was too happy, too soon.</p>\n<p>There was time for only three questions at the end. I finally worked up the courage to raise my hand for the last question &#8212; I wanted to know what their perspective was on genderqueer authors who had lived as women and still were assumed to be women finding spaces within women&#8217;s literature, within the circles of women authors supporting each other, etc &#8212; but the question went to a dude down at the end of my row instead.</p>\n<p>His question had nothing to do with the discussion. It had to do with <em>feminism in general</em>, and he prefaced it by saying &#8220;This is going to be a controversial question, and of course I believe in women&#8217;s equality.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Pro-tip: if you have to preface your &#8216;controversial&#8217; question with &#8216;of course I believe in _____&#8217;, it&#8217;s a pretty huge red flag that you actually don&#8217;t believe in ___. </strong>No matter how much you think you do.</p>\n<p>He took about three minutes to ask a long, convoluted, incredibly cissexist question. Bless Susan Swan, she managed to answer it in a way that placated him without actually agreeing fully with him. In my head I was screaming <em>GO HOME AND LEARN HOW TO USE GOOGLE ON THE INTERNET MACHINE; WE ARE NOT YOUR FUCKING EDUCATORS.</em></p>\n<p>Dudes &#8212; <strong>when you do this shit,</strong> when you come into a space where women are talking about specific focuses in feminism, and you ask your questions because <em>you&#8217;re just so damn confused</em>, <strong>you tell us that you don&#8217;t really give a shit about our concerns. You tell us that your question is more important than what we want to discuss, because you&#8217;re a man.</strong></p>\n<p>If you cannot come into a space that&#8217;s discussing above-101 level feminism and <em>hold your questions</em>, if you cannot learn to <em>listen</em> to people who have been <em>silenced</em> for centuries, then you have not grown up. Go back to elementary and learn some fucking manners.</p>\n<p>This incident was exemplary of the &#8220;BUT WHAT ABOUT TEH MENZ&#8221; trope. It&#8217;s ridiculous to think that feminists are not concerned with liberating men; of course we are. It&#8217;s ridiculous to think that we are not concerned with men&#8217;s issues. If you think that all feminists are man-haters, then you have no critical reading or thinking skills. Period. There is <em>more</em> than enough evidence out there &#8212; feminist blogs, feminist books &#8212; that proves that feminists are very much concerned with how patriarchy hurts men.</p>\n<p><strong>It&#8217;s just not how we frame our discussions.</strong></p>\n<p>Men&#8217;s voices have been centered for&#8230;well, pretty much the whole of Western history. We are socialized to believe that everything must continue to center male voices, male experiences in order to be <em>valid.</em> We continue to disbelieve things until we hear a white man say it. Then suddenly it&#8217;s revolutionary. (See: <a title=\"13 reasons this book made me homicidal: a review of Thirteen Reasons Why by Jay Asher\" href=\"http://katjevanloon.com/2012/01/19/13-reasons-this-book-made-me-homicidal-a-review-of-thirteen-reasons-why-by-jay-asher/\">Jay Asher&#8217;s piece of shit book</a>.) Because male voices continue to be centered in our society, because male voices continue to be seen as default, neutral, <em>truth.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Feminism seeks to center women&#8217;s voices.</strong> (And <a href=\"http://tigerbeatdown.com/2011/10/10/my-feminism-will-be-intersectional-or-it-will-be-bullshit/\">intersectional feminism</a> seeks to center female, <a href=\"http://slacktivist.typepad.com/slacktivist/2012/02/quiltbag.html?cid=6a00d8341c582a53ef0167632e1bdd970b\">QUILTBAG</a>, disabled, neuroatypical, and POC voices. Intersectionality = understanding where different privileges and oppressions intersect.)\u00a0 While it also seeks equality for <em>all</em> people, it does not behoove us to do this through the centering of male voices. Because <strong>male voices have been centered for centuries.</strong> It&#8217;s time for a new perspective. It&#8217;s time to work from margin to center &#8212; not from center to margin.</p>\n<p>Real change occurs on the margins of things. Not in the mainstream. You think you can change the system from within &#8212; that if you just learn its ropes and follow its rules for a certain amount of time, then you can make it change. It ends up changing you.</p>\n<p>So, fellas, next time you&#8217;re at an event or in a space where women are talking about feminism, oppression, privilege, kyriarchy, and all that jazz, and you have a 101-level question about feminism in general that could easily be researched at home?</p>\n<p><em><strong>Shut. the fuck. up.</strong></em></p>\n<p>Ps. I did get to speak to Kate Mosse after, when I got her book <em>Citadel</em> signed, and I asked her my question in short-form. She said that yes, she did feel there was room for genderqueer authors in women&#8217;s literature, which honestly made me feel better about being in women author&#8217;s spaces. She also said that she thought my novel sounded really interesting and she might check it out, which made me squee with happiness.</p>\n", "post_id": 3208, "location": false, "date": "10-23-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["VIWF", "Writing", "stories: The Jade Star of Athering", "con crud", "VIWF2012"], "text": "<p>Last week <a title=\"Day one of VIWF!\" href=\"http://katjevanloon.com/2012/10/16/day-one-of-viwf/\">I volunteered sixteen hours</a> at the Writers Fest.

The raffle was to win a painting by Andre Petterson. I&#8217;m not going to lie, it was a bit of a hard sell. I think the painting didn&#8217;t really appeal to a lot of people, and I think the people it did appeal do didn&#8217;t have any place to put it. Still, during my first shift we sold 11 tickets &#8212; that was at the Opening Reception &#8212; and according to the volunteer manager I had the best sales all week.

I used to live there, ages ago, and it hasn&#8217;t changed much since then. It&#8217;s artsy and hippy and absolute hell to drive or park in. There are at least three independent coffee shops. There&#8217;s a Public Market. And there&#8217;s Arts Umbrella, which is where I spent a lot of time as a kid, taking classes in architecture, animation, pottery, jewelry-making, film, and other arts. While I was walking past Arts Umbrella on my way to Festival House on my first day, I noticed some chalk graffiti on the wall of the building. It was <em>Doctor Who</em> graffiti. I had a <em>squee</em> moment, and took a picture. The graffiti stayed up the whole week, so I got to show the real thing to my mom, too. (Then I convinced her to watch 6 episodes and finish off season 5 before she went up to Powell River this week.)</p>\n<p>My second shift volunteering was during <a title=\"A Brief Wondrous Talk from Junot Diaz\" href=\"http://katjevanloon.com/2012/10/21/the-brief-wondrous-talk-from-junot-diaz/\">Junot Diaz&#8217;s talk</a>, which I have no pictures of, unfortunately. My phone was very low on battery for some reason. I then had two days off, during which I went to <a title=\"There\u2019s one in every group\" href=\"http://katjevanloon.com/2012/10/22/theres-one-in-every-group/\">Women and Literature</a> on Thursday (Friday was spent at Abra-cadaver, the Screaming Chickens Halloween Burlesque show). Saturday I worked a double shift: 4 to 7pm followed by 7pm to 10:30pm. This was for <em>What If?</em> with Margaret Atwood, Cory Doctorow, and Pasha Malla, and <em>A Tribute to Patrick Lane</em>, respectively.</p>\n<p>I have to admit, I was a little disappointed with Atwood. I read <em>The Handmaid&#8217;s Tale</em> in high school and I&#8217;ve been a fan of hers ever since, but she came off as&#8230;very pretentious and a bit ageist and sexist, which is unfortunate. There were several times I had to resist the urge to stand up and yell &#8220;Um, actually you&#8217;re <em>wrong,&#8221;</em> at her. She was very dismissive of a lot of things that make up the current culture for the younger generation, such as, oh, the internet and video games, and refused to hear that the internet may be the gateway for a lot of discretionary activities for people nowadays, which was the point Doctorow was making. She asked people in the audience to raise their hands if they&#8217;d heard about the Writers Fest on the internet, as if that was the defining point, and very few people raised her hands. She then looked at Doctorow and made some comment about her point being made.</p>\n<p>I hesitate to point out that the majority of that event, and almost every event at VIWF save the ones in the mornings that are advertised as <em>for schools</em>, are full of middle-aged people. There are very few teenagers outside the school events, and a handful of 20-somethings or 30-somethings. These are also the middle-aged folks who have extra money lying around &#8212; otherwise they wouldn&#8217;t be at the VIWF &#8212; and therefore don&#8217;t need the internet as a source for discretionary activities. If you can afford to go out to the movies, or to the physical bookstore, you go. When you can&#8217;t afford those things, the internet becomes a source of cheap entertainment &#8212; I can either pay 8 dollars a month for Netflix and watch as many movies or TV shows as they have, or I can go out to see <em>one</em> movie in theatres for 25 dollars and up for one night. I can go to the bookstore once a week and spend 25 &#8212; 125 dollars on, say, 5 books, or I can peruse the works of indie authors and pick up 25 ebooks for 25&#8211;75 bucks. And there are tons of free books out there too. Blogs are free, many webseries are free. When you&#8217;re as poor as I am &#8212; as a lot of people my age are, because there&#8217;s nothing out there for us jobwise unless we have at least an MA &#8212; then the internet becomes a much friendlier source of discretionary activities.</p>\n<p>So, no, that wasn&#8217;t a fair question to ask considering the demographics of the audience. Not to mention, <em>you&#8217;re at a fest for people who love books</em>. That&#8217;s why they&#8217;re there. So the question of authors having to compete with the rest of the internet for the attention of many readers doesn&#8217;t really apply to a lot of folks at VIWF, because they&#8217;re going to read <em>anyway.</em> They&#8217;re the smallest percentage of a writer&#8217;s audience &#8212; the avid reader. The avid reader picks up books and reads them. You don&#8217;t have to worry about them finding you, because eventually they will. It&#8217;s the non-avid readers you have to convince; it&#8217;s the attention of the non-avid readers for which you&#8217;ll be competing with the rest of the internet and its activities.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_3220\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://katjevanloon.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/viwf2.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-3220 \" title=\"viwf2\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/katjevanloon.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/viwf2-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Me and Cory Doctorow.</p></div>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Anyway, I don&#8217;t mean to rant about Atwood too much.

I got to meet Cory Doctorow when I got his book signed, and he&#8217;s super cool. I told him I tweeted him a few minutes beforehand, and within about 20 minutes after the signing he&#8217;d tweeted me back. I now have <em>Little Brother</em>, and will start reading it as soon as I finish a few other books on my currently reading list.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_3221\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://katjevanloon.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/viwf3.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-3221\" title=\"viwf3\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/katjevanloon.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/viwf3-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Between events, mom and I decided to try and get some pictures of ourselves. Most of them didn&#8217;t turn out so well, but this one I found particularly amusing. I&#8217;m obviously saying &#8220;Get out of my light or you&#8217;ll never work in this town again.&#8221; Or something.</p></div>\n<p>The <em>Tribute to Patrick Lane</em> was an event of [mostly] poetry, so I spent most of my time knitting. I like some poems and some poets &#8212; I don&#8217;t particularly enjoy poetry in general. I did enjoy Lorna Crozier&#8217;s erotic poem; it was quite amusing. There were many speakers, including Gillian Jerome, Susan Musgrave, and Margaret Atwood. My mom got to see this event, which she was very pleased about because a) she loves poetry and b) if she&#8217;d followed her heart back in the 60s, this is the crew she would have been hanging out with. The Canadian poets crew. I remember thinking with each speaker as they spoke about various poets <em>My mom knows that person. My mom should be on that stage.</em></p>\n<p>We were done closer to 11pm than 10:30pm, and then mom and I took off for home to get as much sleep as we could before waking up at 6am. Her next shift was driving Patrick Lane to Tsawwassen at 7:30am, and I&#8217;d taken an extra shift of selling raffle tickets for the Sunday Brunch. My shift wasn&#8217;t until 10am, but mom wouldn&#8217;t have been able to make it back to Coquitlam to pick me up and bring me out again in time, so I had to come in at 6:30.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_3222\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"http://katjevanloon.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/viwf4.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-3222\" title=\"viwf4\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/katjevanloon.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/viwf4-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The everburning flame outside the Granville Island Hotel.

It&#8217;s quite perfect.</p></div>\n<p>Before I headed down from the hotel towards the nearest coffee shop (which turned out to be closed), I got to meet Patrick Lane. He asked if I was coming along with mom and him in the car, to which I said no, I was going to write in a coffee shop. (Mom ended up giving him a copy of my poetry book <em>glasstown,</em> which was pretty exciting to hear.) Of course, it was raining, so I slogged through puddles to find Agro caf\u00e9. Turned out they weren&#8217;t open until 9am on Sundays, to which I may have uttered a string of expletives. So I continued on towards the Public Market, which also looked closed, but wasn&#8217;t. Google Local assured me that JJ Bean was open at 7am.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_3223\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://katjevanloon.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/viwf5.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-3223\" title=\"viwf5\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/katjevanloon.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/viwf5-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ghost town. But a very pretty one.</p></div>\n<p>Granville Island is a ghost town early Sunday morning. I felt I was walking through a post-zombie-apocalypse city. When I ran into other people I was close to yelling &#8220;Zombies!&#8221; and running away. I didn&#8217;t, but as soon as they saw me they turned in the other direction. Perhaps they thought I was a zombie. I certainly resemble one that early in the morning.</p>\n<p>Finally I made it to the Market and dried off inside. I got a chai latte from JJ Bean (which was delicious &#8212; if you haven&#8217;t tried JJ Bean beverages yet, you should) and, after chatting up the folks who were there about the Writers Fest, I went and found a place to sit down and take off my shoes and socks to let my feet dry out a little bit.</p>\n<p>This is where I discovered my Writers Fest tote bag, given to all the volunteers, was not waterproof. Or even resistant. I&#8217;d decided to carry my laptop in it.</p>\n<p>Yay.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_3226\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"http://katjevanloon.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/viwf8.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-3226\" title=\"viwf8\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/katjevanloon.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/viwf8-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">&#8220;Oh dear gods, why don&#8217;t you have booze in you?&#8221;</p></div>\n<p>I took all the things out of the bag and wiped them down, trying to get them as dry as possible. The bag got turned upside down on the floor, letting the remaining water drip out from the inside. I then sat back and tried to enjoy my chai latte and not panic over the fact that my laptop and my notebook for <em>The Jade Star of Athering</em> were both wet. The laptop was off, so so long as I waited until it was completely dry before turning it on again it should be fine. The notebook was only wet on the edges; I don&#8217;t think any ink smeared.</p>\n<p>After finishing my drink, I went to Terra Breads to take advantage of my 5 dollar off discount card (part of the VIWF volunteer&#8217;s package). I also asked them for an extra plastic bag, into which I put my laptop and notebooks before putting them back in the totebag.</p>\n<p>Voila &#8212; waterproofing achieved.</p>\n<p>When I went outside, it was no longer raining.

At 10:15, my partner for Raffle Ticket sales was still not there, so mom and I took the bag of stuff down to Performance Works and got set up.</p>\n<p>For some reason, though, they&#8217;d moved our table from directly under the painting we were trying to sell to what we were told was the author signing table. Which meant that during the last speaker we&#8217;d have to pack up and leave the table. We did so as quietly as we could, but still got shushed by someone in charge. It then turned out that the authors didn&#8217;t use the table we were at at all, but used the one right next to it. So&#8230;we could have stayed there.</p>\n<p>It was the first year they did raffle tickets, so there were some miscommunications. It&#8217;s understandable; next year will go much more smoothly.</p>\n<p>At any rate, it may have been for the best. I walked through the crowd selling tickets, and we sold about 15 during that shift &#8212; personal best. It was just frustrating, especially when I&#8217;d had so little sleep and not enough caffeine.</p>\n<p>Overall I had a good time at the Writers Fest. I made some new friends, I met some authors, and I got to hang out on Granville Island for several days. Can&#8217;t beat that.</p>\n<p>(Even if I do now have a case of con crud.)</p>\n", "post_id": 3216, "location": false, "date": "10-25-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["politics", "g8/g20", "robin hood tax", "news"], "text": "<p>So, here in Canada we&#8217;re lobbying for something called The Robin Hood Tax to be put into place<sup>1</sup>. The basic idea of the tax is this: every day banks and financial institutions have tons of transactions, right? Well, what if we put a small tax &#8212; only .05% &#8212; on each transaction, payable by the institution? Economists estimate that this will earn around 650 billion dollars<em> per year</em> that can be then put towards things like ending poverty and climate change (both here and abroad), making sure banks pay their fair share of the economic recovery, and help to curb the recession.</p>\n<p>Banks are obscenely wealthy, and they make that wealth by charging people like you and me. The Robin Hood Tax forces them to give something back, so that people can get some food in their bellies and a roof over their homes &#8212; in environmentally friendly ways. Awesome deal, right?</p>\n<p>Well. The current Canadian government doesn&#8217;t seem to think so, which, honestly, isn&#8217;t surprising. They are <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/g8-g20/economy/tories-launch-global-fight-against-bank-tax/article1572287/\">adamantly against</a> implementing this global bank tax, because, well, they&#8217;re a bunch of rich folks.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s get real here, people. When your elected officials come from rich backgrounds, you get a system that continually reinforces the idea that poor people are criminal, and that rich people are the ones who must be protected at all costs. It&#8217;s called privilege, and our EOs have it in spades (most of them white, cisgendered, heterosexual, rich men). Stephen Harper and his cronies have no <em>idea</em> what it&#8217;s like to be your everyday Canadian, trying to pull in a living though the system is stacked against you because you weren&#8217;t rich to begin with (how dare you).</p>\n<p>It is because they have no idea what it&#8217;s like that I take it upon myself, as an active, informed, citizen, to try and let them know how important this tax would be to Canadians &#8212; not only to help us out, but to help us not be embarrassed on the global stage <em>yet again</em>.</p>\n<p>So. I sent an email to our Prime Minister Harper and our Finance Minister Flaherty. This is what I said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I am writing to urge you to support a tiny fee that can make a world of difference.</p>\n<p>Economists estimate that a 0.05 per cent tax on speculative banking transactions \u2013 such as bonds, derivatives, currencies and hedge fund trading \u2013 could raise more than $650 billion each year. To protect consumers, this tax would be limited to transactions between banks and other financial institutions.</p>\n<p>This money could be used to support much needed public services and to fight poverty at home and around the world. It is important Canada honour its commitment to the Millennium Development Goals, commitments made at previous G8 and G20 summits and help countries adapt to climate change.</p>\n<p>British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy have all stated their support for the Financial Transaction Tax, as have many renowned economists and financial experts.</p>\n<p>As the co-chair of the upcoming G20 Summit, Canada can help to ensure world leaders take steps towards adoption of the Financial Transaction Tax.</p>\n<p>I have copied my Member of Parliament on this email. As a constituent, I urge them also to support this policy.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I have no idea if it was read by the ones who were supposed to get it or not. And for the record, this is the suggested email at the Robin Hood Tax site that they let you send out; I sent it because, well, it said all I wanted to say.</p>\n<p>I received a response from John Weston, MP for West Vancouver &#8212; Sunshine Coast &#8212; Sea to Sky Country. He&#8217;s a successful West Vancouver lawyer &#8212; that says it all.<sup>2</sup></p>\n<blockquote><p>Thank you for your letter regarding the proposal for a financial transactions tax. Our country in no way contributed to the Global Recession, and throughout the crisis, our banks have maintained healthy leverage ratios and largely avoided exposure to toxic assets.</p>\n<p>No major Canadian financial institutions failed and none required bailouts from our Government, unlike the situation that was present in the US and several European countries. The strong performance of our banking sector showcased the effectiveness of Canada\u2019s regulatory approach. As we host and chair the G-20 this year, we will encourage the adoption of similar regulatory processes globally.</p>\n<p>The strong performance of our banking sector showcased the effectiveness of Canada\u2019s regulatory approach. Our government is committed to reducing taxes, not to imposing a global tax on daily financial services. Modest and responsible regulation is the answer, not additional taxation.</p>\n<p>Thank you for taking the time to write.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Ugh. This just pisses me off royally, especially as the BC Liberals are trying to get the HST implemented (that will hopefully fall apart; we&#8217;ve got people all over the province signing the petition against it) &#8212; so, taxation is fine if it&#8217;s against the citizenry, but not against banks who are so bloated and rich off our hardworking money they are inert, sitting in their greed like fat ticks feeding off the populace?</p>\n<p>I wrote him back, a bit politer.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Dear Mr. Weston,</p>\n<p>I urge you to step outside West Vancouver from time to time and see how the rest of your constituents live &#8212; the ones who aren&#8217;t already rich, who have to live on a minimum wage that is so low it should be criminal, who get no funding because they dare to live unconventional lifestyles, or work in the arts.</p>\n<p>Not to mention students who are starving because there are no jobs, and even less funding.</p>\n<p>Even though Canada may not have contributed directly to the recession, we as a country have made ourselves so dependent on the US economy that their recession hits us just as hard. Not only that, as our major trading partner sinks further into recession, it&#8217;s going to get worse.</p>\n<p>Canada is not an island. You think things may be fine now, but we are part of the global community. What happens in other countries affects us too.</p>\n<p>Banks make obscene profits while your people are suffering. What is the downside in taxing the rich to give to the poor?</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s called the Robin Hood Tax for that very reason. You know that old story, of course &#8212; everyone does. Who would you like to be remembered as? The people&#8217;s hero, or the Sheriff of Nottingham?</p></blockquote>\n<p>Today was declared a national day of action for the tax:\u00a0<a href=\"http://robinhoodtax.ca/24hours\"> 24 hours for the tax.</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://katjevanloon.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/2010-05-19-24hours_small.jpeg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-323\" title=\"24 hours for the tax\" src=\"https://katjevanloon.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/2010-05-19-24hours_small.jpeg?w=300&#038;h=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<p>I have done as much as possible today to let the world know how important it is that the RHT gets pushed through &#8212; I even called the office of the prime minister.<sup>3</sup></p>\n<blockquote><p>Hello, Mr. Prime Minister. I&#8217;m calling to urge you to reconsider your stance on the Robin Hood Tax and to work towards implementing it. Though Canada has not contributed directly to the recession plaguing the states, we still have made ourselves so dependent on our neighbor country that their economic crises hit us just as hard. Now more than ever Canada needs to be a leader and a friend to our allies, and you need to be a hero to your people. The Robin Hood Tax will make that difference, especially for those in this country who lack the financial means to feed or clothe themselves. How do you want to be remembered? As Robin Hood, or the Sheriff of Nottingham?</p></blockquote>\n<p>Some repeats of my letter to Mr. Weston, but I think they&#8217;re sentiments that bear repeating.</p>\n<p>Anyway, this is only the beginning. It&#8217;s so important that Canadian citizens take a stand &#8212; while we do nothing, our government works to embarrass us in front of the rest of the world time and time again. There&#8217;s this false idea here that Canadian politics aren&#8217;t that interesting, or important &#8212; who cares? We&#8217;ve got free health care!</p>\n<p>Well, free health care isn&#8217;t enough. We also need a health care system that works (did you know birth control isn&#8217;t covered? Neither is dental. And if you&#8217;re lucky enough to have a doctor, your appointments are super-short, because there&#8217;s so much demand and not enough supply), and a system put into place to end poverty before it begins. People in Canada are starving. They have to choose between electricity or rent, or rent or food. Just like people in the United States have to choose between meds or food.</p>\n<p>I for one am tired of being poor and being unable to fix it (no jobs + no funding for the arts + student loans + career choices all underfunded and suffering budget cuts = I will die before I&#8217;m 30). This tax? Will fix things &#8212; not only for me, but for people who are worse off than I am.</p>\n<p>Take a stand.

I was heading to my friend&#8217;s house in Burnaby for a Friday night write-in. It was raining, which is the usual in Vancouver from about the end of September to the end of June. It was night time as well<del>, which is usual after the sun sets.</del> I had my wipers going so I could see and <em>not crash and die in a fiery ball of fiery death</em>.</p>\n<p>Then there was a <em>clunk!</em> and a <em>scraaaaaaaappppppeeeeeee</em>, and suddenly I couldn&#8217;t see out the driver&#8217;s side window. The wiper blade had come loose and flipped itself so it was now pointing outwards, and the metal bit that holds the blade on (I have no idea what these things are called, ok, I just drive the car and check my oil once a week) was scraping the windshield glass.</p>\n<p>I pulled over and turned on my emergency flashers and stood in the pouring rain trying to fix the godsforsaken thing for about twenty minutes, perhaps half an hour. I&#8217;m not sure, because when my limbs freeze I lose track of time. It soon became apparent that I would not be able to reattach the wiper blade in the dark and driving rain, <em>because what the fuck do I know about wiper blades,</em> so I did the next best thing.</p>\n<p>I drove with my window down and wiped the rain away by hand. The wiper blade was separate from the arm-thingy, so I just had to hold it by the corner, lean forward, and wipe away the rain when it got too thick.</p>\n<p>The only problem with this is I have to use my left hand to wipe the windshield, and that&#8217;s my writing hand. So by the time I reached my friend&#8217;s place for the write-in, my hand was numb and cramped and wanted to fall off. I&#8230;didn&#8217;t get much writing done. Also her cat distracted me. <em>It&#8217;s a valid excuse.</em></p>\n<p>After the write-in I managed to fit the blade back onto the arm, and started the drive home. It was still raining, so I turned on the wipers. And the godsdamned thing flipped <em>again,\u00a0</em>after about five minutes of driving.</p>\n<p>I spent the entire drive from Burnaby to Coquitlam wiping by hand. I was exhausted and had frostbite on my hand by the time I got home. Ok, maybe I&#8217;m exaggerating, <em>I was cold ok.</em></p>\n<p>Once I reached home, I was able to fix the wiper blade <em>again.</em> I have a brightly-lit underground parkade in which to park my car, therefore there was light! And I could see what I had been doing horribly, horribly wrong before!</p>\n<p>I fixed it and went to bed.</p>\n<p>Saturday I decided to go to my boyfriend&#8217;s house. He lives in Delta. It was misting outside, but nothing as serious as rain. When I got about ten klicks from home &#8212; ie, past the point of no return &#8212; the rain started, so I turned on my wipers.</p>\n<p>Oh, wait, make that <em>wiper.</em> Now that the driver&#8217;s side blade was fixed, the arm refused to work. I spent the entire drive looking out the passenger side of the windshield. Or out the window. That was fun. I love driving slowly and getting my face all chapped.</p>\n<p>I am now stranded, more or less. Ogre&#8217;s going to take a look at the wipers and see if he can fix them, but if he can&#8217;t I have to go home before sunset so it&#8217;s a bit safer, and then I will be stuck at home until&#8230;I don&#8217;t know.

I&#8217;ve already hit 25K in my NaNoWriMo project, <em>Stranger Skies</em>.</p>\n<p>The story is fleshing itself out nicely, and I&#8217;ve gone ahead and done the Smashwords NaNoWriMo promotion &#8212; <a href=\"http://www.smashwords.com/books/view/252291\">you can read chapters 1 and 2 for free</a>. Curious as to what it&#8217;s about? Here&#8217;s a short description:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Silva, Lady of the True Woods, Goddess of the Deep Furs, falls through a portal during her search for her missing friend, Etan. She lands on the planet below, suddenly mortal.</p>\n<p>On an alien planet, she must navigate her new and strange mortal life. Soon she discovers there&#8217;s a reason for everything, and her coming to this new world was not by accident.</p>\n<p>As war brews on the horizon, Silva goes on a journey to reclaim her godhood, find Etan, and save the wolves of Min.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>I&#8217;m experimenting with several different things for this story.</strong> I&#8217;ve named chapters with things like <em>Falling to the Future, Flesh Prison, </em>or<em> The Wolf in the Woods</em> &#8212; instead of my usual practice of naming chapters with the name of the character who&#8217;s telling that particular part. (I say &#8216;usual practice&#8217;, but truth is I&#8217;ve only done that for one book &#8212; <em>Bellica. The Jade Star of Athering</em> is, so far, simply divided up by numbered chapters. So is <em>Islands of Fire and Water</em>. That may change.) Another, I&#8217;m not writing about Terrans, or Terra, or Terran colonies at all. The main character is original from Terra, yes, but she&#8217;s also originally a goddess &#8212; it&#8217;s not exactly the same as, say, writing about a Terran mortal traveling to a new planet. So that&#8217;s interesting.</p>\n<p>The big experiment is that I actually planned out the story. Not every scene was decided ahead of time (and a lot in the latest chapters have changed), but the big ones were. I decided, ahead of time, what my First Plot Point was, my Second Plot Point, my pinch points, my resolution. I have <a href=\"http://storyfix.com/\">Larry Brooks</a> to thank for that &#8212; while I don&#8217;t agree with him <em>wholly</em> on his philosophy that planning is superior to pantsing or percolating, <strong>I do concede that planning my Nano novel is leading to an infinitely better first draft, and a higher likelihood of my hitting 50K well before the month is over.</strong> And I wouldn&#8217;t have been able to plan if I hadn&#8217;t read the majority of his posts on how to plan your Nano novel.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a pantser or percolator and you want to give planning a try, I recommend reading Larry&#8217;s posts for some ideas as to where to start.</p>\n<p>Now, full disclosure, while planning has yielded higher word counts and better writing for me, I don&#8217;t fully like it. It&#8217;s contrary to my nature, so I may never fully like it. But I find that when I do a beat sheet and figure out the big five scenes ahead of time, I get sort of bored with the story early on. I wasn&#8217;t able to do a complete beat sheet, and I found myself wanting to skip ahead to where I&#8217;d quit planning out scenes &#8212; I wanted to &#8220;get to the good stuff&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Which tells me something important about myself. As much as I dislike having my routine changed unexpectedly, I love the unknown when it comes to writing. I like getting stuck and having to think about it for a few weeks until it suddenly hits me, a flash of inspiration while I sit in the bath, getting pruney. <strong>Running naked down the street shouting <em>EUREKA!</em> appeals to me.</strong></p>\n<p>I also find that I&#8217;m not always sure what will take a full scene, or more than one. Some things that I had planned out as one scene took three; other things that were planned as four scenes only took two. I&#8217;m having to adjust as I get through these bits, re-numbering scenes and re-structuring chapters.</p>\n<p>Which is fine. It&#8217;s a learning experience. I&#8217;m not knocking it. It works.</p>\n<p>But I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll be planning all my stories. The NaNo ones, yes. Possibly short stories, as well. The other novels?</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m going to keep on percolating, I think.</p>\n<p>This, of course, means that <em>The Jade Star of Athering</em> will probably not be done until the end of December, and released at some point in early 2013. I&#8217;m aiming for April. Cross your fingers that that will happen (and let me know if you&#8217;re interested in being a beta reader).</p>\n<p><strong>What about you?

When she beats the living hell out of a guy who not only assaults <em>her,</em> but Amaruq too.</p>\n<p><strong>Pure unfiltered badassery runs in my veins, in case you were wondering.</strong></p>\n<p>Anyway, if you like dog stories &#8212; go check out <em>How to Keep a Human</em>. Mom&#8217;s busy writing the next book in Amaruq&#8217;s series of stories (<em>Must Love Humans</em>), and you can <a href=\"http://loboslocos.net/category/book-excerpts/\">see an excerpt from it over at Lobos Locos</a>, where Amaruq and the rest of the furry Pack members blog about all sorts of things.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">~*~</p>\n<p>I think that&#8217;s it for this post. See you tomorrow, when I swear copiously while ranting. (Because that&#8217;s new.)</p>\n", "post_id": 3277, "location": false, "date": "11-16-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Diane Whiteside", "Lucy Monroe", "paranormal romance", "Susan Kearney", "Rebecca York", "feminism"], "text": "<p>Recently I was given a copy of <em>Unleashed</em> &#8212; a set of 4 short stories all in the genre of Paranormal Romance.</p>\n<p><em>Awesome</em>, I think. <em>I need a good escape.</em></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, two out of four of the stories made me want to escape <em>back into real life</em> because the men I know are better than the ones portrayed within the stories. That&#8217;s pretty damn sad, considering I&#8217;ve classified my last two relationships as wars because of the PTSD they&#8217;ve given me (Vietnam and Desert Storm, in order, in case you&#8217;re interested).</p>\n<p>I mean, there&#8217;s a reason we read romance &#8212; <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">we </span><em><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">want</span></em><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> to believe</span> in people loving each other. I am the Mulder of paranormal romance &#8212; but my Scully side wants a little more from romance stories than &#8220;instant soul-mate, just add tears&#8221;.</p>\n<p>But. Not knowing any of this before I started, I dove in eagerly into the first story, <strong>&#8220;Bond of Silver&#8221; by Rebecca York.</strong></p>\n<p>This story follows Alexander on a quest to find his soul mate &#8212; it takes a while to figure out what the crap is going on, but eventually the readers discover he is from a land called New Atlantis, which was founded by the refugees from &#8212; you guessed it &#8212; Atlantis, many centuries ago. It is located in the Caribbean and hidden from the modern world by magical powers possessed by the people who reside there. But, they need new blood to keep the shield strong &#8212; so they go to the Temple of Dreams where they go into a hallucinogenic stupor to dream of their soul mates. Their soul mates are out in our world and have the kinds of powers needed to keep the shield strong, and when people of New Atlantis dream of their true loves, a bond is formed and&#8230;.</p>\n<p>Ok, I have to stop. I was about to vomit.</p>\n<p>Anyway, despite the whole &#8220;OMG SOUL MATES LOL&#8221; thing that just instantly turns me off in any romance, I had high hopes, and continued in my quest to finish this story. I read the whole thing.</p>\n<p>YOU WIN, REBECCA YORK. I AM OFFICIALLY BORED TO DEATH.</p>\n<p>There is nothing more to the story: Alexander dreams of Claire, but THE WITCH comes in and is like OH NOES YOU&#8217;LL TAKE MY DAUGHTER FROM ME (blatant rip-off of Rapunzel, btw). Claire lives in California, and is an artist like he is. Her powers are also similar to his. But not as strong, natch, she&#8217;s a female, we&#8217;re all weak lol. After she &#8220;saves his life&#8221; because he stupidly fell off a cliff, they fuck and he goes to stay at her mom&#8217;s bed and breakfast. Also, he&#8217;s lying about who he is and fakes a rock-climbing injury (tendon, in ankle, walks with a limp) in order to insinuate himself into her life TOTALLY NOT THE BEHAVIOR OF A SOCIOPATH AMIRITE? Mom has problems with them being together cause she knows that he&#8217;s from New Atlantis cause &#8212; ding ding ding &#8212; she was a soul mate of Alexander&#8217;s foster-father and he got her knocked up and then left her to raise a daughter with telekinetic powers alone (I am imagining a high school prom and lots of pigs&#8217; blood, don&#8217;t know about you). This brings up the whole GASP YOU WERE LYING TO ME I&#8217;M GOING TO RUN AWAY INTO THE HILLS WHERE IT&#8217;S BEEN STORMING ALL DAY AND GET BURIED IN A MUDSLIDE KTHXBAI. Alex then saves silly female&#8217;s life and she realizes how he really must be her Twue Love(TM), and decides to go back with him. Foster father shows up and manipulates mother to come back too and EVERYTHING IS PERFECT FOREVER, YAY.</p>\n<p>No, Claire, your career isn&#8217;t important! Pack up and move to this random dude&#8217;s magical home where recreational drug use is second only to lessons in kidnapping because your vagina is lonely! Good idea!</p>\n<p>Also, whoops, SPOILER ALERT LOL. (I&#8217;m such a douche.)</p>\n<p><strong>2 stars</strong>. That&#8217;s being generous, and it only gets that because of the last story, which tipped the scales.</p>\n<p>But that&#8217;s for last. Next is <strong>&#8220;Red Skies at Night&#8221;, by Diane Whiteside</strong>. This story is in the Texas Vampires series, and it acted as a salve to my wounded eyes after Bond of Silver. A blend of paranormal romance and hard-hitting detective thriller, there are also touches of western in this well-crafted story.</p>\n<p>Whiteside&#8217;s characters, Gillian and Travis, are intelligent and well-developed. There is as much conflict between them as there is raw sexual energy, and their relationship develops honestly. There is no flowery talk of soul-mates. No &#8220;I&#8217;ve been a virgin till now!&#8221; This is a story about two experienced adults who know what they like and are courageous enough to go for it, even when flung into a situation that could cost both their lives. Well told, the story is riveting &#8212; I was on the edge of my seat until the end &#8212; and ties up all loose ends. There is nothing to leave the reader wondering &#8220;Wait, what about&#8230;?&#8221;</p>\n<p>This story sold me on Whiteside&#8217;s writing, and I&#8217;ll be searching for more of her work at my local library and bookstores.</p>\n<p><strong>5 stars</strong>, no spoilers. You&#8217;ll have to read it and see for yourself why it&#8217;s so good.</p>\n<p>The next story is <strong>&#8220;Come Moonrise&#8221; by Lucy Monroe</strong>. You can probably guess by the title that it involves <del datetime=\"2010-05-21T17:08:33+00:00\">furries</del> werewolves. They&#8217;re hot recently, though not as hot as vamps (IRONY LOL &#8212; get it? Cause vamps are dead&#8230;they don&#8217;t have body heat. They&#8217;re cold. Get it? &#8230;.you guys all suck).</p>\n<p>The story follows two best friends, Ty and&#8230;fuck, I&#8217;ve forgotten her name already. Probably because I was pretty drunk when I read the story. Anyway. Whatserface has been in love with Ty for like, ever (hello shades of my past! How are you doing? Would you like some tea?) but all he has ever shown her was callous indifference, coupled with a need to never see her get hurt. Gee, sounds just like my ex-boyfriends (Vietnam/Desert Storm), who didn&#8217;t love me but &#8220;cared about me&#8221; enough to emotionally manipulate me into falling for them over and over, only to break my heart multiple times.</p>\n<p>But. I digress.</p>\n<p>So, there&#8217;s a falling out between Ty&#8217;s and whatever&#8217;s families because of her cousin, who&#8217;s a bitch (women are evil bitches! Don&#8217;t trust them!) but a human one (lol get it? cause they&#8217;re werewolves&#8230;bitch for female dog. It&#8217;s funny. Really. Trust me. &#8230;you guys still suck.). So female heroine goes over to visit even though she&#8217;s just been told by her aunt that this is a Bad Idea and that Ty is interested in this little French-Canadian bitch who just moved in (bitch here used literally, and also, hello, shades of my life) so Female Heroine Whose Name Is Not That Important should just give up on her quest for his love, right now.</p>\n<p>She doesn&#8217;t, natch. People are stupid when they&#8217;re in love. Or just in romance novels, you know. Anyway. She goes over and somehow she and Ty end up going to Olivia&#8217;s (the French Canadian) and seriously why can I not remember the heroine&#8217;s name it&#8217;s really fucking bugging me ANYWAY they are there because main character is a vet and Olivia&#8217;s horse is about to foal (seriously, how the fuck do werewolves keep horses? HAVE YOU SEEN HOW A HORSE REACTS TO A WOLF? It is NOT pretty, let me tell you) and Slartibartfast (I&#8217;m just going to call her this from now on, with apologies to Douglas Adams) is like, SuperVet, or some shit.</p>\n<p>So she and Ty help the horse foal and then drive home but it&#8217;s stormy, and Ty is acting more and more like a jerk, and then they&#8217;re in an accident OH NOES and they walk in the snow to a cabin where they can stay until a rescue comes. Ty is progressively more bitchy, and it is literally PMS because it&#8217;s almost full moon and his change is coming upon him (&#8220;Tonight, on a very special <em>Blossom</em>.&#8221;). Also, the scent of a woman who is ovulating, or &#8220;in heat&#8221; LOL DOG JOKE, drives him nuts and makes him need to hump things. It would be charming if it weren&#8217;t a recipe for rape.</p>\n<p>SOMEHOW Slartibartfast ends up in bed with him even though she started out on the couch, and BAMSEX. All. Night. Long. Until neither can move.</p>\n<p>Now, what she doesn&#8217;t know, is that this is essentially the same as marriage &#8212; they are now mated for life because they had sex. (Also, yes, Ty was a virgin up until then but somehow he&#8217;s incredibly skilled, making her orgasm multiple times with JUST HIS THOUGHTS, which is not true to life <em>at all</em> if some of the virgins I&#8217;ve fucked are anything to go by BUT AGAIN I DIGRESS).</p>\n<p>The next morning, they fuck again, and then when she says she loves him he FREAKS THE FUCK OUT and starts pulling all this emotional manipulation crap on her, which was all very familiar to me and had me screaming at the page &#8220;Oh my gods, girl, run, run now, for the love of FUCK RUN!!!!!!!&#8221;</p>\n<p>Instead she takes a bath. Not my first choice. But. I am not a heroine in a paranormal romance &#8212; I act sensibly with dudes.<sup>1</sup> This is why I will be alone until the day I die.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s some more emotional abuse until he&#8217;s finally ready to admit that he loves her and always has (AWWWWWWW) but is pissed off that she &#8220;gave her body&#8221; to someone else before him (*vomit*) and also is willing to stand the wrath of his father, who literally wants to tear his throat out (I am using <em>literally</em> correctly; the pack law was that if you mated a human YOU DIED BITCH) in order to be with her, and wooooo happiness forever. Cause she&#8217;s gonna have some puppies, aww, yeah, everyone loves puppies.</p>\n<p>So. Aside from the forgiving of his jerkish behavior, which was dumb, and the whole &#8220;Twue Love(TM) = virginity before marriage yay!Christianvalues!&#8221; the characters did actually seem real. You know, aside from one being a werewolf. And the sex was really hot. Overall I was interested in the story.</p>\n<p><strong>3.5 stars. </strong></p>\n<p>And now, patient and loyal readers (all two of you), I bring you to the coup de grace. (No, there&#8217;s no accent on the a because I am fracking lazy, just deal with it, plebs.)</p>\n<p>The last story in this collection was <strong>&#8220;Beyond Limits&#8221; by Susan Kearney.</strong> BEYOND THE LIMITS OF MY TOLERANCE FOR STUPIDITY AND MISOGYNY, I mean to say. That is the full, unabridged title, only released to people with brains.</p>\n<p>I have to admit, I stopped reading this story <em>before the first sex scene</em>. I could not handle the sheer levels of misogynistic thinking or two-dimensional character depth. I gave up and skipped ahead to read the last few sentences and confirm my suspicions. Life is too short to read crap, which is why I&#8217;m reviewing it here for you. SO YOU CAN BE SPARED MY FATE.</p>\n<p>This is another story set in the New Atlantis world. Prepped by the first story in the book about this magical fairy land of unicorns with huge dildoes for horns, we are somewhat prepared when Samantha&#8217;s pilot Ian reveals that he is from there, and she&#8217;s his soul mate.</p>\n<p>What I wasn&#8217;t prepared for was him actually being some dude named Ari who had shapeshifted into Ian in order to kidnap Samantha and crash land her fracking plane in the ocean, near a sandy atoll, so he could force her to trust him.</p>\n<p>Are you vomiting? Get yourself a towel. I&#8217;ll wait.</p>\n<p>Oh, we&#8217;re all back. Well, we left off with Ari kidnapping Samantha &#8212; not only did he impersonate her pilot and put her life in danger, but he also stalked her for a year in preparation of this heist and disabled the black box on her airplane. So no one can find her. Ever. He tells her her life is in danger unless she learns to shapeshift, like he can, and that in order to learn this arcane skill, she must first trust him.</p>\n<p>Despite her &#8220;annoyance&#8221; with his behavior, Samantha finds herself attracted to this dude cause he&#8217;s from like Grecian stock or whatever and desperately wants to bone him, even though he&#8217;s demonstrating all the classic signs of an abuser.</p>\n<p>SERIOUSLY WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE.</p>\n<p>There is a name for what Samantha goes through with this dude: it is called Stockholm Syndrome, and it is not sexy. Ever. At all. Ari alternates his abuse with caring attention so that she gets roped in with the classic tropes of &#8220;Oh, but you only see his bad side &#8212; when we&#8217;re alone he&#8217;s different!&#8221; and &#8220;No, I just fell from a palm tree, really,&#8221; or &#8220;He didn&#8217;t mean any harm when he erased the SOS from the sand that it took me several hours of hard work to build, even though I have a limited supply of water with me and will die within the week if no rescue comes, thereby making me totally dependent on him,&#8221; and &#8220;But I can&#8217;t leave him I&#8217;M TRAPPED ON A FUCKING ISLAND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE\u00a0CARIBBEAN.&#8221;</p>\n<p>All familiar, I&#8217;m sure. (Well, some of them at least. Not all of us get trapped on sandy atolls by Adonis-like men who only want our trust because they love us. *swoons* What? Where was I? Oh, right, I&#8217;m a feminist. *slaps self* Much better. Carrying on.)</p>\n<p>Instead of doing what most normal human beings, and probably some mammals (except Chimpanzees, they&#8217;re douchecanoes), would do in order to get to know a potential mate &#8212; you know, go to her place of work, pee on the corners of the building, maybe ask her out to coffee &#8212; Ari stalks and kidnaps her. He does this because &#8220;You&#8217;re such a high-powered businesswoman, Samantha, that there are all these walls up around you and it&#8217;s hard to get to know you. You needed your walls torn down so you could see <em>real love</em>! You know, the love that takes you away from all you know <em>without your consent</em> and puts you in a situation that could kill you unless you form a codependency with me, so that you can never, ever leave me. Ever. That&#8217;s real love. Not dating or getting to know people. That&#8217;s a lie fed to you by the patriarchal agenda. You need to become a real woman by coming to New Atlantis with me and living in slavish\u00a0obedience\u00a0to me. Really, you&#8217;ll like it. Trust me.&#8221;</p>\n<p>RARGABRLGE.</p>\n<p>WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS I DON&#8217;T EVEN</p>\n<p>In the end, Samantha goes to New Atlantis with him because she&#8217;s been so abused and scarred she doesn&#8217;t know how to function in the real world anymore, and &#8220;he needs me&#8221;. (Also, I have a question: how the fuck does shape-shifting help feed the forcefield around New Atlantis? It&#8217;s like the most useless superpower ever. The fuck.)</p>\n<p>I tried to find the epilogue where he murders her and wears her skin as a shirt, but it was sadly lacking. Perhaps in the sequel, where he goes searching for more &#8220;soul mates&#8221; that he can capture, abuse, and rape, and then kill when he&#8217;s done with them? Certainly looking forward to <em>that</em>, I mean what a <em>great escape</em> from the real world where that sort of thing never ever happens am I right?</p>\n<p>Damn women. Being such uppity bitches with their careers and own lives. Need to take them down a notch.</p>\n<p>*notices blue lines under her skin, heading to her heart*</p>\n<p>AUGH THE MISOGYNY IT&#8217;S POISONING ME!!!!!!!</p>\n<p>*goes and reads some Solanas; blue lines disappear*</p>\n<p>Ahhh, that&#8217;s better.</p>\n<p>Oh, right, the stars.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m going to give you my score with a quote from one of my favorite Objectification of Milla Jovovich films:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>Listen to me right here, ok Aknot?

She&#8217;s a terrible, clumsy writer. She is worse than Meyer. It&#8217;s very obvious that, in James&#8217; POV, <em>50 Shades and Christian Grey are a hot fantasy</em> &#8212; and that is what these books are popular as.

I don&#8217;t talk much about the times I&#8217;ve been raped. Not publicly, at least. But I think it&#8217;s time to talk about the second time. Because it&#8217;s relevant to this discussion.</p>\n<p>There is a sex scene in <em>Fifty Shades Darker</em> that is <strong><em>almost exactly like</em></strong> what I went through the second time I was raped. Almost verbatim. Change some names, and some circumstances, and <strong>you&#8217;ve got what my ex did to me in June, 2010 while he was visiting me during my mother&#8217;s cancer surgery.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not going to describe it; it&#8217;s in one of the recaps posts, and Jennifer Armintrout does call it out as rape, so if you want to go find it you know where to look now. The day I read that post I had to do some serious self-care to get through the day. (This is not Jennifer Armintrout&#8217;s fault; there&#8217;s no way she can know what is <em>specifically triggering</em> to folks in a book series that is just <strong>scene after scene</strong> of rapey abuse, and I know what I signed up for when I started reading the recaps.)</p>\n<p>Glorifying rapist characters as a way to create romance is <em>totally</em> deserving of an award! <del>That&#8217;s why <em>True Blood</em> has won so many Emmys for &#8220;Best Rapey Vamps&#8221;.</del> I mean, I <em>sure want to see more</em> of that sort of thing. Maybe <em>next</em> time there can be a bunch of not-subtle-at-all anxieties regarding BDSM and seeing the practice of it as sick and wrong and therefore the characters who practice it as sick and wrong, so it can be EVEN MORE like my relationship with my ex-boyfriend.</p>\n<p><em>Oh wait.</em></p>\n<p>Even if the series <em>didn&#8217;t</em> glorify a rapey abusive douchefuck,<strong> it&#8217;s terribly written.</strong> It&#8217;s honestly probably the worst writing I&#8217;ve ever read.<strong> <em>And</em> it&#8217;s plagiarism.</strong> There is an 89% similarity rating between <em>Fifty Shades</em> and the\u00a0 <em>Twilight</em> fanfic it was &#8220;extensively reworked&#8221; from, <em>Master of the Universe</em>. <strong>Eighty. Nine. Per cent.</strong></p>\n<p>That would be enough to get you kicked out of college, but out here in the real world we give you a goddamn publishing contract and slap your name on the shortlist for a fucking medal.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, if <em>Fifty Shades</em> wins the National Book Awards, I think the only reasonable reaction would be to nuke the UK from orbit.

I plan on seeing a doctor this week &#8212; I may have wrenched the shoulder out of alignment <a title=\"Galactica is trying to murder me\" href=\"http://katjevanloon.com/2012/11/04/galactica-is-trying-to-murder-me/\">during Galactica&#8217;s bid to murder me</a>.</p>\n<p>Despite all this <em>sturm und drang</em> surrounding my physical health, I&#8217;m alive, and was feeling well enough on Monday to leave the house for an opportunity to see <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_King_%28novelist%29\">Thomas King</a> speak.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" title=\"King on Stage\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/i1006.photobucket.com/albums/af182/celestial_ironhawk/Blog%20Stuff/kingonstage.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"677\" height=\"544\" /></p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t know who Thomas King is, then <del>get the fuck out</del> you are missing out on part of life.</p>\n<p>Seriously, though, Thomas King is brilliant, and funny, and an amazing writer, and incredibly patient with babbling star-struck First Nations Studies graduates.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 562px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"   \" title=\"babble babble\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/i1006.photobucket.com/albums/af182/celestial_ironhawk/Blog%20Stuff/meetingtomking.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"552\" height=\"415\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">I embarrassed myself.</p></div>\n<p>I got my copy of <em>The Truth About Stories: A Native Narrative</em> signed, and spent time during the presentation basking in the wisdom of Mr. King.</p>\n<p>Favorite quotes of the evening (paraphrased):</p>\n<blockquote><p>Writing fiction is like buttering toast.

(I&#8217;m not counting any of the ones I tried to start in Powell River, for reasons that will have me ranting.) I missed it.</p>\n<p>You may or may not know, but I was a figure in starting up the <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/mauislam\">Maui Slam</a>. The first one was held at Gallerie Ha, but it didn&#8217;t catch on. A bunch of us Maui poets got together to put that one up, and it was a lot of fun. Later, slams became a regular part of Maui arts landscape, hosted at Maui Booksellers &#8212; where I used to work. I ended up winning one slam with my poem WRITER&#8217;S BLOCK. Since then I&#8217;ve written one other poem that I consider a slam poem, though several of mine could be read that way I suppose.</p>\n<p>I admit, I got burned out on slam politics and Russian judges, and started to feel bitter about what the Maui arts community considered &#8220;real&#8221; poetry. Apparently only stuff that works to make the audience feel guilty for breathing. (Hence why WRITER&#8217;S BLOCK won.)</p>\n<p><strong>It&#8217;s different here in Vancouver</strong>. That much was obvious last night. I only caught the last half of the night, but the poems that got the highest scores and best responses from the audience were definitely not about making the audience feel guilty for being human. They were about love and identity and things we can all relate to. <strong>All the poets were skilled, and each poem was a pleasure to listen to.</strong> You can watch them at the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/PoetrySlamVancouver\">slam&#8217;s YouTube channel</a>.</p>\n<p>The MC is amazing and funny and feminist, and continued to make jokes about International Men&#8217;s Day, which it happened to be.</p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t know why International Men&#8217;s Day is a joke, I&#8217;ll give you a hint: <strong>because in a patriarchal kyriarchy, <em>every day</em> is International Men&#8217;s Day</strong>. Even on March 8th, because people don&#8217;t stop being sexist asshats on days designated to give a nod to the oppressed and marginalized.</p>\n<p>Though it does have one purpose: it helped me decide when <a href=\"http://femmesblackmarket.wordpress.com/2012/03/08/calling-for-an-international-non-binary-gender-day/\">International Genderqueer Day</a>* should be held. (July 14th, if you&#8217;re interested. Midpoint between March 8th and November 19th.)</p>\n<p>After the Slam I got to hang out with a bunch of people who put it on, because the friend that I went with is buddies with all of them. I will probably be going to the Slam as often as I can from now on. I had a ton of fun, and I got creatively inspired.</p>\n<p>When I got home, I tried to go to sleep after doing some reading on the internet. My brain wouldn&#8217;t let me, though the painkillers were fast making me fall asleep. <strong>I had a poem to write. </strong></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s called <em>Blood Candle</em>, and it may be ready for an upcoming slam. I think I have to tweak it a bit, not least because I wrote it on my phone while half-asleep and loggy from painkillers, so autocorrect has had a field day with it. Still, I think it&#8217;s good, and I think when polished it could be great.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m still on the mend from my illness, but I should be right as rain by next week. Expect fewer posts from me in the coming days, however. It&#8217;s hard to type with a wrecked shoulder.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>*Note on the blog I&#8217;ve linked to: Fierce Femme&#8217;s Black Market was created with the intention of being a place for me to write about feminist stuff, but since I&#8217;ve decided to just write about that here at Bacon and Whiskey and at <a href=\"http://innocenceandimmanence.wordpress.com/\">Innocence and Immanence</a>, I&#8217;m not really sure what to do with that blog.

Gods, it&#8217;s probably all I ever write.</p>\n<p><strong>What is the one-sentence synopsis of your book?</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Bellica Agate is forced to embrace the past she ran away from in order to save her country, her soldiers, and her marriage.</li>\n<li>When Silva, Goddess of Wolves and Lady of the True Woods, falls to an alien planet and becomes mortal, she must find a new True Woods, stop a war, and save the wolves of Min, or she may never regain her godhood.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Where did you get the idea for the book? </strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>A name. There was a character who was mentioned in <em>Bellica</em>, and from her name(s) I came up with the idea for <em>The Jade Star of Athering</em>. I&#8230;really can&#8217;t give any more information than that without majorly spoiling <em>Bellica</em>; if you&#8217;ve read it, then you can probably guess the character of which I speak.</li>\n<li>I had the idea of a story of a goddess who fell to an alien planet and became mortal while in search of a missing god-friend when I was working on <em>Islands of Fire and Water</em>. Originally, the goddess in my idea was Pele, searching for Lono, but I soon realized the character I was building in my head was nothing like Pele. So I let it sit and percolate for a while, until a few months ago the idea seized my brain, held it hostage, and demanded to be written for NaNoWriMo (even though I&#8217;d not planned on doing NaNo this year). During October I planned, and I decided on Silva and making it a True Woods book, because I was working on publishing <a href=\"https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/253205\"><em>How to Keep a Human</em></a> by Kaimana Wolff &#8212; the first True Woods book.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Who or what inspired you to write this book?</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>The characters in Bellica. I wanted to know more about them; I wanted to continue to write about them. I also wanted to explore loose ends that I&#8217;d left during that story, and see where they lead.</li>\n<li>My mom. She started the True Woods series, and I grew up believing in Silva as the Lady of the True Woods and the Wolves. And I wanted to tell Her story.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>How long did it take you to write the first draft of your manuscript?</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Still not done. I&#8217;ve been working on <em>Jade Star</em> for several years now.</li>\n<li>I&#8217;m going to say 2 months for <em>Stranger Skies</em>. I started in November, and I plan on finishing it by January 1st.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>What other books would you compare this story to within your genre?</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\u00a0I&#8230;really have no idea. <em>Jade Star</em> is sort of standard fantasy: a quest, party members, a nation threatened by war. Except, you know, feminist. So if you know what&#8217;s comparable to that, please tell me, because off the top of my head I&#8217;ve got no clue.</li>\n<li>The <em>Through Wolf&#8217;s Eyes</em> series by Jane Lindskold.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Which actors would you choose to play your characters in a movie rendition?</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Off the top of my head? <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0565973/\">Kandyse McClure</a> for Bellica Agate. She&#8217;s definitely got the right look, and I think she has the acting chops to pull it off. Also I&#8217;ve met her, and she&#8217;s a lovely person. (Yes, I&#8217;ve met actors from BSG. Go ahead. Be jealous.)\u00a0 Beyond that I&#8217;m really not sure who would play Major Damien or Queen Rain-Looking. I don&#8217;t really get a good sense of who I&#8217;d cast in a movie version until I finish a book.</li>\n<li><strong>Thalaea/Silva:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0757855/\">Zoe Saldana</a>, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0628601/\">Thandie Newton</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000505/\">Nia Long</a>. In order of preference. <strong>Brinna:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.amandlastenberg.com/index.html\">Amandla Stenberg</a> (when she&#8217;s a bit older; Brinna is 19). <strong>Scoas</strong>: Idris Elba. <strong>Natai:</strong> Naomie Harris. <strong>Alaev</strong>: Donald Glover. Annnnnd I really want Morris Chestnut to play someone, but no idea who. He doesn&#8217;t really strike me as a Laeanai, but hell, maybe he could do a really good job. (Or Chestnut could play Scoas, and Elba could be Laeanai. Idk.) *kermit-flail*</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&lt;</p>\n<p>p&gt;Side note, it&#8217;s really difficult to remember black actors aside from the five everyone knows or whatever. Racism? Yeah, super-ingrained and programmed in. Hard to shake that shit.</p>\n<p><strong>Will your book be self-published or represented by an agency?</strong></p>\n<p>Neither will be represented by an agency &#8212; or rather, I don&#8217;t plan on that. They&#8217;ll both be published under <a href=\"http://thepackpress.com/\">The Pack Press</a>, as <em>Bellica</em> was. Which is basically self-publishing, because I do all the layout work for The Pack Press.</p>\n<p><del>Wheeeeee it&#8217;s fun not having anyone to delegate to. Watch Katje work zirself to death!</del></p>\n<p><strong>What else about your book might pique the reader\u2019s interest?</strong></p>\n<p>They&#8217;re fucking awesome?</p>\n<p>Also, pagans should take special note, because I posit &#8212; in <em>all</em> of my stories &#8212; that the gods are very real and They matter. Because They are, Morrigan-dammit.\u00a0 (Yes, yes, I totally respect your beliefs if you don&#8217;t believe in god, or gods, or whatever, but <em>I do</em>, and other pagans who do believe in the gods <em>as real beings</em> may find special interest in my books because I <em>don&#8217;t</em> write off deities as fantasy.)</p>\n<p>Lovers of wolves would really like&#8230;well, actually, both books, because there&#8217;s a wolf or two in <em>Jade Star</em>, too.</p>\n<p>Definite Mayan feel to <em>Jade Star</em>.</p>\n<p>Humongous snake-people in <em>Stranger Skies</em>. Also, Brighid saying She&#8217;d like to snog someone. And queer gods. And witches. Oh, and the wolves can shapeshift. They&#8217;re not werewolves, though. They&#8217;re wolfweres. (Wolf first.

Deal with it.</p>\n<p>Fact 2: <strong>There is nothing wrong with using make-up or any of these other products</strong>, but make sure you&#8217;re using them for the <em>right reasons</em>.</p>\n<p>It took me a long time to realize that the reason I was using make-up was <strong><em>fucked up</em></strong>. I was using it so I&#8217;d be more attractive to the opposite sex. I was using it <em>so boys would like me</em>.</p>\n<p>I wasn&#8217;t alone. A lot of my friends, when I was growing up, would put make-up on <em>before going to sleep</em> so they&#8217;d wake up looking &#8220;fresh and beautiful&#8221;. This was especially true at any sort of slumber-party-type-event (yes, I went to those well into high school, shut up).</p>\n<p>At some point, I clued in: <strong>if a dude didn&#8217;t like me without my make-up, he didn&#8217;t deserve to be with me, around me, near me, or in contact with me</strong>.</p>\n<p>But I didn&#8217;t stop wearing it. I stopped wearing it <em>every day</em>, but I&#8217;ve never stopped wearing make up, or shaving my legs, or painting my nails.</p>\n<p>Not for <em>beauty.</em> These things do not constitute a <em>beauty regimen</em> for me &#8212; <strong>my only beauty regimen is being my own fabulous self, because I&#8217;m fucking gorgeous already.</strong></p>\n<p>No, I have my own reasons for doing these things. I shave my legs because when they&#8217;re hairy, they&#8217;re boar&#8217;s hair hairy, and the feeling of clothing on that is shudder-inducing. I also prefer being able to rub clean-shaven legs together. (I have Things about textures.)</p>\n<p>I wear nail polish because I think having painted nails makes my hands look more defined, and also <em>OOOOHHH PRETTY COLORS SO SHINY MUST HAVE ALL OF THEM YES PRECIOUS.</em></p>\n<p><strong>I wear make-up</strong> because, again, <em>shiny glittery hoard hoard hoard</em>, but also <strong>because I view it as armor</strong>. (Same goes for nail polish, too, to a certain extent.)</p>\n<p>I have depression and anxiety. These things can get <em>really</em> bad for me. Sometimes they prevent me from leaving the house. <em>Often,</em> they prevent me from leaving the house. Or getting <em>anything</em> done.</p>\n<p>But on really bad days where I <em>have</em> to go out, be adult, be responsible, because no one else will do it or can do it for me? <strong>Make-up is a life-saver.</strong> Being able to put on some eyeliner and powder and shadow along with my dark, baggy sweater and my dark, baggy jeans, and my dark, baggy hoodie gives me armor against the world. <strong>It&#8217;s a signal to my lizard brain that Katje isn&#8217;t leaving the house unprotected.</strong> My soft underbelly isn&#8217;t open to weapons; I am shielded from what the world might bring against me because the world <em>cannot</em> <em>see my real face</em>.</p>\n<p>Make-up isn&#8217;t a beauty regimen for me. <strong>It&#8217;s a warrior regimen</strong>. It&#8217;s my equivalent to putting on plate (my equivalent to a sword is my metal cane, currently) and a helm. It protects me from a world that&#8217;s hurt me too many times. So in that respect, it truly is a <em>regimen:</em> putting on make-up does wonders for my <em>mental</em> health.</p>\n<p><strong>I feel powerful when I slap on some lipstick. I feel strong when I wear eyeshadow. I feel like nothing can touch me when I have rose-scented powder on my face.</strong> (Rose-scented cosmetics from <a href=\"http://www.annasui.com/\">Anna Sui</a> = suddenly everything was perfect, and nothing hurt.)</p>\n<p><em>That</em> is a much better reason to wear make up than to make sure boys will like me.<strong> And it has abso-fucking-lutely nothing to do with </strong><em><strong>beauty.</strong><br />\n</em></p>\n<p>So if you wear make-up, shave your legs, whatever, ask yourself <em>why.</em> I respect your choice to do so <em>no matter what,</em> but I really hope that your beauty regimen, or whatever you want to call it, is <strong>all for you and no one else.</strong> If other folks give you shit for wearing sweatpants and having your hair back in a ponytail, that&#8217;s <em>their</em> baggage and their projection issues &#8212; not an accurate assessment you doing things wrong. You ain&#8217;t. Don&#8217;t let the bastards grind you down.</p>\n<p><strong>You&#8217;re the only person you&#8217;re going to have a lifelong relationship with. Stop shortchanging yourself. Do things <em>for you</em>. You&#8217;re fucking gorgeous and amazing. Act like it.</strong></p>\n", "post_id": 3440, "location": false, "date": "01-10-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Silva", "stories: Stranger Skies", "True Names"], "text": "<p>I&#8217;m finally doing this again!</p>\n<p>I started work on <em>Stranger Skies</em> again this week, and decided I should start posting snippets again &#8212; if only to keep myself motivated.

This year started out with a week of depression, anxiety attacks, and severe suicidal thoughts. It&#8217;s gotten a bit better, but I&#8217;ve still be battling the mother of all depressive episodes for the past 3 weeks.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve wanted to cut again. I&#8217;ve thought about taking up smoking. I&#8217;ve pictured hanging myself or blowing my brains out. I&#8217;ve even considered od&#8217;ing on my antidepressants, which I haven&#8217;t been able to take since December because my body suddenly decided to add them to the food allergies list that is mercurial and ever growing larger.</p>\n<p>I have no idea what od&#8217;ing on zoloft might do, but I considered it, because honestly the results seemed better than dealing with the shit that&#8217;s been going down this month.</p>\n<p>And all this, mind you, <strong>is after <a href=\"http://www.moragspinner.net/2012/11/30/pagan-blog-project-x-or-the-gift-of-poison/\">my brush with death that made me realize I wanted, truly, very desperately <em>wanted,</em> to live</a>.</strong></p>\n<p>January 1st I went 500 dollars into the red, because Student Loans took money out of my account. No warning. Two days later, I get a note from VIU: I&#8217;m not graduating at the end of January, because I&#8217;m missing 6 credits.</p>\n<p>Did they tell me this six fucking months ago when I applied to graduate? No. They wait until 2 days into the new year. A few weeks before convocation.</p>\n<p>This, of course, means that <strong>I can no longer go to SFU this semester</strong>, after I&#8217;ve already worked <em>so hard</em> to get accepted. They were accepting me based on me receiving my degree from VIU this month. Without that, I am no longer enrolled; if I want to enroll <em>not</em> as a second bachelors&#8217; student, but as a transfer student, I can do that &#8212; for Fall 2013. After going through the registration process again.</p>\n<p>And this &#8212; this suddenly blowing in the wind, not being a student when I was supposed to be &#8212; this of course now means that I cannot have my loans or interest-free status this semester. So what my immediate course of action was going to be &#8212; finishing my application for Student Loans for this semester &#8212; to resolve the money issue can no longer happen.</p>\n<p>I called Student Loans this morning about my issue. Basically, it is <em>sort of</em> fixable &#8212; I have to fill out a bunch of forms in triplicate proving I&#8217;m as poor as I say I am, and then I&#8217;ll probably qualify for reduced payments, perhaps even to zero. I&#8217;ll know within 4 days of sending back the form, which should arrive by the end of this week? Possibly?</p>\n<p>I also discovered that the <em>reason</em> Student Loans was under the impression that I owed them money <em>as of November</em> was because VIU told them I withdrew from courses as of April. Which I didn&#8217;t. I withdrew from courses in <em>June, </em>when I was informed that <em>I didn&#8217;t need the other two courses</em> I was enrolled in that summer.</p>\n<p>At any rate, I was supposed to be starting classes again this month &#8212; so really, there should only have been 2 weeks in the period of <em>ok, you&#8217;ve been out of class long enough, pay up</em>.</p>\n<p>The<strong> too long; didn&#8217;t read</strong> version of all this? <strong>My life is fucking shambles and right now I am very seriously questioning whether I want my degree from VIU at all.</strong> VIU is a school that has <em>repeatedly</em> proven it cares little to nothing about its students. They have completely screwed me in the past year &#8212; TWICE now &#8212; and their lack of communication skills is LEGENDARY.</p>\n<p>I have been tearing my hair out for weeks; studiously trying to solve my problems via avoidance and escapism because my brain cannot deal with the level of suckage going on without going into complete shut-down, depressive/suicidal episode mode; sleeping far too much or far too little as my body goes into emergency coping mode. I am wandering, an errant leaf on the wind, wondering what the fuck am I going to do with my life now?</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve now been working at my first degree, my first, four-year, Bachelor&#8217;s Degree, for 10 years. A decade of my life that I&#8217;m not getting back. And furthermore, most of the credits for my degree at VIU are non-transferable.</p>\n<p>So now I face the question: do I suck it up, move back to Nanaimo in summer time (<strong>which means, inevitably, <em>living out of my car</em> and being basically homeless for four months</strong>, and this is what I was facing at the beginning of <em>this</em> month, for <em>this</em> semester) and do these last two courses (when I&#8217;m not even 100% sure that they&#8217;ll be <em>offered</em> this summer, or that I can get <em>any</em> funding)? Or do I say fuck it, transfer what can be transferred to SFU, and start from scratch?</p>\n<p><del>Alternatively, I suddenly sell millions of copies of my book/win the lotto and quit school forever.</del></p>\n<p><strong>Wherein Katje rattles about in uncertainty and possibly some despair, though mostly just numbness at this point, <em>for the rest of zir life</em>.</strong></p>\n<p>I suppose, however, I can count my blessings &#8212; at least this huge fucking fiasco, this shambles that is my life, has given me plot bunnies for new stories. &#8220;Hooray,&#8221; zie said <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzfdVbClqAA\">exactly as Archer would</a>.</p>\n", "post_id": 3446, "location": false, "date": "01-16-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["True Names", "stories: Stranger Skies"], "text": "<p><a title=\"SFFSat, January 12th, 2013: Silva finds her new True Name\" href=\"http://katjevanloon.com/2013/01/11/sffsat-january-12th-2013-silva-finds-her-new-true-name/\">Last week</a>, Silva found her new True Name: Thalaea.

The <em>Acorna</em> series by Anne McCaffrey. The unicorn girl needs to<em><strong> die</strong></em>.</p>\n<p><em>Acorna the Unicorn Girl</em> was great. It was fun, and well written, with lovable characters. She&#8217;s a fucking unicorn girl! Awesome! She&#8217;s got a horn and shit! Super-awesome!</p>\n<p>The first book made me want to read the second, and the third, which were also good. After we found Acorna&#8217;s peeps and it becomes apparent that she&#8217;s not just a freakish mutant, I think, &#8220;Yeah, okay, we&#8217;re good now.&#8221;</p>\n<p>BUT WAIT. THERE&#8217;S MORE.</p>\n<p>After she meets her people, there&#8217;s a new novel: <em>Acorna&#8217;s World</em>. I honestly don&#8217;t remember fuck all from it because I was already so done with the damn thing.</p>\n<p>You know, it would be easier to follow Acorna around on her many adventures if she wasn&#8217;t&#8230;the same throughout the books. She doesn&#8217;t grow as a character. ACORNA NOBLE. ACORNA STRONG. ACORNA CHOSEN ONE OF UNICORN PEOPLE. ACORNA KNOWN AS SWEET-TITS IN LIAAAAARRRYYYRYRYYYRYYRIIIRIRIRIIRI LANGUAGE.</p>\n<p>It would also be more believable if there wasn&#8217;t one totally &#8220;good&#8221; species vs. one totally &#8220;bad&#8221; species. McCaffrey does this&#8230;a lot, actually, and it&#8217;s fucking annoying. Stay away from aliens, McCaffrey. Stick to humans; you&#8217;re better at that.</p>\n<p>But I digress. <em>Acorna&#8217;s World</em>! Oh my god unicorns! And stuff! Fuck if I know!</p>\n<p>On to the next book!</p>\n<p>At some point during this one Aari goes missing, I think. Through time travel and shit. Time travel through the water of a planet &#8212; I do not know how that works, or what Anne was smoking when she wrote the goddamn book.</p>\n<p>Who&#8217;s Aari? Good question. He&#8217;s some tortured Linynyiaiiairiirirhoweverthefuckyouspellit UNICORN MAN who is Acorna&#8217;s lifemate. Yes, the Unicorn Folk mate for life. This is stupid. Anyway.</p>\n<p>Aari got the shit beat out of him by the EVIL KHLEEVI (she came up with these names while playing Boggle, I swear) and is all Nam-veteran PTSD-y. (Not to make light of the plight of Nam-vets at all, but Aari makes me think of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Happy_Tree_Friends_characters#Flippy\">this guy</a>.)</p>\n<p>The book in which Aari gets himself lost is called <em>Acorna&#8217;s Search</em>.</p>\n<p>How original. She&#8217;s searching for Aari. We shall name the book after this pertinent fact.</p>\n<p>Actually it&#8217;s a complete misnomer, because she doesn&#8217;t really begin her search in earnest until the end of the book.</p>\n<p>I did not read <em>Acorna&#8217;s Rebels</em>, because at that point I&#8217;d started to vehemently wish horrible things upon the unicorn bitch and frankly did not give a frack whether she found Aari or he died in the past and she lived alone for the rest of her life (which I also hoped was very short). It&#8217;s a complicated emotion.</p>\n<p>According to Wiki Acorna does not find Aari in this book &#8212; she fucks off to Makahomia, where her friend RK the cat is a temple cat, and OH NOES THE KITTEHS ARE SICK WILL YOU HELPS THEM ACORNA?</p>\n<p>And she does. Of course. Because she never, ever looks at all the shit she has to do and says &#8220;I&#8217;m tired. Everyone can die for all I care.&#8221; Because she&#8217;s fucking SUPER UNICORN. Her brother was Sparkle Lord.</p>\n<p>And apparently while saving teh kittehs from teh sickness she finds some clues to help find her lifemate.</p>\n<p>That can&#8217;t happen in this book, though. No. We need a new one! It&#8217;s called&#8230;.</p>\n<p><em>Acorna&#8217;s Triumph</em>!</p>\n<p>Guess what.</p>\n<p>She triumphs.</p>\n<p>by which I mean she finds Aari and bones him senseless, because then after this book (which, so far, is the last of the Acorna series I HOPE PLEASE GODS LET IT END) there are three books about her children.</p>\n<p>I hope the Khleevi eat them.</p>\n", "post_id": 357, "location": false, "date": "08-12-2010", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Story Bible", "Mr. Katje", "Atreeeeeyyyyuuuuuuuuuu", "writing", "crazed whiskey-driven penmonkey", "bucketlist"], "text": "<div id=\"attachment_1775\" style=\"width: 250px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://writersbucketlist.com/blog-hop/challenge/\"><img class=\"wp-image-1775 \" title=\"Bucket List Challenge Blog Hop\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://danasitar.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/bucket-list-blog-hop-badge.jpg?w=240&#038;h=240\" width=\"240\" height=\"240\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Click the image to see the other bloggers participating in the hop!</p></div>\n<p>Everyone should have a bucket list, I think &#8212; that list of essential things one must do in one&#8217;s lifetime.

And I think it should be never ending. <strong>Hopefully life is interesting enough that once you cross things off your bucket list there are more you want to add.</strong></p>\n<p>I just got finished reading <a href=\"http://danasitar.com/2013/02/05/new-ebook-for-writers/\">Dana Sitar</a>&#8216;s <a href=\"http://writersbucketlist.com/\"><em>A Writer&#8217;s Bucket List</em></a>, and I quite liked it. I decided to participate in the Bucket List Challenge Blog Hop &#8212; that is, I&#8217;m challenging myself to cross some things off my bucket list this year.</p>\n<p>Not everything on this list will be writing-specific. In fact, possibly most of it won&#8217;t. I have a lot of writing-related things on my bucket list, but many of them are more long-term. For this year I have other, shorter-term bucket list goals I can tackle.</p>\n<h3>What <del>your</del> <del>lovable</del> <del>angry</del> <del>favourite furry monster pal</del> crazed, whiskey-driven penmonkey Katje is going to cross of zir bucket list in 2013</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Learn how to bake bread.</strong> This is something I&#8217;ve wanted to do for a long time now, and <a href=\"http://www.moragspinner.net/2013/01/24/bread/\">I&#8217;ve decided 2013 is the year for it</a>. It&#8217;s my hope that once I know the ins and outs of baking bread with wheat flour, I&#8217;ll be able to find or create the perfect gluten-free bread recipe. (Someday, I will make a GF loaf of bread that will fool even Mr. Katje.)</li>\n<li><strong>Co-write a book with my mom.</strong> Specifically, a cookbook of gluten-free traditional Dutch recipes. We&#8217;re going to spend this year developing the recipes &#8212; finding that exact right mix of ingredients to create the perfect GF <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontbijtkoek\"><b>ontbijtkoek</b></a>, for example, or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculoos\">speculoos</a>. (I&#8217;m a koek-junkie. Can&#8217;t get enough of the stuff. If we can find a way to make it GF <em>and</em> just as delicious as normal? My life will turn into unicorns and rainbows.)</li>\n<li><strong>Knit a sweater. With or without a pattern.</strong> Patterns are my bane, but I&#8217;ve always wanted to knit a sweater.

(I love <em>Bellica,</em> but man, after a million+ edits and ebook formats, I get to a point where my brain is screaming <em>CAN WE JUST MOVE ON ALREADY?</em>) I should do this for <em>Stranger Skies</em> this year, too, come to think of it &#8212; but the <em>Bellica / Jade Star</em> one takes precedence at the moment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I think 5 is enough for one year. It&#8217;s already promising to be a very busy&#8230;<em>eleven</em> months, now, so I&#8217;m going to try and not overload myself too much. I&#8217;d rather make a <em>few</em> commitments I <em>can</em> keep than make too many and have to de-commit, or miss deadline.

I put in a <em>read more</em> tag so that you can skip this if you want.)</p>\n<p><strong>1.</strong> I&#8217;ve been through domestic violence. Several times. I grew up with an abusive father who abused my mother and me for years, even after an 11-year divorce that got heralded as Second Worst in my province&#8217;s history (no, I&#8217;m not joking). I finally cut him out of my life last year when I turned 26, but that doesn&#8217;t repair the 2.5 decades of damage he&#8217;s done, nor has it stopped him from continuing to try and contact me, including using my sister to get at me.</p>\n<p>I also had a series of abusive relationships with boyfriends that got worse and worse (until, like a godsdamned angel falling to the ground in front of me, the Ogre appeared in my life, and I&#8217;m never letting him go).</p>\n<p>The second guy I dated tortured me for six months &#8212; long distance, no less &#8212; under the guise of BDSM. His actions had me breaking down in tears daily, wondering how I could be a better sub for him. <strong>He made me believe I was worthless, a dirty whore that didn&#8217;t deserve him.</strong> I had several nervous breakdowns at school. I changed my life and my plans to suit what he wanted, until finally he dumped me. Just as I thought I might be a bit better, just as I thought I could breathe again, he came back into my life and started the mental torture again. That lasted for two months, until he told me he&#8217;d never had any feelings for me, that his story about wanting to marry me had just been to get into my pants, that I was a cheap fuck, and a distraction while he pursued the only woman worth his time. When I cried, and said he was breaking my heart, he told me to stop having a pity party and hung up on me.</p>\n<p><strong>I still can&#8217;t say his name out loud without having a panic attack. I have nightmares about him. </strong></p>\n<p>That was in February, 2009. I spent months healing as best I could, until I was happy being single, until I could actually function. I only cried sometimes. I finally realized that he&#8217;d abused me, and that helped a lot.</p>\n<p>In September of that year, I became friends with a new guy in the theatre program at VIU. In fact, for a while I was his only friend &#8212; he had a habit of alienating people by being a douchebag, but I gave him the benefit of the doubt. <strong>I should have noticed his horrible habit of never respecting peoples&#8217; boundaries. I didn&#8217;t. I was younger and more foolish back then.</strong></p>\n<p>We ended up dating, but it was tumultuous from the get-go. We&#8217;d already been sleeping together for a while, and I was in love with him by this point. He had no such feelings for me; instead he only slept with me until he could convince the girls he really liked to go out with him. They didn&#8217;t want to, so eventually we started going out because I was a good consolation prize, I guess.</p>\n<p>The abuse was emotional and religious. <strong>He told me I was stupid daily, and he continually disrespected my altar, my gods, and my faith, and made subtle comments that said, pretty clearly, that he viewed me as a pagan whore who was corrupting his pure Christian soul.</strong> One of the biggest points of contention in our relationship was that I felt he was ashamed of me: he refused to be in a relationship with me on Facebook, for one, and he seemed to gloss over the fact that we were dating whenever we were out.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I just don&#8217;t like PDAs.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re just labels; they don&#8217;t matter.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He went home for Christmas, and when he came back I knew something was different. He&#8217;d cheated on me, and continued to &#8212; with a girl in <em>Nova fucking Scotia</em>, which takes talent really &#8212; until finally telling me and dumping me on Valentine&#8217;s Day.</p>\n<p>Within a week, he was dating her &#8212; even went so far as to change their relationship status on FB. I told him we were friends off, but he wouldn&#8217;t leave me alone. <strong>He kept forcing himself back into my life, no matter how much I tried to cut him off, and gods help me, I let him.</strong> Because I was still in love.</p>\n<p>He cheated on her with me, too, multiple times. I kept believing, stupidly, that if we just had sex one more time he&#8217;d love me and everything would change. He wouldn&#8217;t call me stupid any more. He would respect my religious choices. I wouldn&#8217;t have to cry every day.</p>\n<p>Finally at the end of spring semester I moved back to my mom&#8217;s house, a ferry ride and 2 hour drive away. Finally, I didn&#8217;t have to see him every day anymore. Finally, I could start to get some closure.</p>\n<p>And I did. <strong>I even got to a point where I wasn&#8217;t in love with him anymore, and felt we maybe could be friends. He came to visit me during my mom&#8217;s cancer surgery that summer, and then he raped me.</strong></p>\n<p>The point of this story is that when I read the excerpts of <em>Fifty Shades of Grey</em> on Jenny Trout&#8217;s blog, I had flashbacks to my relationships with these two men. <strong>When I read the &#8220;sex&#8221; scene in chapter 15 of <em>Fifty Shades Darker</em>, I got triggered, because it was almost exactly like what happened when my ex-boyfriend raped me</strong>. It took me a full day to recover.</p>\n<p>So <strong>don&#8217;t fucking tell me that saying your books glorify domestic abuse &#8220;trivializes&#8221; the issue, EL James.</strong> Abuse is not just beatings and yelling; it can be so subtle that not even your friends know what you&#8217;re going through. And <strong>when women who have suffered abuse tell you that it&#8217;s in your books, maybe you should shut your fucking mouth and learn to listen</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Saying the relationship in your books is abusive does not demonize women who are into BDSM or kink. This is because a) there is more to a relationship than just BDSM, and b) most actual fucking kinksters are saying the BDSM in the books is wrong and/or abusive.</strong></p>\n<p>I&#8217;m a kinky pervert, EL James. I&#8217;ve been into BDSM since I was 19, and in that time I&#8217;ve done some kinky shit. Honestly most of the sex that Christian and Ana have is downright vanilla by my standards. There&#8217;s not much they do that I would even call kinky.</p>\n<p>So, as a kinky pervert who has also suffered domestic violence, can I just tell you to go fuck yourself? (Oh, damn, there went the civility. Oh well. Not like you were particularly civil yourself, anyway.) <strong>It&#8217;s not the BDSM that I take issue with.</strong> If I took issue with BDSM in erotic romance books, I wouldn&#8217;t love the <em>Kushiel</em> Series so goddamned much.</p>\n<p><strong>It&#8217;s the parts of the relationship where Christian coerces, manipulates, drugs, yells at, insults, or hurts Ana. It&#8217;s the parts where she&#8217;s <em>terrified</em> of him beating her, where she&#8217;s <em>terrified</em> of his temper, where she minds her Ps and Qs so she won&#8217;t piss off her husband.</strong></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s the parts where he ignores her lack of consent and just does whatever he wants to her &#8212; like making marks on her body because she sunbathed topless. <em>Marking her as his property. Not</em> in a sexy, consensual way.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve had hickies and I fucking love them. I often ask the Ogre to try and make them on my neck. But if he starts to try and make one and I don&#8217;t want one at that point in time, because I have to do something the next day or whatever and don&#8217;t need bruises on my neck? I ask him to stop. And he fucking does, because he respects and values me as his equal, and he always respects when I withdraw my consent for something.</p>\n<p><strong>Reading <em>Fifty Shades of Grey</em>, I actually wondered if you had spied on my past relationships and used my exes as fodder for your Christian Grey, EL James.</strong> There is domestic abuse plastered all over the books, and while Christian does use BDSM as an excuse to abuse Ana, it&#8217;s not &#8212; in general &#8212; the &#8220;lifestyle&#8221; with which I take issue. (Side note: if you&#8217;d done your research or if you knew anything about BDSM, you&#8217;d know that there a lot of kinksters who take issue with the term &#8220;lifestyle&#8221; to refer to what they do.) I&#8217;ve survived over 25 years of abuse in my life, EL James. I know what the fuck I&#8217;m talking about.</p>\n<p><strong>It&#8217;s not the BDSM. It&#8217;s the abuse.</strong></p>\n<p>And when you block people on Twitter for bringing it to your attention, when you call domestic violence survivors <em>trolls</em> and <em>witches</em> for trying to raise awareness, all while saying out of the other side of your mouth how much you care about those poor battered women, <strong>you show us that you really don&#8217;t give a shit about us. You don&#8217;t give a shit about anything except the heaps of money you&#8217;re rolling in.</strong></p>\n<p>That makes you a hypocrite and a terrible person, and I hope that someday the world sees you for what you really are.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, <strong>I will never let myself be silenced.</strong> I will never stop campaigning for awareness of the domestic violence in your books. I will never stop talking about it. No matter if I get suspended from Twitter, as a compatriot of mine did this past week. <strong>No matter if I get threatened with physical violence from your supporters</strong>, as at least two of my tweeps did.

It&#8217;s really difficult.

It&#8217;s <strong>terrifying</strong> every time I write publicly about my depression, especially as the internet is filled with trolls and assholes who <em>live</em> for the chance to hurt someone. Talking about my mental illness in a public venue like this blog is basically giving them ammo and a gun and letting them point it at my head.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">(This post is taking a lot out of me to write.)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I do it anyway. <strong>I talk about these things because the silence must be broken.</strong> We need to stop shaming people for having mental illness. We need to treat those with mental illness with respect, dignity, and love.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">That starts with honest conversations. That starts with ending the silence.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">So, today, let&#8217;s talk. Today, I say: I have depression and anxiety. I&#8217;ve tried to commit suicide several times over the course of my life and I deal with suicidal thoughts often. I&#8217;ve self-harmed and I have eating disorders. In response to my mental illness, I have been told I need to just snap out of it, that a little vitamin D will fix me right up, that I should just shut up and be happy because I don&#8217;t have real problems, that I&#8217;m a whiny emo wimp, and worse.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>If you have mental illness, you are not alone.</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><a href=\"http://letstalk.bell.ca/en/toolkit\">Let&#8217;s talk</a>.</p>\n", "post_id": 3600, "location": false, "date": "02-13-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["characters: Bellica Agate", "characters: Queen Rain-Looking", "characters: Major Damien", "Writing"], "text": "<p>And we&#8217;re back!

And I was pretty sure I wouldn&#8217;t be going on such a baking kick again until I felt I had a kitchen I could do it in &#8212; which, no, I don&#8217;t have that feeling about either my kitchen or his.</p>\n<p><strong>I guess my baking genes were antsy enough to ignore the wrong feels the kitchens gave me and just push me to do it because <em>damn,</em> it feels good to bake again.</strong></p>\n<p>So my latest project was bran muffins. Bran muffins are not only my favourite type of muffin (right beside chocolate + chocolate + chocolate + MOAR CHOCOLATE), but Nate&#8217;s favourite, too. I did it from a package.

Just another week, or three.</p>\n<p>But that&#8217;s not true for me. Something in my life always goes wrong when Mercury is retrograde. <strong>And Mercury don&#8217;t fuck around.</strong></p>\n<p>Today I had errands; no big deal, except, you know, they <em>were</em>, but whatever. Get in the car, head up the mountain. This is after spending all morning working. Get caught in traffic. Finally make it to the SFU visitor parking lot aaaaatttttt&#8230;3:38pm. I need to get a print out from the registration office and then go to the bookstore to return books that I&#8217;ve been trying to return for a month <strong>before four o&#8217;clock. </strong></p>\n<p>So naturally, Galactica dies on me.</p>\n<p><strong>Right there in the middle of the parking lot. </strong></p>\n<p>A few months ago she was doing this <em>thing</em>, I&#8217;m not really sure <em>what</em> it was, but I know it was making her stall out and then not start again for hours, if at all. We took her to the mechanic and got &#8216;er fixed, for no small amount of money (around 400 dollars).</p>\n<p>So she&#8217;s doing it again. Wouldn&#8217;t start, not even with a jump. Or ten. I had to call a tow truck, and no, I didn&#8217;t get to the bookstore to return the books. I also didn&#8217;t get to downtown to pick up a proof from the printer&#8217;s, nor to my old landlady&#8217;s house to get my mail from my last place. Or grocery shopping. Ie, the rest of my errands. None of those happened.</p>\n<p>Had to wait a long time for the tow truck to come. Apparently they had to build the truck for him first, or something. Anyway, he was a nice guy; took me to my fiance&#8217;s place, where I sit now, writing this for you. Couldn&#8217;t take me home, because Galactica needs to get parked in the parkade and the tow truck wouldn&#8217;t fit, and couldn&#8217;t take me to the mechanic because it would be pointless. They were closed and I would have had to wait outside in the rain for someone to <em>maybe </em>pick me up; more likely, I&#8217;d have to be lucky and catch the right bus &#8212; that is, if I still had enough money for transit after towing costs &#8212; and my luck with transit is&#8230;iffy? Definitely NOT something to be gambled with when Mercury is wandering around all over the cosmos like a drunken frat boy.</p>\n<p>Towing cost me all of my grocery money. So. That was nice.</p>\n<p><strong>On the plus side, my fiance&#8217;s house is full of food. So I shall eat it until I&#8217;m full.</strong></p>\n<p>It is also full of Netflix. I drowned my sorrows in <em>The Hunger Games</em>.</p>\n<p>Anyway, you didn&#8217;t come here to hear me whine. Wait, actually, I&#8217;m not sure why you came here if that&#8217;s the case. Whining is pretty much all I do.</p>\n<p>So! <em>The Jade Star of Athering</em>. Yes. That thing.</p>\n<p>Been working on it every day this month. Working hard. I set myself a deadline of finishing it by&#8230;um&#8230;tomorrow, but seeing as today&#8217;s events kind of borked the fuck out of everything, that may not happen. If I don&#8217;t finish the book tomorrow, my stretch deadline is March 8th.</p>\n<p>Ran into a couple of problems the past few days that left me frustrated enough to screw up the progress I was making, unfortunately. <strong>Nothing like writing a continuity error into the plot of a sequel.</strong> Easily fixable, luckily &#8212; well, relatively easily &#8212; and all done now; really <em>you&#8217;ll never notice</em> where I grafted in the fix. And then I had to spend a morning figuring out troop deployments, marching orders, etc. There may have been some maps involved. Maps that are now sitting on my desk, at home.</p>\n<p>Tonight&#8217;s writing and tomorrow morning&#8217;s scribblings are doing to be done sans guidance. Whatever; that&#8217;s fine. <strong>Nothing will stop me from writing this book. </strong></p>\n<p>Regardless the problems, the book has been pretty exciting the past few weeks. New things have cropped up, old storylines are being wrapped up, things I gave clues for in <em>Bellica</em> will be revealed. As well, the plot for a third book is revealing itself to me, so gods willing I&#8217;ll have the first draft of another book [in what is apparently turning into a series] started before the end of the year. (Maybe I can make it my November project.)</p>\n<p><strong>March project is revisions and story bibles!</strong> That&#8217;s a lot of work, and I&#8217;m hoping it&#8217;ll help me lay out the rest of the groundwork I need for Camp NaNoWriMo and my April novel project, the next book in the <em>Stranger Skies</em> series, currently untitled.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t yet have a release date for any of these books. I&#8217;m hoping to have a clearer picture of when that will be next month. Before the first round of revisions is done, however, I have no way to safely gauge. Suffice it to say &#8212; you will see both <em>The Jade Star of Athering</em> and <em>Stranger Skies</em> out this year. And I daresay I&#8217;ll do a better job of releasing them than I did <em>Bellica.</em> (Eeesh, what a trainwreck.)</p>\n<p>On that note, I&#8217;m off to eat the rest of my fiance&#8217;s food.

One eyes me greedily, his arm resting on my kitchen counter.</p>\n<p>A sticky bubble forms at the back of my throat.

He motions toward the digiscreen with a flick of his bony hand.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s fixed on my Debtbook profile. My picture grins into the room. There\u2019s a new status underneath my name, but I can\u2019t read it. I glance at Mr Winters and something catches the light in his hand. From in between his curled fingers protrudes the long stem of a needle.</p>\n<p>Everything slows, although I know it happens quickly.</p>\n<p>I back away and hit the screen. The black dots of text shuffle and sharpen. Mr Winters moves behind me.

To the south, though, an overtly-<a title=\"Theocracy\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theocracy\">theocratic</a> <a title=\"Christian fundamentalist\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_fundamentalist\">Christian fundamentalist</a> nation has evolved and plans to wage war against the San Franciscans. The novel explores the events before and during the ensuing struggle between the two nations, pitting\u00a0<a title=\"Utopia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia\">utopia</a> and\u00a0<a title=\"Dystopia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystopia\">dystopia</a> against each other.</p>\n<p>The story is primarily told from the points of view of 98-year-old Maya, her nominal granddaughter Madrone, and her grandson Bird. Through these and other characters, the story explores many elements from\u00a0<a title=\"Ecofeminism\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecofeminism\">ecofeminism</a> and\u00a0<a title=\"Ecotopian fiction (page does not exist)\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ecotopian_fiction&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\">ecotopian fiction</a>.</p>\n<p>The title is derived from the four\u00a0<a title=\"Classical element\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_element\">elements</a> of\u00a0<a title=\"Fire (classical element)\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_(classical_element)\">fire</a>,\u00a0<a title=\"Earth (classical element)\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_(classical_element)\">earth</a>,\u00a0<a title=\"Air (classical element)\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_(classical_element)\">air</a>, and\u00a0<a title=\"Water (classical element)\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_(classical_element)\">water</a>, plus an additional element revealed as the plot unfolds.</p>\n<p>In the novel, San Francisco is a mostly\u00a0<a title=\"Pagan\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pagan\">pagan</a> city where the streets have been torn up for gardens and streams, no one starves or is homeless, and the city&#8217;s defense council consists primarily of nine elderly women who &#8220;listen and dream&#8221;.</p></blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">While the plot, characters, and setting are all well-done and reason enough to read the book, they are not the reasons I have for wanting people to read it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">There are ideas in this book. Powerful ideas. The Ecotopia Starhawk presents may not be a perfect one, but there is the idea that things don&#8217;t have to be the way they are. That they can be totally different.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Just being able to look at the book and see a different world presented is, to me, a very good thing. Sometimes the fact of existence &#8212; that our world sucks and it&#8217;s going to take a lot of work to change it and my gods maybe we can&#8217;t even change it <em>maybe this is how things really are</em> &#8212; weighs a little too heavy. It&#8217;s nice to look at something, even if it is fictional, and think &#8220;We could be more like <em>that</em>.&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">This is why the myth of the &#8220;Great Universal Matriarchy&#8221; is so pervasive, even though it&#8217;s been debunked in academic circles for decades. I think it would be great if people stopped taking it as truth and started taking it as a myth &#8212; something to give hope, but a <em>story</em>. I can look at that myth and say &#8220;The world doesn&#8217;t have to be ultimately geared against people of my gender &#8212; or rather, people who<em> aren&#8217;t </em>cisgendered male &#8212; it could be different.&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">That is what <em>The Fifth Sacred Thing</em> gave me. A look at a world where wealth was viewed completely differently, where children were cherished, where water and food were free, where people took care of each other and the four sacred things &#8212; earth, air, fire, water. The fifth being love.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The book ultimately changed me. I want more people to read it because then, they might be changed too.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Or not. But at least they&#8217;d be thinking about those ideas. Thinking about things is half the journey.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\n", "post_id": 363, "location": false, "date": "08-13-2010", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["writing life", "stories: The Jade Star of Athering", "stories: Stranger Skies", "writing"], "text": "<p>I finished <em>The Jade Star of Athering</em> on the 6th.

I do know I&#8217;m still heavily invested in some of the characters in <em>The Jade Star</em>, and I have enough material on them to do two more books (set at the same time) thanks to plot points I set up in <em>Jade Star</em>. That, and <a href=\"http://katjevanloon.livejournal.com/6293.html\">my obsession with making two of those characters <del>bone</del> fall in luuuurrrrvvveeee</a>, could be contributing. I just want to dive back in. I had to stop myself from starting novel #3 in the <em>Bellica</em> series yesterday.</p>\n<p>Yes, stop myself. Why? Because I&#8217;ve got another book to write come April, and another to start in July. Before I can start anything, I need to <em>revise</em> current first drafts. It&#8217;s called <em>discipline.</em></p>\n<p>(Discipline doesn&#8217;t mean I can&#8217;t start plotting now, however, and that&#8217;s just what I&#8217;m going to do. A planned novel? SAY WHAT?

I&#8217;m hoping it&#8217;ll fade soon so I can get some more <em>work</em> done.</p>\n<p>There was some waffling on names for <em>Stranger Skies</em>. <a href=\"http://katjevanloon.livejournal.com/6033.html\">You can read about that at my LiveJournal</a>. I ended up deciding to keep the name <em>Stranger Skies</em>, because I frackin&#8217; love it, and ended up discovering the name of the series. While in the shower, natch; all my best ideas come when I&#8217;m cleaning myself. <del>I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s a metaphor there</del>.</p>\n<p><strong><em>The Borderlands Saga</em></strong> may not make much sense to you now. But trust me, it&#8217;s integral to the overall plot of the series.</p>\n<p>This, of course, gives me the freedom to choose a different name from <em>Wolf&#8217;s Rise</em> for the second book, and I&#8217;ve settled on a working title of <strong><em>From the Ashes</em></strong>. That book gets started in April, for Camp Nano. My goal for April is 750 words/day, which equals 22,500 for the month. Read: how to set yourself up for <em>success</em> during Camp Nano. (And if anyone wants to buy me <a href=\"https://store.lettersandlight.org/merchandise/nanowrimo-merit-badge-patches\">these merit badges</a> I would love you forever.)</p>\n<p>I also plan on participating in Camp Nano in July. Whether I write Book 3 of <em>Borderlands</em> (tentatively named <em>The Moonrunner</em>) or one of the books set after <em>Jade Star</em> remains to be seen. And, of course, normal-Nano in November.

The painting is by the late Gerry Laffra, my Opa and mom&#8217;s step-dad. Gerry did many paintings of wildlife, as well as a lovely portrait of my dog, Blue.

(Yes, you read that right.) Most of the books I&#8217;ve read have been non-fiction, which usually means that I haven&#8217;t actually finished them yet. And I have trouble picking a non-fiction book as the &#8220;best&#8221; that I&#8217;ve read, because that&#8217;s not how I measure their worth &#8212; I measure their worth in how USEFUL they are to me (also what KIND of useful &#8212; Silver RavenWolf&#8217;s books are good as doorstops or toilet paper, so are a lesser kind of useful than ones I&#8217;d actually get good knowledge out of&#8230;also SRW&#8217;s books could probably be classified as fiction, so I guess it&#8217;s sort of a moot point).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">So. I haven&#8217;t read that many fiction books in the past year. That I can remember. I actually don&#8217;t really remember much from week to week.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Which means I&#8217;m choosing a book I <em>just</em> finished, because it&#8217;s fresh in my mind and it&#8217;s by one of my favorite authors. <em>Kushiel&#8217;s Justice</em>, by Jacqueline Carey.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em>Kushiel&#8217;s Justice</em> is the fifth book in the series, and it follows the story of Imriel, foster-son of the heroine from the first 3 books. It follows the first book about him, <em>Kushiel&#8217;s Scion</em>, and is followed by the last book, <em>Kushiel&#8217;s Mercy</em>, which I have yet to read. I also read <em>Kushiel&#8217;s Scion</em> in the past 12 months (last month, actually), but it&#8217;s not as good as <em>Justice</em>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Why?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Because in <em>Justice</em> Imriel isn&#8217;t such a whiny little bitch.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The entire first book is about him trying to escape his past and his family and <em>who he is</em>. He&#8217;s like Luke Skywalker with a sword of metal instead of lazers. I&#8217;MMA CHARGGINNNNN MAH LAAAZZZHER. &#8220;Wah, my mother&#8217;s a traitor! Wah, I get off on beating people! Wah, I&#8217;m infatuated with the ONE WOMAN IN THE ENTIRE WORLD I CAN&#8217;T HAVE! Wah, I&#8217;m not as cool as my friend Eamonn! Wah, my family members are safe with being themselves!&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Ok, fine, Imriel, you were abused horribly as a child and yes, I get that and I respect that. But my gods it took you<em> a book and a half</em> to get to be a character I actually <em>liked</em>. (I&#8217;m not counting your appearance in <em>Kushiel&#8217;s Avatar</em> because that wasn&#8217;t from your point of view; also you were pretty cool for a kid who&#8217;d just been through what you&#8217;d been through.) \u00a0Less with the Whiny McBitchPants Luke Skywalker Syndrome and more with the hot beatings, yes?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Anyway. I&#8217;m not here to talk about <em>Scion</em>; I&#8217;m here to talk about <em>Justice</em>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em>Justice</em> has much the feel of the first trilogy, though it&#8217;s still not as good as the books about Phedre (cause it&#8217;s not about Phedre, natch). New lands, a quest carried out alone, danger, intrigue, even some sex! Not a lot, but some. (The second trilogy, so far, is not really PRON like the first is. Imri&#8217;s not an anguissette or a courtesan; he&#8217;s just a Shahrizai.)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I&#8217;m not going to get into details, because spoilers suck, but I did enjoy <em>Justice</em> far more than I enjoyed<em> Scion</em>. I actually stayed up all night reading <em>Justice</em>. With a flashlight. Under my covers. (It feels more important and dangerous when you do it that way.)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">If you&#8217;re a fan of J. Carey&#8217;s work&#8230;you could probably skip <em>Scion</em>. I wouldn&#8217;t, but I have a deep-seated neurosis about reading books out of order (<em>Discworld</em> drives me NUTS). If you like boys kissing, however, don&#8217;t skip <em>Scion</em>. <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-wink' title=';)'>;)</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">If you&#8217;ve never read J. Carey&#8217;s work, but you like richly painted fantasy worlds, sex, and/or BDSM, pick up <em>Kushiel&#8217;s Dart</em> and GET THEE TO A NUNNERY! I mean, reading room.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Anyway, regardless <em>Kushiel&#8217;s Scion</em> being rather lackluster, J. Carey is still one of my favorite authors. I honestly can&#8217;t wait to see the conclusion to Imriel&#8217;s story in <em>Kushiel&#8217;s Mercy</em>. (I have to finish my World of Warcraft novel first. &#8230;.yes, I&#8217;m reading a novelization about the rise of the Lich King.

I&#8217;d signed up a while ago, but hadn&#8217;t kept up with the lessons. (The course, by the way, is excellent and if you&#8217;re fat and struggle with accepting that I highly recommend it. Actually, I just highly recommend it in general &#8212; if you&#8217;re not fat, or if you&#8217;re fat and think you&#8217;re cool with it. Because I thought I was cool with it, but the course has been a bit of an eye opener. I&#8217;ll be blogging about the assignments here as I do them, by the way.)</p>\n<p>I realized I wanted to do more with my blog, and I decided that fat acceptance was something I should really start talking about.

I believed that I wasn&#8217;t allowed to be femme because femme meant feminine to me, and fat girls are constantly taught that we&#8217;re not allowed to be feminine. Because feminine is reserved for attractive women, and we&#8217;re told we&#8217;re not attractive.</p>\n<p>Fuck that. I&#8217;m tired of making apologies for what I am. <strong>What I am is femme and fat,</strong> no matter what gender I&#8217;m swinging into on any given day. I have always been femme; my years of hiding behind a butch exterior (<em>my nickname used to be Butch</em>) was because I thought I wasn&#8217;t allowed to be femme.</p>\n<p>So I defy that.

(I&#8217;m 24. It was a frackin&#8217; <em>awesome</em> day.)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">My favorite book or series ever. This is a really, really hard choice. I have so <em>many</em> books that I just love to death and will read again and again. If I have to choose just <em>one</em>, however&#8230;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em>Glenraven</em>, by Marion Zimmer Bradley and Holly Lisle.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Now. I will add, as a disclaimer, that is has been years since I read this book and I don&#8217;t recall all the details. My copy is, well, you guessed it, in a box somewhere, and I haven&#8217;t had a chance to unearth it and re-read it yet. However. I&#8217;m just going to say, in general, why I love this book so much. There are two reasons.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">One: I am a hopeless romantic. There, I said it. Can&#8217;t take it back; it&#8217;s in writing now. (I&#8217;m fairly fracked.) I am a hopeless romantic, and that is why this book appeals to me (this is also why other books high on my favorites list include <em>The Black Jewels Trilogy</em> and <em>Grayheart</em>).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Two: I am a wanderer. I am constantly looking for a place to call <em>home</em>. People say that home is where your heart is. I say your heart is where home is. There is a place out there that is home to me. I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;ve found it yet. The closest I came to feeling like I had was when I went to Guatemala.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em>Glenraven</em> is about two women, best friends, grieving over their broken lives, going on a bike ride and ending up in a magical kingdom called Glenraven. One finds true love there, a partner willing to die for her &#8212; the other, healing, and a reason to go home and to try and patch her life back together.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The idea that just by taking a bike ride one can end up in a completely different land &#8212; and I mean,<em> completely</em> different &#8212; that one can just disappear from this world&#8230;strikes a deep chord in me. And then to find true love there&#8230;that&#8217;s fucking whipped cream on the cake.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I once wrote a poem that was inspired by <em>Glenraven</em>, actually, and it can be read <a href=\"http://muertastears.wordpress.com/2008/12/26/poetry-transit-stories/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Anyway. That&#8217;s pretty much why it&#8217;s my favorite book, and that&#8217;s all I really have to say. Also, it&#8217;s my birthday, so if you want more too fucking bad. ME TIME.

He also has major abandonment issues.</p>\n<p>He&#8217;s a wolf-shepherd and he&#8217;s a rescue. Those things don&#8217;t combine very well &#8212; neither the breeding of wolf and shepherd by macho men who want a &#8220;tough guard dog&#8221;, nor the combining of said hybrid with a past that contained neglect and, quite likely, abuse. Wolff has had to work very hard with Tyee to get him to be as well-behaved as he is now.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_3682\" style=\"width: 594px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://katandwolff.com/tyee/\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-3682\" alt=\"&quot;Morning Mom!

We&#8217;ve also taught him that he&#8217;s not to howl at sirens while he&#8217;s in the apartment &#8212; trust me, that was not easy! Sirens go by here every few hours, and we&#8217;ve never had a wolf dog who wouldn&#8217;t let out a song with such invitation. But he&#8217;s very smart, and figures out what we want soon enough.</p>\n<p>Of course he still has his bad days. That&#8217;s to be expected. And we can&#8217;t fully trust him around kids &#8212; simply because we don&#8217;t know enough about what happened in his past, and he still has some behavioral issues that may be related to the mixture of wolf and shepherd more than how he was treated. (Seriously, folks, <strong>only ever breed wolf with husky</strong>. Anything else is just a really fucking bad idea.) <em><strong>This is not to say that he&#8217;s dangerous</strong></em> &#8212; he&#8217;s <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong>not</strong></span>. He just seems to have issues with younger mammals: he needs to tell them off. Combine that with a kid who doesn&#8217;t know how to treat dogs with respect, and we&#8217;ve got a recipe for the city putting down our ~*~dangerous~*~ wolf-dog.

It takes time and effort to build up that sort of trust and rapport</strong>, and we had a place we could leave him &#8212; a boarder who had several other dogs and a lot of room for Tyee to run and play and frolic.</p>\n<p>The plan was, we thought, to leave Tyee with this secondary pack when mom and I went down to Spring Mysteries Fest. He loves his pack so much that he barely notices us leaving: <em>bye, Mom! Gonna go play!</em> He bounds off, excited to spend time with his friends again.</p>\n<p>Except that&#8217;s not happening. Tyee&#8217;s not going to his boarder &#8212; not this time, not, apparently, ever again. <strong>He was dumped.</strong></p>\n<p>Reasoning? No clue. Something about Tyee &#8220;not being safe&#8221; anymore.\u00a0 The boarder states we&#8217;ve been told all the details, but there&#8217;s obviously something missing &#8212; because the details don&#8217;t add up to our dog being classified as <em>dangerous.</em></p>\n<p>And here, you see, are the dangers of having a wolf-dog in your life. They are amazing and they will take up a massive portion of your heart, until your heart must grow to contain all the love you feel for such a wondrous creature who chooses to let you share your life with him. They are messengers of the Goddess Silva, lady of the True Woods, Queen of the Deep Furs, here to teach us back to our true selves. <strong>If ever you get to spend any part of your life with a wolf-dog, consider yourself extremely lucky.</strong></p>\n<p>But if you are to share your life with a wolf dog, you must be prepared to give up a large portion of your time. They are high-maintenance. They require the attention of a pack-mate &#8212; not an <em>owner.</em> <strong>You never own a wolf-dog; do not ever convince yourself otherwise.</strong> They need to have their place in the pack, and have it secure. And if you need to travel, you need to find someone to take care of them who is also like a pack-mate &#8212; abandonment issues or not (though, obviously, this is doubly important in cases like Tyee&#8217;s).</p>\n<p>And if you lose that person right before you have to travel on a trip that was planned for months? Then you lose your ability to travel.</p>\n<p>So, mom will not be coming along to Spring Mysteries Fest this year. She will be staying home with Tyee. And we will be spending the next months trying to find someone new to take care of him during our absences &#8212; someone who <em>won&#8217;t</em> dump him with no warning.</p>\n<p>-Kat</p>\n", "post_id": 3680, "location": false, "date": "03-26-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Eragon", "OH FUCK MY EYES", "gywo", "Christopher Paolini"], "text": "<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>A book or series you hate</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Oh man. This one is almost too easy. (I say &#8216;almost&#8217; because there is a book/series that I actually hate more than the one I&#8217;m writing about now&#8230;but as I haven&#8217;t actually been able to bring myself to read the whole thing, and as there&#8217;s a lot of virulent hate for it<em> already</em>, I figured I&#8217;d go with the lesser-hated series.)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em>Eragon</em>. Or the Inheritance saga, whatever the fuck. Has to be the worst writing I&#8217;ve ever read in my life. After I finished the first chapter I felt like someone had hit my head with a sledgehammer, repeatedly. Paolini was in high school when he finished the book, and you know what?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">It shows.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I&#8217;m not being ageist &#8212; lots of teens have tremendous writing talent. But it is the very, very rare\u00a0occasion\u00a0that that writing talent has been honed for years, making said teen capable of <em>crafting</em> an original, comprehensive, compelling story. It is time and experience and encouragement (positive AND negative) that builds writing talent, and few teens have had that. I certainly didn&#8217;t. I started my novel when I was 12 and I finished it when I was 22. It took epic amounts of re-writing to make the beginning as good as the end.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">In this book, there were obviously no rewrites. Paolini probably finished it, showed it to his parents (who were no doubt THRILLLLLLED with it and showered it with praise, little dollar signs in their eyes), and then they got it published. I may or may not be insinuating that there were favors performed for publishing execs. Publishing execs who had never seen <em>Star Wars</em>, read <em>Lord of the Rings</em>, heard of RA Salvatore, or even just fucking knew the genre. At<em> all</em>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em>Eragon</em> was a rip off of, well, where do I begin? It would be shorter to list what <em>wasn&#8217;t</em> ripped off.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Um.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Let me think.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">&#8230;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Yeah, I got nothing.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">There were dragons! They imprint on their riders upon hatching! *cough*Pern*cough* There was a totally original setting that in no way reminded one of a combo of Middle Earth and the worlds of R.A. Salvatore&#8217;s Forgotten Realms series. IN NO WAY. I cannot STRESS that enough. It was COMPLETELY ORIGINAL.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The family of origin stuff with the main character was totally normal. There was no orphaning. At all.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">And there totally wasn&#8217;t a sometimes-creepy Luke-Obi-wan relationship between Eragon and his mentor, Whatshisfuck.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">But my complaints do not rest solely on Paolini&#8217;s ability to imagine things and create a world unmistakably his own. My complaints rest on the dense, unreadable prose.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Allow me to review the book, emulating Paolini&#8217;s writing style.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">So there was this guy Eragon who like found an egg or some shit and then this dragon hatched out of it and he kept it a secret while he tried to name it and there was this funny bit where he realized it was a girl dragon and then he named her Saphira and then he went to talk to this creepy old dude in his village about dragons or something and the dude obviously knew a lot but was being cagey for some reason I have no idea what the fuck and then there was training to ride Saphira (unf unf unf) and then Eragon&#8217;s family was killed, or something, by VERY! POWERFUL! BEINGS! who were out to get him and the dragon so he and his creepy old dude mentor have to run away or something and they do but they can&#8217;t ride Saphira because she&#8217;s a baby dragon or something and they get into battles and adventure and stuff and at some point Saphira gets totally pissed off at Eragon but then she totally gets over it, I guess, and they continue on, and then I&#8217;m not sure what else happens because I sort of blacked out and when I awoke I was in a soft room, wearing a jacket that let me hug myself, and when they finally let me out for good behavior there was still blood under my nails.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">*takes a deep breath*</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">AND THEN AND THEN AND THEN AND THEN AND THEN</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">and <em>then</em> I went to see the movie, to see if I could understand the plot better.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The movie was worse, because they took a great actress like Rachel Weisz and then fucked up on the voice syncing with Saphira&#8217;s CG image so all her lines sounded wooden because they didn&#8217;t match the dragon at ALL and man, if it had been me I would have, well, I never would have been involved in the first place BUT IF I HAD and that had happened I would have called Wayne Brady and asked him to choke Christopher Paolini.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I still don&#8217;t remember the plot. I remember John Malkovich had a sword and was dark and angsty.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I mean, for fuck&#8217;s sake, the book&#8217;s only claim to flame I MEAN FAME, really, I mean, because it has NO LITERARY MERIT AT ALL, is that Chris P. wrote it when he was in high school. OH OH OH MY GODS A YOUNG AUTHOR HOW AMAZING THAT&#8217;S SO FUCKING COOL WHEEEEEEEEEEE.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I had an autographed copy of the book because he was at the Maui Writer&#8217;s Conference the year after I attended [as a young novelist], and my mom went and got me a copy because, well, <em>Eragon</em> was the next hot thing.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I swear upon a stack of Kama Sutras that my opinion of the book was in no way influenced by the fact that I was incredibly bitter that he got famous before I did. (Really, I went into it unbiased and objective, and came out of it crying, running to my roommate&#8217;s room and saying &#8220;The book touched me in a bad place!&#8221;)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">My roommate finished the book for me and explained the plot, agreeing that it was horribly written. When the second one came out he got it and &#8212; behold! There was a little paragraph at the beginning, summarizing the events in the first book. THE LITTLE SUMMARY PARAGRAPH WAS A BETTER TELLING OF THAT STORY. I SHIT YOU NOT.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Because that was the problem &#8212; he took what would have been a good first two chapters and draaaaaaaaaaaaaagggggggeeeeeeeeeedddddddddddd iiiiiiiiiittttttttttttt ooooooooooouuuuuuuuuuuuttttttttttttttttttt until his readers cried tears of blood and begged him to stop.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">In conclusion, I think his hands should be chopped off to prevent him from inflicting more of his terrible, terrible writing upon the world. (Restraining order in three, two, one&#8230;.)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Though I do think it&#8217;s unfortunate; were it not for his horrible plague of bad books, unleashed upon the world like tainted grain from Andorhal (yes, I&#8217;m a nerd), I <a href=\"http://blogs.davenportlibrary.com/teens/wp-content/Christopher_Paolini_Montana.jpg\">would actually think him rather attractive</a>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Sigh. Another piece of eye candy bites the dust. &#8216;Sokay. He&#8217;s too old for me anyway.

Today, I took them again &#8212; a complete 24 hours later. On time, correctly. For the past three and a half months, I&#8217;ve been functioning pretty okay without my meds, and I stopped taking them because I was throwing up after swallowing the pill (that hasn&#8217;t happened again, so I may have just had a mild flu, or something). So I didn&#8217;t really see the need to start up again. I was doing okay.</p>\n<p>That obviously changed. Had a mental breakdown this week. Was on the verge of another, until I took my Zoloft. Then I was a few feet <em>back</em> from the verge, but it took until this morning to <em>really</em> kick in.</p>\n<p>The Zoloft didn&#8217;t fix the problem, but what it did do was calm the anxiety that was clouding my thoughts and give me a chance to breathe. And then I was able to see the source of the problem &#8212; which, again, not a fix, but I&#8217;m now very far back from the edge of any more breakdowns, which is better than I was doing a few days ago.</p>\n<p>Still not entirely stable.

I forgot, of course, that when you get a bunch of poison expelled from you that little bubbles remain, and can erupt. I forgot that a large, or perhaps small and just very <em>strong,</em> part of my brain is <em>dedicated</em> to making sure I don&#8217;t heal: it&#8217;s the part of my brain that lies to me, that tries to sever what little support I have, that convinces me I&#8217;ll always be broken and worthless.</p>\n<p>Medication, at this point, really helps in shutting that part of my brain up.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not going to get into specifics about what the mental breakdown was surrounding. Suffice it to say my brain <em>lied,\u00a0</em>and tried to cut me off from my support system, but I persevered and did not give in. With a bit of help from Zoloft, of course.</p>\n<p>And today I made the decision to blog about it. To talk about my mental illness publicly, while I&#8217;m still not wholly stable. I&#8217;ve done this before, but not really like this. I&#8217;ve never blogged while I was this unstable. Or if I have, I haven&#8217;t been able to talk about that instability with any sort of <em>optimism.</em></p>\n<p>Today, I can do that.

I like the whooshing sound they make as they fly by.</p></blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:right;\">-<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Adams\">Douglas Adams</a></p>\n<p>I had several deadlines this month, and I think I missed half of them. I&#8217;m not entirely sure, as I never wrote them down in my own calendar, but I did announce them to other people. That was probably silly.</p>\n<p>Anyway, if you&#8217;re one of the people who got an announcement from me about certain release dates of certain ebooks (mine and Kaimana Wolff&#8217;s) for certain formats/sites&#8230;I&#8217;m still formatting. Probably won&#8217;t be done till the end of the month.</p>\n<p>I used to be good at deadlines. Good under pressure; I could churn out awesome essays a day before they were due. Once I hit college, though, overwhelm began to catch up with me. Also heart problems. (While I attended MCC, I had no fewer than 5 incidents that felt like textbook heart attacks; however, the doctors said I was full of it and probably lying, though they did end up doing a test which &#8212; they said &#8212; showed I had not ever had any heart attacks. Which I think may be BS, but I&#8217;m not a doctor so, you know. Anyway each time it happened I was pretty sure I was dying. Said incidents haven&#8217;t happened in several years now; thank gods for small miracles?) My brain began dropping pertinent info. I&#8217;m sure the multiple concussions haven&#8217;t helped that.</p>\n<p>Deadlines are now those things that I try very hard to ignore because they induce a massive amount of stress in me. Every once in a while I&#8217;ll think <em>Oh, what I need is a good deadline, make me work harder/faster/better/stronger!</em> and then I just listen to Daft Punk on repeat and get nothing done until the deadline has passed. Then I feel guilty for not getting the thing done before deadline, and avoid it some more, until finally in a desperate push I get it all done in three days on a high of coffee, chocolate, and tears before dropping half dead into a week-long coma.</p>\n<p>I guess what I&#8217;m really trying to say here is if I ever tell you I&#8217;ve given myself a deadline, don&#8217;t expect anything from me by that day because it&#8217;s highly unlikely I&#8217;ll get anything done before the deadline. This applies to work stuff <em>and</em> personal stuff. Ogre knows very well by now that if I say I&#8217;ll be at his place by 8, I really mean 10 or perhaps 11.</p>\n<p>This may also apply to release dates of future books, though I do try to get those out as on time as I can. Just, you know, for the record. If I ever release a book late and try to blame it on Amazon taking 12 hours to upload to the store, or whatever, just know that&#8217;s a load of bollocks and me trying to hide my shame and guilt behind a giant corporation (because, you know, the 12 hour delay is well known &#8212; so it&#8217;s just a case of me forgetting to upload until release day, or maybe not even having it completely ready). I am <em>terrible</em> with deadlines.</p>\n<p>(This is also why <em>Bellica</em> chapters do not always get uploaded to <a href=\"http://www.wattpad.com/story/3073641-bellica-heavens\">Wattpad</a> on time. <a href=\"http://bellica.katjewrites.com/\">On the site</a>, I can schedule posts, but on Wattpad I actually need to be near a computer to do it &#8212; the mobile app strips out italics, as does the mobile version of the site, so doing it via iPad or phone doesn&#8217;t work &#8212; so often my &#8216;MWF mornings&#8217; posts will be more like &#8216;TWSS or whenever, sheesh, and never in the morning, or maybe at 3am, I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m not even sure where I am right now&#8217; posts.)</p>\n<p>Though, to be perfectly honest, I might have made these <em>particular</em> deadlines had my laptop not died on me last month. I can&#8217;t do the work for them on the iPad (which miraculously fixed itself, go fig), so weekends are no longer a viable work time for me.</p>\n<p>&#8230;nope, just making excuses.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m simply terrible at deadlines.</p>\n<p>And, you know, now that I&#8217;ve admitted it publicly I feel a lot better.</p>\n<p>-Kat, who was supposed to finish this post and go to bed over an hour ago</p>\n", "post_id": 3721, "location": false, "date": "04-15-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["life", "technology"], "text": "<p>I&#8217;m just going to start off by saying that I <em>hate</em> that the word <em>technology</em> has become short-hand for &#8220;computer-and-internet-related tech&#8221; <em>specifically.</em> The thing is, <em>technology</em> actually refers to <em>all the things we humans use to get along in the world</em>. Clothes on your back? Technology. Fire to cook your food? Technology. Housing? Technology.</p>\n<p>But that&#8217;s all rather long to put into a title for a blog post. So I succumb, a tiny bit, to <em>popular</em> usage (which, by the way, does not always mean <em>correct</em> usage &#8212; hence why dictionaries are not the <em>best</em> source for a word&#8217;s <em>actual</em> meaning).</p>\n<p>Rabid lexophilia aside &#8212; <strong>I recently spent over 24 hours with no internet.</strong></p>\n<p>This was because our money issues have come to the point where we have to juggle bills according to priority, and we had to leave the internet bill for a long time.</p>\n<p>We managed to get the internet turned back on (otherwise how would I be posting this), but for a good portion of 2 days &#8212; during most of which I was actually awake and able to brain &#8212; I had no internet access whatsoever.</p>\n<p>And I felt like I&#8217;d lost a limb. Or rather, <strong>I felt as I did when I realized that my back injury had effectively cut off a good portion of my life. (Goodbye, racquet-ball and horseback riding.)</strong></p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not trying to say that the internet has become <em>essential</em> in my life &#8212; except it <em>has,</em> in many ways, because I&#8217;m trying to make my living as a writer. And in this future of indie publishing, this future of leaving the Big Six behind, <strong>trying to build up your career as an author without any sort of online presence is&#8230;well, <em>exceptionally</em> difficult.</strong> I think, perhaps, more so if you&#8217;re on the younger side of 40 &#8212; you haven&#8217;t had as much time to build up a network of contacts, nor as much practice (and if you&#8217;re like me, or many other writers, you <em>have</em> to practice at networking because talking to people comes as naturally as rolling around in jello and yodeling). My mom has much more success in local community-based networking than I do, because she&#8217;s had more time to perfect her social skills, and more time to make more friends.</p>\n<p>Still, not as essential as, say, food, or water, or clothes or shelter or clean air to breathe. That whole <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs\">Maslow&#8217;s Hierarchy thing</a>. (Which, yes, <em>the internet</em> as itself is not actually <em>on</em> &#8212; but I&#8217;d say it could be<em> related to</em> or <em>included with</em> the top three or even four levels of the pyramid.)</p>\n<p>But I find myself wondering how people survived without the internet &#8212; how they survive <em>today</em> without it, for I&#8217;m well aware that only a minority of humanity actually has internet &#8212; let alone computing! &#8212; access. I honestly cannot remember a time when I did not use the internet. I know such a time exists, because I remember when we first got AOL dial-up and were so excited about it. I just can&#8217;t remember what that time was <em>like.</em> (Insert caveat here about how most of my childhood memories have been suppressed for unrelated reasons.)</p>\n<p><strong>I spent my adolescence on the internet; I grew up here. It has become a part of me.</strong> I was on Facebook when it first started. I began blogging on Blogdrive as Jagged. I have been in cyberspace so long it&#8217;s become one of my main places to visit. In fact, I spend so much time here it may as well be a second home.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/122174-Worlds-First-Cyborg-Speaks-Out\">I watched a video recently about\u00a0Neil Harbisson</a> &#8212; a man who was born with achromatopsia (meaning he cannot see any colours). Through the help of a device called the eyeborg, Neil can now <em>hear</em> colours. He&#8217;s considered the first officially recognized cyborg because his passport photo includes his eyeborg.</p>\n<p>He said something that stuck with me.</p>\n<blockquote><p>One day I started hearing colors in my dreams. Then I understood what being a cyborg meant. It&#8217;s not the union between the eyeborg and my head, what converts me into a cyborg, but the union between the software and my brain. My body and the technology have united. It&#8217;s very, very human to modify one&#8217;s body with human creations.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It made me wonder if those of us who have grown up with computers and the internet as part of our daily lives have not, in some way, already become cyborgs. Or at least the midpoint between non-cyborg and cyborg; that stepping stone between non-reliant on computing technology and physically integrated with it.</p>\n<p>I have dreams about the internet. Tetris plays across my eyelids when I shut them.</p>\n<p>When I lose the internet for a few days, I wander around in a haze for hours before finally texting my fiance at 4 am to say &#8220;What on earth do people without the internet DO?&#8221;.</p>\n<p>(He texted back &#8220;You could play Civ 5, but you&#8217;re so obsessed with achievements I doubt it&#8217;d be fun to play offline.&#8221; But not until the internet was back on.)</p>\n<p>I couldn&#8217;t even <em>work.</em> I managed to get 1500 words written on <em>Winterborn,</em> but then had to quit again. I actually do a fair amount of research for my books online, and sometimes I just can&#8217;t continue a scene until I&#8217;ve got a piece of research down. Publishing work? Forget it. I don&#8217;t have a master document on my computer of dimensions and such for formatting. I look that stuff up as a I need to &#8212; especially as it often <em>changes.</em></p>\n<p>After writing and watching the rest of the episodes of <em>Castle</em> I have lying around (I&#8217;m all caught up now; yay) I spun around in my chair and looked at the ceiling of my office. Then I went to bed, because what <em>else</em> was I going to do?</p>\n<p>When I woke up, the internet was back on. Good thing, too, because I probably would have gone <em>mad</em> had it been off any longer.</p>\n<p>Of course, now that it&#8217;s back on all the things I could have done when it was off occur to me. Read. Clean my kitchen. Work on cleaning my bedroom. Organize my things for moving in a few months.</p>\n<p>But it seems those things are much easier to accomplish when I can <em>choose</em> to walk away from the internet. I do an hour of cleaning, and then allow myself to read blogs or write blog posts or wander around on social media or watch an episode of <em>My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic</em> on Netflix before I start working again. With the internet gone not of my own choice, it&#8217;s much harder to do anything else &#8212; not just because of the lack of usual reward, but because with the internet cut off I don&#8217;t feel 100% myself. I have no balance and can&#8217;t find my way.</p>\n<p>This is the future that I never saw coming. <strong>I wonder what other future I&#8217;ll become in 5, 10, 25 years?</strong></p>\n<p>-Kat</p>\n", "post_id": 3723, "location": false, "date": "04-18-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["oh gods that's nasty", "the zombie bugs saga", "Crippling Self-Doubt"], "text": "<p>Those of you who have been around for a while probably remember my fight with the zombie bugs here in the apartment.

This is why certain fandoms have long-standing beefs with each other, too (because apparently there can only ever be one science-fiction thing ever).</p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s silly and counterproductive. You can love both <em>Star Trek</em> and <em>Star Wars</em> and at the same time think that <em>Star Trek</em> is actually a better creation. You can love Whedonverse stuff while still acknowledging that most of it is nowhere near as feminist as people claim and that he&#8217;s not the greatest writer that ever lived.

You just need to remember to take a step back, breathe, and remind yourself that people can hate the things you love. And if you really think they&#8217;ve got a certain aspect of a book wrong, you can tell them so. You can engage in arguments about it because that is also a part of literary culture, that is also a part of literary criticism.</p>\n<p>But telling them to shut up and go away because they&#8217;re stupid and they don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re talking about and they&#8217;re just jealous! OMG!!!!1111oneoneeleven? That&#8217;s not. That&#8217;s just screaming at the darkness, trying desperately to prove you exist. We get it. You exist. You are also stuck in a black-and-white, 1-star-and-5-star-review dichotomy. Good job.</p>\n<p><strong>When it comes to literary criticism, stop with the &#8220;If you don&#8217;t like it, don&#8217;t read it!&#8221; argument. It&#8217;s not even an argument. It&#8217;s the equivalent of a kindergartener screaming to the teacher that another kid pushed him.</strong></p>\n<p>There is no rule anywhere that says we must all be nice to authors. There is no rule anywhere that says we can&#8217;t criticize fiction, or that it must always be constructive. Sure, it&#8217;s <em>nicer</em> to do constructive criticism, but there&#8217;s no rule that says literary criticism must be <em>nice.</em> There is no rule anywhere dictating how authors should respond to said criticism or that they should at all. There&#8217;s no rule saying authors must read all criticism of their work (in fact, it&#8217;s probably better for their mental health if they don&#8217;t, but again &#8212; there&#8217;s no rule saying they shouldn&#8217;t, either).</p>\n<p><strong>The only thing that comes close to being a rule about literary criticism is that if a book has been published, it&#8217;s open to criticism. If fanfic has been published, it&#8217;s open to criticism. </strong><strong>And that is not so much a rule as just a <em>fact.</em> <em>of. life.</em></strong></p>\n<p>Embrace the shades of grey.** Nothing in life is black and white.</p>\n<p>Except zebras. And dalmatians.</p>\n<p>Ok some things are black and white. My point still stands.</p>\n<p>-Kat</p>\n<p>*I disagree vehemently with the idea that things like Protectors of the Plot Continuum or other criticisms of Mary Sues in fic exist as ways to &#8220;silence&#8221; women authors. If a fanfic writer fucks up the plot of a book and makes all the characters go OOC because s/he wants to bone the main character or out-power the main character or <em>both</em> and s/he does it <em>terribly</em>, criticism of that story is well and fair. Hell, criticism is well and fair no matter if the story is done terribly or excellently and you don&#8217;t even care that there&#8217;s a Mary Sue cause it&#8217;s such an awesome story. <strong>If criticism is silencing, then all English departments should be shut down, because they&#8217;re silencing authors too.</strong></p>\n<p>**Yes, I do find it <em>hilarious</em> that a lot of people who are caught up in this black-and-white thinking are also major fans of <em>Fifty Shades of Grey</em>.

I registered weeks ago, changing my address online, in preparation for this day. I was even going to advance vote last week, but I didn&#8217;t get a chance to make it to the polling station before I headed away from my town for the weekend. So I decided to do it on the day itself. I mean, the polling stations are open for 12 hours, and voting takes ten minutes.</p>\n<p>Voting is the easiest thing to do in Canada. When I took Nate on Saturday to advance vote, he was in and out in under 2 minutes. I was done in 8, and only because I stood and deliberated over candidates.

I certainly could have used one yesterday.</p></div>\n<p><strong>They must have a lot of leftover stickers after each election.</strong></p>\n<p>Voter turnout was 48%. BC elected a Liberal majority.</p>\n<p>For those of you who don&#8217;t know much about Canadian parties, the BC Liberals are actually way more conservative than the federal liberal party. Voting Liberal in BC is basically the same as voting Conservative.</p>\n<p>When I turned 18, I was excited about voting. I ran voter registration drives, I worked hard to get people to the polls, I constantly reminded friends to vote. To get out and participate in democracy.</p>\n<p>Often, after election day friends would say they &#8220;forgot&#8221; to vote if I asked them if they&#8217;d made it to the polling station. They&#8217;d spent the day on the beach instead. Or whatever.</p>\n<p>Voting wasn&#8217;t easy in the States during the 2004 election. I spent over 2 hours at the polling station, waiting for them to say yes, I could actually vote, yes, this was the right station for me. They spent a long time on hold with the authorities, whoever they are. This wasn&#8217;t uncommon. There were a lot of problems for those of us who registered Democrat.</p>\n<p>When I moved back to Canada I was pleasantly surprised with how easy voting was. <strong>&#8220;Wow,&#8221; I thought. &#8220;This is great. I bet Canadians are far more invested in democracy. Voting here is so easy.&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p>They&#8217;re not.</p>\n<p>I was always a person who took joy in the political process. Things suck and many politicians are liars and often it&#8217;s hard to feel like you&#8217;re making any real difference. Regardless, I took joy in participating in democracy. In voting, in being an activist, in speaking out, in dissent. In making my voice heard.</p>\n<p>I felt like this since 1993, when mom and dad took me to Ottawa to cheer Kim Campbell, their friend from law school and my god-mother, on as she ran for Prime Minister. I still have my pink &#8220;Kim&#8221; baseball cap somewhere. I felt like this when I accepted my award from the ACLU for being an activist in high school. I felt like this when I marched in peace demonstrations, when I spoke out, spoke up about what mattered to me. I felt like this every time I did anything that was participation in a democratic society.</p>\n<p>Key word: <strong>felt.</strong></p>\n<p>Yesterday as I walked out of the polling booth I didn&#8217;t feel suffused by the same lighthearted joy that usually took me over after I voted, or after the results of an election went the way I hoped. I felt despondency and despair; I felt hollow. The joy was gone. All I felt was that I&#8217;d done my democratic duty, and I could go home and sleep now &#8212; because who cared? What did it matter anyway?</p>\n<p><strong>I was a rarity to feel joy in democracy. I knew that. And I think knowing that killed my joy.</strong></p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t even need to check the results as they came in, or voter turnout, to feel this way. When I did finally check them, they didn&#8217;t help, save a small fist-pump at seeing that the Powell River riding finally went NDP. The results only cemented the despair, the despondency. So did the inevitable arguments about &#8220;vote splitting&#8221;. <strong>Not only did I already feel shitty about something that used to bring me joy, but now I got to listen to people who are supposedly on the same ideological, political page as me, call me a waste of space and everything that&#8217;s wrong with the world because I dared to vote with my conscience, with my heart, with my principles.</strong> Because I stood there in the polling station, not wanting to select either of the two options I&#8217;d settled on: one would be me voting against my heart, and the other would subject me to arguments with my fianc\u00e9 and other people I care about as they tell me I made the wrong choice.</p>\n<p>Because I voted Green.</p>\n<p>When in my riding it wouldn&#8217;t have made a difference anyway. If all the people who voted Green in the Coquitlam-Burke Mountain riding had voted NDP instead, the Liberals would still have taken the riding. With over 1400 votes!</p>\n<p><strong>I understand where the argument comes from.</strong> NDP and Green parties <em>are</em> really similar. I have voted NDP before &#8212; generally in ridings where the race is more neck in neck between NDP and the more conservative party. I will vote NDP again if I live in a riding where, again, the race is neck in neck. In Nate&#8217;s riding the difference was a few hundred votes; if I&#8217;d been living there I would have voted NDP.</p>\n<p>And I am of the opinion that in those few ridings where the race is so tight, maybe for a few years the Green Party shouldn&#8217;t run candidates there. Solidify the party via other ridings; gain strength that way. Work <em>with</em> the NDP for now. There are not many ridings where things are so tight. It wouldn&#8217;t be a massive sacrifice, and in the long run it may strengthen the party more. Hell, it might even lead to an NDP majority and a Green minority, which would be fucking awesome.</p>\n<p>But I am tired of hearing from people who voted NDP that it is <em><strong>all my fault</strong></em> that the Liberals won a majority. Because I voted Green in a riding where it wouldn&#8217;t have made a lick of difference. I am tired of hearing about the &#8220;problem of vote splitting&#8221; and I&#8217;m tired of seeing it being laid at the feet of the voters.</p>\n<p><strong>I voted with my conscience. That is my <em>right</em> as a citizen of a democratic society.</strong></p>\n<p>If you want to get angry about this election, if you want to get angry about the majority that was elected, go ahead. But don&#8217;t focus your anger at the people who feel the same, who didn&#8217;t want a Liberal majority any more than you did. <strong>Why not get angry about the low voter turnout?</strong> Over half the province didn&#8217;t vote yesterday or during advance voting. <strong>Over HALF the eligible voter population.</strong> Don&#8217;t you think some of the responsibility rests at their feet?</p>\n<p><strong>Or how about the people who voted but didn&#8217;t bother to educate themselves before casting their ballots?</strong> Don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s a straw man. They exist. I&#8217;ve <em>met</em> them. (And tried to educate them, obviously &#8212; but if I&#8217;ve met a few, there are surely more out there.) People who think the BC Liberals are the same as the Federal Liberals (they&#8217;re not). People who think the Liberals are still the Official Opposition to the Conservative majority (they&#8217;re not; the NDP is now).</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s ridiculously common that people either refuse to educate themselves about different platforms before they go and cast their ballots (&#8220;I&#8217;ll select Liberal, because I&#8217;m assuming the Liberals up here are the same as US Liberals!&#8221;) or that educating themselves is so daunting they refuse to vote in the <em>first</em> place.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t even get me started on &#8220;But none of the candidates are aligned with my values!&#8221; <strong>If that&#8217;s the case, you still have an option that&#8217;s participatory: you show up at the polling station and you <em>refuse your ballot</em>.</strong> When they hand it to you,<em> you hand it right back</em>. You say you&#8217;re refusing your ballot because none of the candidates are worth voting for, or whatever. All you have to say is you&#8217;re refusing your ballot.</p>\n<p>That is what you do if you feel that you can&#8217;t vote for anyone in your riding. <strong>Do you know why you do this? Because they <em>have</em> to record refused ballots separately from all other ballots.</strong> If you spoil your ballot as an act of protest, it just gets lumped in with all the other spoiled ballots, intentional or otherwise. Refused ballots are counted separately.</p>\n<p>And if more people actually took the time to register to vote and then go refuse their ballot instead of avoiding the polling stations or spoiling their ballots in protest, then the PTB might actually, I don&#8217;t know, sit up and take notice that the populace isn&#8217;t happy.</p>\n<p>You know what doesn&#8217;t tell them that? Low voter turnout. <strong>Low voter turnout tells them that people are happy with the current power structures, with the current policies.</strong> And things continue the way they&#8217;re going.</p>\n<p>Instead, people refuse to participate in democracy. I don&#8217;t mean just getting out and voting, though that is the <em>very least</em> you can do. I mean <em>educating</em> yourself before you vote. If you&#8217;re reading this I assume you have the internet. It&#8217;s a good starting place to learn about the different parties, the platforms, the issues. It&#8217;s also a good place to learn about effective protest of voting, as I outlined in the paragraphs above.</p>\n<p>If you already are politically minded and you know about the issues and the platforms&#8230;you can participate by educating other people. By dissenting, speaking out against the government when they do things you disagree with. These are things you can do as a citizen of a democratic country.</p>\n<p>Our forebears fought hard to be allowed to have a voice in government. They fought against dictatorships, they fought against sexism, they fought against racism.</p>\n<p>Now, just a few short decades after aboriginal people in Canada are allowed to vote (yeah, try and figure <em>that</em> one out &#8212; their country in the <em>first</em> place, but they weren&#8217;t allowed to have any say in it for the longest time. Hooray for colonialism!), we have some of the lowest voter turnouts in history. We have an apathetic populace that would rather spit on the memory of people who fought and died for our right to cast our ballots, to make our voices heard, than get out of the house or work and get to the polling station to spend three minutes checking a box on a piece of paper and putting it in a box full of other votes.</p>\n<p>No wonder I no longer feel any joy in the political process.<strong> The apathy of my fellow countryfolk is an anchor chained to my neck, dragging me down and drowning me.</strong></p>\n<p>So, my fellow British Columbians, how about a toast? I raise my glass, full of a bitter Socratic draught.</p>\n<p><em>Here&#8217;s to democracy.<br />\n</em></p>\n", "post_id": 3744, "location": false, "date": "05-16-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["philosophical science fiction", "Star Trek: Into Darkness", "Star Trek"], "text": "<p>I&#8217;m not being <em>literal</em> with that observation. There was plenty of lens flare.</p>\n<p>Overall I found the latest NewTrek film disappointing. For various reasons. What follows is an elaboration and refinement of my original, raw review, posted to Google+ soon after seeing the film.</p>\n<p><strong>MAJOR SPOILERS ahead for <i>Star Trek: Into Darkness</i>. I&#8217;ll put them after the &#8220;Read more&#8221; jump so you can easily avoid them.<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>Nate took me to see <i>Star Trek: Into Darkness</i> Monday night. (We also saw<em> Iron Man 3</em>. It was a Double Feature Date Night; something that&#8217;s always a lot of fun because we can only afford it something like once a year.)</p>\n<h3><strong><em>Star Trek</em> and Philosophy</strong></h3>\n<p>I am a huge <em>Star Trek</em> fan. I&#8217;ve not seen <em>every</em> episode of every series or every movie, but I grew up on <i>The Next Generation </i>as and when I was allowed or able to watch TV. I have yet to finish my complete viewing of <em>TNG.</em> I&#8217;ve seen almost all of <i>Voyager</i> (my favourite series, so far; there were a <em>few</em> episodes I had to skip because they were awful). <em>DS9</em> and <em>TOS</em> are still on my to-watch list in their entirety, but I&#8217;ve seen enough episodes (or movies) of either to consider myself a fan of both. <em>Enterprise</em> I will likely never watch unless I get really, really bored. Or drunk.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m also a fan of philosophical science-fiction in general. Growing up on <em>Star Trek</em> likely awakened that love in me. Not <em>every</em> episode nor every movie succeeds in really tackling the hard questions, but I would definitely say <em>Star Trek</em> <strong>as a whole</strong> is philosophical. I don&#8217;t think that every episode or every movie should strive to tackle those questions &#8212; philosophy needs to be balanced with mindless entertainment, I think, especially for those of us who like to marathon episodes. Furthermore, the first goal of a movie will generally be <em>bums in seats.</em> Philosophical sci-fi is a gamble in that respect. It could work really well, or it could bomb. What <em>does</em> consistently work well is the promise of a lot of action and high-stakes, tension-filled scenes.</p>\n<p>Often this is why filmmakers will do those sorts of blockbuster hits in great numbers &#8212; to make enough money to fund artsier, more philosophical, and less commercially viable projects. Banking on a sure thing in order to make sure the other thing that may or may not make a lot of money actually gets to production stage.</p>\n<p>(Writers often do this too, for what it&#8217;s worth. I&#8217;m not knocking the practice at all. It works.)</p>\n<p>To that end, it&#8217;s a bit easier to get philosophy into long-running TV shows. So long as the action and tension are still tight, the characters well developed, the world engaging, and the plot convincing and well-moving, you can afford to tackle philosophical issues in an episodic plot structure.</p>\n<p>Of course, too much philosophy &#8212; too many questions about life and the nature of humanity and the morality of law and not enough explosions, kidnapping, or other high-tension situations &#8212; and you run the risk of being canceled. (See: <i>Caprica</i>.)</p>\n<p>My point is, while I think philosophy is important to the sci-fi medium (it&#8217;s not <em>really</em> sci-fi if you&#8217;re not asking questions about the nature of humanity), I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s going to be a <i>lot</i> of philosophy in the new <em>Star Trek</em> films and that&#8217;s okay with me. There&#8217;s plenty to be had in the extant films and series, and newly-made fans who go back to watch those things will either love said philosophy, or they won&#8217;t.</p>\n<p>I do think the two new <em>Star Trek</em> films <i>did</i> have some philosophy in them. Not a lot, but enough to satisfy me, at least. <em>Into Darkness</em> definitely brought up questions of becoming the very evil we fear when we try to <i>stop</i> that evil, which I think is always a worthy thing to think about. I don&#8217;t think they explored it as much as they could have, however, which is unfortunate.</p>\n<p>The reason I bring up the philosophy aspect at all is because there has been some&#8230;internet bruhaha going on about JJ Abrams being quoted as saying something about NewTrek not being as philosophical as OlderTrek and Wil Wheaton taking umbrage with it, which has effectively drawn battle lines down the fandom. (sigh) I&#8217;m not trying to say either person&#8217;s POV is wrong. I&#8217;m just giving my own view on philosophy and Trek and where I think the NewTrek films stand on that bit.</p>\n<h3><strong>Into Confusion</strong></h3>\n<p>When I first watched the film, I came away with the feeling that I&#8217;d enjoyed it but it&#8217;d left me feeling rather confused.</p>\n<p>The first feeling has faded somewhat. The second feeling remains.</p>\n<p>Despite my years of fannishness for Trek, I&#8217;ve never seen <i>The Wrath of Khan</i>. I&#8217;ve seen the two majorly iconic scenes from it, but never the whole movie. Nor have I ever read the Wiki article, or any plot summary. I am effectively Khanless in my Trek-fan mental archive.</p>\n<p><i>Into Darkness</i> features Khan as the villain. I can&#8217;t say if the movie was anywhere similar to TWoK; I haven&#8217;t seen TWoK. I can say, however, I found myself questioning Khan&#8217;s motivations during the movie (I also was a bit lost as to the motivations of Admiral Marcus). I found myself wondering if this Khan was perhaps different from the old Khan, because of the alternate timeline scenario. I didn&#8217;t know <em>how to feel</em>, listening to Khan&#8217;s story. What was truth, what was a lie? I had no idea.</p>\n<p>I ended up feeling like I&#8217;d <i>missed</i> some crucial, pertinent info that I would have gleaned had I watched TWoK first. I felt as if <em>Into Darkness</em> was incomplete without having viewed TWoK first.</p>\n<p>This is ultimate failure on the part of the filmmakers. NewTrek is about revitalizing the series to draw in new fans. You shouldn&#8217;t feel like you&#8217;ve arrived in class without doing your homework or studying, and there&#8217;s a pop quiz (which is equivalent to how I felt).</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m still wondering what the hell I missed by not seeing TWoK first, and now I think I&#8217;ll have to sit down and watch it to see if it clears up any confusion for me.</p>\n<h3><strong>Into Predictability</strong></h3>\n<p>And yet, even though I&#8217;d never seen TWoK, I saw two scenes in Into Darkness coming from miles away. About halfway through the film I was able to predict the rest of the movie without many errors.</p>\n<p>By reaching back and grabbing an old villain from TOS, they effectively hindered any original storytelling they may have done and did a movie that felt like bad fanfic.</p>\n<p>Look, these actors are great. Quinto&#8217;s shout of &#8220;KHAAAAAANN!&#8221; was definitely much better than Shatner&#8217;s. Nate and I still laughed. Because it was so <i>obvious</i>.</p>\n<p>We also saw Kirk&#8217;s resurrection coming from a <i>mile</i> away. The second Bones mentioned using Khan&#8217;s blood on a dead Tribble it became very clear how they would save the life of the dead crewmember at the end &#8212; we just didn&#8217;t know, at that point, that it would be Kirk and not Spock.</p>\n<p>2009&#8217;s <em>Star Trek</em> was <em>not</em> predictable to me. I did not see everything coming. I didn&#8217;t really see anything coming. That made the movie end up on my top 10 list of favourite films.</p>\n<p>After the first half of the film being relentlessly confusing, the last half of the film was transparent in its journey. This is not how you do it, guys. You&#8217;re supposed to blend those two characteristics <strong>evenly</strong> over the course of the film, not split them down the middle and call it good.\u00a0<em></em></p>\n<h3><strong>Into Whitewashing</strong></h3>\n<p>Khan is supposed to be Indian, canonically speaking, and they did set it up that the Khan in this film was the same Khan from TWoK. So they cast Benedict Cumberbatch. Pasty white of the pasty whites.</p>\n<p>I think Cumberbatch would make an awesome <em>Star Trek</em> villain. But not Khan. They could have made the movie much, much better if they&#8217;d chosen either a different actor to play Khan or a different villain for Cumberbatch. Instead, they fell into the great hollywood tradition of whitewashing a role.</p>\n<p>At least in TWoK they got a POC actor to play Khan. And that was the 70s.</p>\n<p>On the subject of racism, <em>Into Darkness</em> went backwards on the progressive scale. Which is sad, considering Trek was created <em>to be progressive</em>.</p>\n<h3><strong>Into Reducing Female Characters to Their Relationships with Male Characters, and Also Fuck You for Thinking We&#8217;d Pass the Bechdel Test Ever</strong></h3>\n<p><em>Into Darkness</em> basically reduced Uhura to &#8220;Spock&#8217;s moody girlfriend&#8221;. They introduced a new female character, Carol, whose character was&#8230;basically defined as relating to her father, Admiral Marcus (the secondary villain). There were two female characters with names and lines, and both of them were entirely defined by their relationships to main male characters: Uhura as Spock&#8217;s girlfriend and Kirk&#8217;s friend, and Carol as Admiral Marcus&#8217; daughter, Bones&#8217; potential love interest, and another woman for Kirk to objectify.</p>\n<p>I honestly felt that Navigation Officer Darwin, played by Aisha Hinds (who I recognized from <em>True Blood</em>), was a better female character than either Uhura or Carol. Darwin didn&#8217;t need any relationship with a man to define her. She was concerned with doing her job, and she did it damn well.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_3810\" style=\"width: 366px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-3810\" alt=\"If not for her I bet the Enterprise would have crashed way sooner. \" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/katjevanloon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/navi.jpg\" width=\"356\" height=\"200\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">If not for her I bet the Enterprise would have crashed way sooner.</p></div>\n<p>I was hoping, after the first new Star Trek, which I loved quite a bit, that they&#8217;d take a chance in the later films to develop Uhura more as a character. She was great in the first film. Yes, emotionally attached to Spock, but not <em>defined</em> by said attachment. In this film she was literally nothing more than Spock&#8217;s SO. Spock&#8217;s <em>moody</em> SO, at that, and that was played up as if it were a negative thing <em>(women</em> and their <em>emotions</em> grossssss).</p>\n<p>Carol was a better developed character, but even then she fell far short of what she could have been. They didn&#8217;t even use her introduction as a chance for the film to pass the Bechdel test. She and Uhura had pretty much <i>zero</i> interaction.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s damn disappointing. I found myself hoping, when I saw the trailer, that the new female crewmember would get a non-man-related conversation with Uhura.</p>\n<p>(No, her conversation with Gaila in the first film <i>does not count</i> because it is not an actual conversation about something else; it is Uhura talking about her work in the lab while Gaila says &#8220;uh-huh!&#8221; a lot in an attempt to get Uhura out of the room so she doesn&#8217;t discover the half-naked Kirk under the bed. Definitely still a conversation <i>about a man</i>.)</p>\n<h3><strong>Into Darkness: the darkness of <em>we shit the fucking bed on this one</em></strong></h3>\n<p>This is a movie that&#8217;s like one of those pastries that tastes <em>awesome</em> while you&#8217;re eating it, but afterwards the taste it leaves in your mouth gets worse and worse, until you&#8217;re grasping for anything else as a palate cleanser. I enjoyed the film while I saw it. I got caught up in the emotions, the tensions, I loved the acting.</p>\n<p>The more time passes from when I saw it, the more I dislike it. It was equal parts confusing and predictable, it whitewashed, and it was downright sexist in its portrayal of women (except, possibly, Nav Off. Darwin). Some of those blows <em>may</em> have been softened if they&#8217;d upped the philosophy quotient, but they didn&#8217;t. And I&#8217;m not entirely sure it would have helped at all.</p>\n<p>Overall, extremely disappointed, and hope to gods that future NewTrek films actually try to move forward, instead of backwards.</p>\n<p>On the plus side, I guess, there was less lens flare this time.</p>\n<p>-Kat</p>\n", "post_id": 3808, "location": false, "date": "05-23-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>Full disclosure: I was given an ARC of this book on the condition I would review it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://abigailbarnettestheboss.blogspot.ca/\"><em>The Boss</em></a> is one of those books that I didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d get into all that much.</p>\n<p>Not because I don&#8217;t love Jenny Trout/Abigail Barnette. I do love her. <strong>I sort of hero worship her from afar and wish that I could be like her.</strong> I love her writing, especially on <a href=\"http://jennytrout.blogspot.ca/\">her blog</a>. (Fun fact: every time I press &#8220;j&#8221; in the URL bar the first site that autocompletes is her blog.)</p>\n<p>Honestly, I&#8217;m just not that big a fan of erotic romance. Generally speaking. I&#8217;ve enjoyed reading it in the past and I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll enjoy more in the future, but it&#8217;s not a genre I really actively seek out, and often it leaves me wanting (or rolling my eyes). Furthermore, I&#8217;m not a huge fan of BDSM/kinky erotic romance &#8212; not because I&#8217;m not kinky. Because I <em>am</em>, and so few BDSM erotica stories are actually hot to me (without being triggering &#8212; long story there; not worth getting into).</p>\n<p>I was worried because I knew <em>The Boss</em> was a male-dom/fem-sub erotic romance, and &#8212; even though I totally trust Barnette&#8217;s ability to write an erotic romance that I find hot, as I&#8217;d already read <em>Bride of the Wolf</em> a while ago &#8212; I&#8217;ve been burned before. (Not literally. Few of my partners have gone in for the candle wax thing.)\u00a0 So I was quite cautious.</p>\n<p><strong>I was pleasantly surprised. </strong><em>The Boss</em> was the hottest BDSM erotic romance I&#8217;ve ever read. I <em>could not</em> put it down, and not just because the sex was so fucking hot. The plot was compelling and intriguing, and I found myself trying to guess what would happen next (and only being right some of the time). The characters were well-developed and dynamic and they came across very clearly. When the book ended, I scrolled on my iPad <em>so hard</em> that I ended up loading another app. I then screamed out &#8220;<em>JENNNNNNNNNYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!</em>&#8221; <a href=\"http://youtu.be/T1iI3mGt2q8\">like this.</a> I wanted <strong>more</strong>.</p>\n<p>I could hear Neil and Sophie&#8217;s voices clearly in my head. I could picture them easily. (Neil was basically Anthony Head, because I find him <em>rawr</em>.) I loved their interactions; they were real and cute and funny and <em>heartbreaking</em> (in a totally good way). Often their relationship reminded me of mine, which made me smile and get all tingly.</p>\n<p>While I read <em>The Boss</em> I was completely wrapped up in what happened to the characters. I desperately wanted them all to succeed. (Except the antagonists. I wanted them to be set on fire.) When Neil had a headache, I felt concerned about his health. When Sophie died of mortification, I did too.</p>\n<p>The sex scenes were&#8230;steamy. And there were a lot of them, but not so much that they superseded the plot &#8212; in other words, just the <em>perfect amount</em> for an erotic romance. The amount of BDSM was perfect for me, too &#8212; obviously, your mileage will vary, but I personally don&#8217;t like the really hardcore ones. I prefer my sex (and scenes thereof) to be more Neapolitan than&#8230;um&#8230;Rocky Road? Whatever the ice cream equivalent of hardcore BDSM is. Anyway, people often forget that <em><strong>vanilla is a flavour</strong></em>. It is <em>not</em> the absence of flavour.</p>\n<p>But that&#8217;s a rant for another time.</p>\n<p>Basically, if you&#8217;re not terribly BDSM inclined, you&#8217;ll probably find <em>The Boss</em> very hot, and if you <em>are</em> BDSM inclined and don&#8217;t mind less hardcore erotica, then you&#8217;ll probably find <em>The Boss</em> very hot.</p>\n<p>And if you like romance, you&#8217;ll definitely love it.</p>\n<p>Bonus?<strong> The book passes the Bechdel test.</strong> That&#8217;s pretty fucking rare for heterosexual erotica or romance. Oh, and Sophie IDs as a feminist. <em>Win.</em></p>\n<p><em>The Boss</em> is the first in a trilogy. Books 2 and 3 aren&#8217;t out yet, but as soon as they are I&#8217;ll be grabbing them.<strong> I <em>need</em> to see what happens to these characters with whom I&#8217;ve fallen so in love.</strong></p>\n<p>If it sounds like this book is right up your alley, <a href=\"http://abigailbarnettestheboss.blogspot.ca/\">it&#8217;s being released a chapter per week at its own blog</a>.

This malware redirects you to porn or something else if you try to visit the mobile version of the site. It has no affect on the desktop versions that I can see, but use an iPad or phone to access the website and you&#8217;re going to get porn. Or taxi services. Or something. </p>\n<p>This site is not one of the affected sites. The affected sites are, of course, my mom&#8217;s site and my publishing site. </p>\n<p>I stayed up most of the night trying to fix the problem. Today is mom&#8217;s birthday and I wanted it to be&#8230;well, malware-free at least. </p>\n<p>At around 4 am I noticed there were buzzing insects in my room (which is also the library). A lot of them. A lot of black and yellow buzzing insects. </p>\n<p>Fuck. Wasps. About 8 in the room and TEN ON THE WINDOW OUTSIDE, TRYING TO GET IN.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/katjevanloon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/20130629-183819.jpg\" alt=\"20130629-183819.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /><br />\n<strong><em>Pictured: THE HIVE OF DOOM</em></strong></p>\n<p>I tried to close the window but I&#8217;m not strong enough. I was talking with the fiance and he asked if there was anywhere else I could sleep. No, I said. There&#8217;s the bed in the library or the floor in the kitchen, the floor in the bathroom, or the unfinished floor in the living room. That&#8217;s it.</p>\n<p>What about upstairs on the floor with your mom and the dog?</p>\n<p>Then I&#8217;d wake her up, and how better to truly ruin her day? </p>\n<p>I decided I&#8217;d sleep in the library and just pray to the gods I didn&#8217;t get stung. After I announced my plan to the Ogre, the wasps got angry. They heard what I&#8217;d said. They didn&#8217;t like my plan. They started divebombing the lamp, flying close to my face, buzzing with purpose. </p>\n<p>I said a hurried goodbye to the Ogre, clicked off Skype, and grabbed my pillow and blanket and ran. </p>\n<p>I slept on the bathroom floor. I figured, it&#8217;s heated and I can put towels and bathmats under me. Shouldn&#8217;t be too bad. </p>\n<p>I was wrong. </p>\n<p>Mom found me at 7am. She got me up and sent me upstairs to sleep on her bed and get an actual rest. </p>\n<p>My back still has not forgiven me. </p>\n<p>And then, as if sleeping on tile wasn&#8217;t enough for my poor body, at some point during my blissful sleep on mom&#8217;s bed I woke up and got up on one elbow, as if I were about to leave the bed. I then fell back asleep in that position and woke up a few hours later, still up on one elbow. My entire arm and left side had gone numb. I turned over onto my other side and the feeling started rushing back, undulating waves of numbness and tingling, dancing out blue and green in my brain. </p>\n<p>I ended up getting up around 2pm. Mom was not in a good mood, but the wasps were gone from the library at least. The malware is still on the websites, and I am still trying to fix it. </p>\n<p>But this story is a perfect example of how amazing my mom is. She woke up on her birthday to find me curled up on the bathroom floor because of a wasp infestation &#8212; another problem she has to deal with &#8212; when she&#8217;d gone to bed right after we discovered the malware problem. She went to bed with bad news and woke up to bad news, and you know what she did?</p>\n<p>Sent me to have a good sleep in her bed. </p>\n<p>Then she started baking koek. </p>\n<p>With a still-broken foot.</p>\n<p>And now we&#8217;re at Breakwater Books, where she plans on hosting the Live Poets&#8217; meeting. (If anyone shows; summer fell on a Saturday this year so everyone is out enjoying the sun. If no one shows, then she and I get to sit and write and read for a bit, which is awesome.) </p>\n<p>I&#8217;m fairly certain that, &#8217;twere I in her shoes, I would have crawled into my closet, cried, and left the Ogre to deal with the mess in our lives. </p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know how my mom got so good at handling crises. But she&#8217;s fantastic and she keeps me going, even on a day that&#8217;s supposed to be <em>for her</em>. </p>\n<p>And even on days when it gets to be too much, when she just has to have a good cry, she does so. She lets herself feel her emotions. And then she picks up the pieces and keeps going. She doesn&#8217;t let anything get her down for very long at all. </p>\n<p>So. You may wonder: <strong>how do I write such resilient, persistent, strong and brilliant female characters in my stories?</strong> </p>\n<p>I have one <em>hell</em> of a role model. </p>\n<p>-Kat</p>\n<p>PS Mercury is retrograde right now.

If you&#8217;re going to say anything about me or my mom, you have to admit we bounce back. <strong>Things break and we pick up the pieces and soldier on.</strong></p>\n<p>Last night a lot of things broke. Literally.</p>\n<p>We were sitting outside to eat dinner, as we have for a few nights since getting the pavilion back up on the concrete back porch. It had been down during the winter, but mom wanted it back up so I helped. Even with the millions of spiders living on it.</p>\n<p>The pavilion frame itself is kind of broken. (I&#8217;d show you a picture, but I didn&#8217;t realize I&#8217;d be writing this post at 1 am and it&#8217;s a bit too dark to snap a shot.) It&#8217;s bent and twisted like a gnarled oak tree. I&#8217;m surprised it stays up, to be honest.</p>\n<p>The table and chairs we eat on are nothing special: a plastic table with fold-out metal legs that we can fold flat and take in the car to events if needed, and two plastic lawn chairs. Barely deserving of the name.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;d finished dinner, mostly &#8212; I had, at any rate, and we&#8217;d both eaten our steaks, but mom was still working on one of the sides. While we ate Tyee sat by the table, on a leather lead held by me or mom. We&#8217;re trying to get him used to the idea of sitting by the table outside while we eat.</p>\n<p>I got up to take him to his tie-out chain so he could have a walk around the yard, relieve himself, etc, before mom took him to dog park after dinner was over. Well, he was having <em>none</em> of that. We&#8217;d tied him up earlier and he didn&#8217;t want it to happen again.</p>\n<p>So he bolted back to mom&#8217;s side. I sighed and hooked his leash onto something while I went back to deal with the tie-out, and then came back over. It hadn&#8217;t taken very long. In that time he&#8217;d managed to work himself under the table, out the other side, and around my empty chair. He then walked back towards the table, and his leash caught on my chair and dragged it. It stuttered on the concrete flooring, as plastic lawn chairs are wont to do.</p>\n<p><strong>And Tyee flipped. his. shit.</strong></p>\n<p>He bolted from the evil chair that was going to eat his soul, heading anywhere away from it. Of course, this hooked his leash on the table, and started to drag it after him and into mom. So he pulled harder. The table continued to drag, pushing mom over in her plastic chair. I rushed forward to catch her and lower her gently to the concrete ground so she didn&#8217;t hit her head. Tyee started running back and forth, in full panic mode now, and flipped the table over, spilling dishes and gravy everywhere. He ran into the pavilion and started to knock it down. Mom was now on the ground; I was holding her and pavilion up, half crouched amid a mess of broken dishes and gravy <em>everywhere.</em>\u00a0I finally managed to give Tyee an order to stop, and he did, shaking in fear.</p>\n<p>All that took place over the course of ten seconds. It was like a bomb going off. One moment, peaceful dinner time. The next moment, chaos, confusion, destruction, loud noises, and pain.</p>\n<p>Once I ascertained the pavilion would not fall on mom and that she was ok for a moment, I took Tyee over to his chain and tied him up so he&#8217;d be out of our hair while we fixed everything. We managed to get the pavilion more or less righted and then mom out of her chair and on her feet. She and I started to pick things up, and she managed to drop the table on her foot. Yes, the broken one.</p>\n<p><strong>Casualties list:</strong> 2 plates, 2 bowls, a gravy boat, mom&#8217;s favourite wine cup (blue-green-purple porcelain), all of the gravy, the remainder of mom&#8217;s dinner.</p>\n<p>I threw the broken dishes into the bushes, where mom throws all her broken pottery. (This is an old trick to keep wolf-dogs from lying down in your fucking garden; <em>Sila we&#8217;re looking at you</em>. Now she uses it to keep other animals out of her yard. It works.)</p>\n<p>When I went back inside I realized I was bleeding quite a bit from several small cuts in my legs and on my feet. As soon as I&#8217;d done as much cleaning outside as I could before we just needed to hose down the porch, I stepped into the shower to wash off blood and gravy.</p>\n<p>During all of this Tyee was basically having a PTSD episode. When we&#8217;d done all the work and mom was in the shower I let him back in the house and hugged him, trying to calm him with some torso compression. (This works for dogs, just like it works for humans.)</p>\n<p>Mom took him to dog park and I sat down and tried to calm down. I also got some lanterns out of the shed that <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> have a giant wasp&#8217;s nest on it in preparation for my flamekeeping shift tonight.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 384px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a title=\"Tonight's flamekeeping candle by Katje van Loon, on Flickr\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/katjevanloon/9196620643/\"><img alt=\"Tonight's flamekeeping candle\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/farm3.staticflickr.com/2878/9196620643_cfe79ab2b5.jpg\" width=\"374\" height=\"500\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Burning brightly beside me as I write this.</p></div>\n<p>Every 20 days I light a flame at sunset and keep it burning until sunset the next day in honor of Brighid, one of the three main deities I worship. (This flame does not have to be an fire-flame, and when I go to bed I blow out my actual candle and &#8220;light&#8221; an LED one.) This is called my &#8220;Cill shift&#8221; because I am a member of a Cill, or a group of people also dedicated to doing Brighid&#8217;s work in some capacity. We each have a shift in within the 20 day cycle, except day 20 &#8212; that&#8217;s the night that Brighid Herself will keep the flame.</p>\n<p>Brighid has within Her jurisdiction many things (like all gods, She can not be reduced to <em>one</em> facet). The things that seem to come up most often, however, are healing and the bardic arts. <strong>Poetry, writing, singing, <em>the creation of art</em>.</strong>\u00a0(So really, is it any surprise I&#8217;m Hers?)</p>\n<p><strong>I don&#8217;t often talk about my religion on this blog</strong> (I usually leave it for <a href=\"http://moragspinner.net\">The Mundane Mystic</a>), <strong>but today&#8217;s Cill shift did sort of tie into my main story for this post.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been a rough week, and I spent some time sitting and staring at the three candles I&#8217;d lit for Her at sunset, wishing that I was more <em>on top of things</em>. Every Cill shift I swear I&#8217;m going to <em>do</em> something, and every Cill shift something like tonight&#8217;s dog freakout happens. Or Brighid hits me in the head with a cosmic frying pan and knocks. me. out. Often for 20 hours. I get a really good sleep every 20 days, quite often.</p>\n<p>But in the ensuing hours, I&#8217;ve come to feel better about my complete <em>lack</em> of being able to do anything. Tyee started to calm down after we lit the lanterns, all three of them sitting on the righted table, casting shadows over the dark porch. He realized we still loved him, and all was well. (And then, after extinguishing the other two, I brought the last lantern inside, and it spooked him. <strong>Which makes me seriously question the veracity of those images of Hecate, torch in hand, with Her dog beside Her.</strong>)</p>\n<p>And, ok. I&#8217;m <em>writing.</em> Here, in my blog. I&#8217;ve done some serious writing tonight, and tomorrow when I wake up and get some coffee I can continue work on <em>From the Ashes</em>, which I&#8217;ve done over 5,000 words on in the past 2 days. I can also work on editing\u00a0<em>The Jade Star of Athering\u00a0</em>in prep for sending it off to my beta readers. Slowly, but surely, I will finish these projects.</p>\n<p>All creative work is within Brighid&#8217;s realm, and I&#8217;m doing that stuff. So <strong>I can stop beating myself up about these things and just be happy with what I <em>can</em> accomplish.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s honestly one of the hardest lessons to learn. I&#8217;ll still be learning it for years to come.</p>\n<p>But every day, I get a little bit closer to knowing it in my bones.

He has leverage with cons because he\u2019s an award-winning, well-known author in the SF circuit. They want to put him on the guest list to attract fans to come to the con, because fans coming to the con means the con actually goes on. (You can\u2019t run an event without money flowing\u00a0<i>somewhere</i>.) This is Event Ecology 101.</p>\n<p>What\u2019s even better?

Dragon*Con, 2009.\u00a0<b>I was lucky</b>, because I was there with a large group of friends \u2013 friends who watched out for me, protected me, looked after me. Especially when I was twenty sheets to the wind, stumbling down the streets screaming \u201cI LOVE YOU ATLANTA!\u201d (1 large Pixie Stick + 1 pint of vodka X 2 = Starbuck!Kat).</p>\n<p>I didn\u2019t get harassed. The closest anyone came, if I recall correctly, was when I got a picture with some dude dressed like Snape and he was a bit of a creeper. PSA, folks: if you get a pic with someone you don\u2019t know and you have your arm around their shoulder, don\u2019t rub their shoulder with your thumb. Not alluring, not seductive. Just gross.</p>\n<p>But otherwise, no. I had a safe, fun time at my only con, free of harassment. People were nothing but kind to me.</p>\n<p>And I realize, fully, that\u00a0<b><i>had I not been surrounded by friends</i>\u00a0I may have had a bad time</b>. It was my first con and it\u2019s probably the biggest con out there. It\u2019s likely I may have been harassed.</p>\n<p>This is not a \u201coh, it only happens at\u00a0<i>those</i>\u00a0cons\u201d thing either.\u00a0<b>It happened at WisCon</b>. The\u00a0<i>feminist</i>\u00a0SFF convention.</p>\n<p>Harassment happens everywhere and anywhere, and for a long time our entire culture has been helping perpetrators find more victims while throwing the victims under the bus. It is one thread in the tapestry of rape culture \u2013 the culture we\u2019ve built that tells folks consent and boundaries don\u2019t have to be respected, tells us that certain folks are entitled to certain things from other folks, tells us that if we follow the rules it won\u2019t happen to us, tells us that if it does happen to us it must have been our fault, somehow.</p>\n<p>Read any comment thread on these issues and you\u2019ll see people spouting the same bullshit arguments, ranging anywhere from standard victim-blaming to \u201cOH NOES ,THE FEMINISTS R PUSHING THEIR AGENDAZ ON US\u201d.\u00a0<b>Yes, the agenda of getting people to stop harassing other people. What a fucking concept.</b></p>\n<p>(Now, granted, the original posts linked in the link round-up will be, probably, much better with the comment threads than, say, the internet in general. But I\u2019ve not even finished reading Scalzi\u2019s comment thread and already people have come in with victim-blaming and OH NOES TEH FEMINISSSTSSSS. So even at a place with excellent comment modding, it will happen.)</p>\n<p>So I\u2019ve signed. I don\u2019t have the clout Scalzi does (yet), and so far as I know there aren\u2019t any readers out there who really want me to come to a con (yet). But I am a participant in con life, or I was for one brief shining moment when I could afford the trip out there. And I plan on going to cons in the future \u2013 as participant, as guest, as fan and human being.</p>\n<p>And, like Scalzi,<b>\u00a0I don\u2019t want to support any con that does not have a clear harassment policy in place.

But it continues to perpetrate the oppressive power structures found in the overculture it comes from, and\u00a0<i>that\u2019s a problem</i>.</p>\n<p>I want to see a subculture of the future that is better than that, and I think that we can do it.

There&#8217;s construction going on nearby for the new Skytrain, and they&#8217;re doing it all night. I have to sleep with my window open when it&#8217;s so hot, so at night my bedroom is full of the sounds of heavy machinery beeping and men shouting at each other.</p>\n<p>Eventually, I did start to fall asleep.</p>\n<p>And was immediately waked up by a shout of terror from my mom&#8217;s room. I got out of my bed in blind panic, stumbling through the apartment to her room, one thought going through my sleep-fogged brain:<em> he&#8217;s done it. He&#8217;s finally found a way to kill her.</em></p>\n<p>When I was 9 the divorce got started, got put into motion. The litigation from it lasted until I was 20. It was named the second-worst divorce case in BC history.</p>\n<p><strong>My father, my mom&#8217;s ex-husband, is abusive, violent, and unpredictable.</strong> He&#8217;s also a gun-owner*, which is not a happy mixture. Living with him is walking on eggshells. You never know what will set him off.</p>\n<p>For a long time, I was deadly afraid of him &#8212; I was afraid of what he could do to <em>me</em>. I feared he&#8217;d succeed in gaining custody of me. I feared the abuse. When he got really angry, I feared he&#8217;d snap and kill me.</p>\n<p>Eventually, the fear of what he could do to <em>my person</em> faded. I became an angry, jaded, bitter adolescent, and I was suicidal. I no longer thought he&#8217;d kill me; often I&#8217;d fantasize about killing myself to show him who was in charge. I dyed my hair and got piercings and tattoos, because I was exercising control over my body. After spending a lifetime with one parent trying to exert complete, absolute control over not only your physical person but your thoughts, your emotions, your beliefs\u2026I grasped onto anything that could give me a sense of control again, and I held on hard.</p>\n<p>I cut myself. I binge-ate. I starved myself. Mom tried so hard to keep me healthy, but there was only so much she could do without becoming another controlling influence in my eyes; without losing my trust. She did the best she could with what she had, and in my eyes that makes her the best mom in the world. She&#8217;s the reason I didn&#8217;t kill myself.</p>\n<p>The fear that I had of my father didn&#8217;t go away, however. I spent years appeasing him, years trying to keep him happy with me, because I feared he&#8217;d kill my mother.</p>\n<p>He hated my mother. Every time I visited him there was some ranting about what a horrible person she was, how she was making me fat and lazy and all these other things that meant I&#8217;d never be loved by anyone else. How I was <em>just like her</em> and this was, of course, a terrible thing. And though he never realized I knew it, I could hear the comments, I understood what he meant with his veiled barbs: <strong>he wanted her dead.</strong></p>\n<p>So for years I tried to be the daughter he wanted. I tried to be the trophy he wanted to keep on his mantlepiece, perfectly under his control; when I couldn&#8217;t do that, I tried to at least not piss him off so much.</p>\n<p>It was a losing, uphill battle. My very existence troubles him &#8212; he once called me <em>the most expensive mistake he ever made</em> &#8212; because I am so much like her. My mother. Because I remind him of her; because I came from her; because he hates her.</p>\n<p>Sunday night mom&#8217;s shout of terror brought me tearing out of my bed and down the hall, not even grabbing a weapon, hoping to beat him back with fists and claws and the pure rage of a daughter who&#8217;s spent zir life trying to protect one parent from the other. I was convinced he was there, in the apartment &#8212; he knows where it is, after all; my Oma owned it for 20 years before she died &#8212; I was convinced he had finally come to off my mother. A final revenge for when I cast him out of my life last year because I was finally done entertaining his clumsy, toxic &#8220;love&#8221;.**</p>\n<p>Mom, of course, is fine; <strong>it had only been a bad dream</strong>. Her screams didn&#8217;t even wake the dog, who was fast asleep in the living room. I think he would have started from sleep had a new smell entered the house, and he&#8217;s not exactly fond of tall, widely-built men.</p>\n<p>I, however, took another hour to get back to sleep. My heart didn&#8217;t stop its rapid pulse for at leas 45 minutes; I breathed rapidly, straining my ears for any sound, any indication that what I feared may actually come to pass. That night I had terrible nightmares all night that kept me tossing and turning; nightmares about him.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s like terrorism. <strong>Living under the fear of your abuser, living under the fear that he will come back and hurt you &#8212; it is a special, personal type of terrorism.</strong> And for me, until my father dies I will be living in the shadow of that fear &#8212; the fear that he&#8217;ll take away my mom, the most important person in my life.</p>\n<p>He&#8217;s already tried and failed to take away my sense of self-worth, my ability to be loved, and my autonomy. My mother is the last thing he can take from me, and I&#8217;m afraid I won&#8217;t have the power to stop him if he decides to try.</p>\n<p>And that fear won&#8217;t go away, unless I let him back into my life and try to keep him happy. Unless I sacrifice my own mental well-being. Unless I decide to accept the suicidal ideation, the worsened eating disorders, the fear he&#8217;ll invade my space yet again on one of his &#8220;spontaneous trips&#8221; to my town. Unless I decide to make myself miserable just so I can keep him happy, and keep a well-trained eye on him, and keep him <em>away. from. my. mother.</em></p>\n<p>That fear stays. Because mom and I have talked about it, and we both agree &#8212; nothing is worth the way he hurts me. Nothing. And even if I did do all that, it wouldn&#8217;t be a sure thing. There would always be a chance he&#8217;d do it anyway. In a situation like this, <strong>there is no such thing as security.</strong></p>\n<p>I refuse to give up my liberty for a false sense of it.</p>\n<p>-Kat</p>\n<p>*This is not an attack on gun-owners. However, my father is USian and he did bring with him said attitude towards guns. He frequently disobeys Canadian gun laws, because he thinks he&#8217;s above them, and once &#8212; when I was young &#8212; he almost shot me while he sleptwalked. So while I do have friends who are gun-owners and don&#8217;t have anything against guns per se, I&#8217;m not too keen on them being kept by an abusive, violent, arrogant man who believes he&#8217;s above the law and talks frequently about &#8220;hunting&#8221; women.</p>\n<p>**I&#8217;m sure he does think he loves me, in his way. It&#8217;s still clumsy, toxic, and abusive, and I deserve better.</p>\n", "post_id": 3869, "location": false, "date": "08-01-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["I probably swear too much", "magical fucking weapons"], "text": "<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>Least favorite plot device employed by way too many books you actually enjoyed otherwise</strong></p>\n<p>I honestly can&#8217;t think of a plot device employed by &#8220;way&#8221; too many books that I otherwise enjoyed, so I&#8217;ll just go with one that seems pretty common with, I don&#8217;t know, all the genres I&#8217;m into (not just books).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>MAGICAL FUCKING WEAPONS!</strong></p>\n<p>The main characters aren&#8217;t powerful all by themselves, you see.

Ashe from the same series has a sword whose name I can&#8217;t remember that allows the user to breath underwater (much like my BOP Hydrocane in WoW). Many animes or mangas have some sort of magical fucking weapon (MOON PRINCESS ELIMINATION). Arthas has Frostmourne (hells, that magical weapon is like, the whole POINT of the story!). \u00a0Gaius Baltar has his cock that makes women&#8217;s spines glow red (now THERE&#8217;S a magical<em> fucking </em>weapon, eh?).</p>\n<p>Even I have used this plot device (magical weapons, not Baltar&#8217;s cock).

And you never expected this from your favorite Witchy author, right?</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m sorry to disappoint.</p>\n<p>BUT.</p>\n<p>Nearly everything in English literature is based off ideas found in the Bible &#8212; or based off a <em>rejection</em> of those ideas. Only in more contemporary work are we seeing people really start to move away from that influence. Reading the Bible &#8212; or, hell, reading the Cliff&#8217;s Notes version, for those of us who are not terribly masochistic &#8212; can deepen one&#8217;s understanding of favorite poems or stories in English lit.</p>\n<p>Not to mention, reading the Bible will prepare you SO well for any English lit class you take. True story. I was there. And I was one of the few people in class who actually knew the Biblical stories being referenced in the stories we were reading &#8212; and I&#8217;m a Pagan.</p>\n<p>So, seriously, if you appreciate literature and you want to deepen that appreciation, or if you&#8217;re about to take an English lit class and you&#8217;d like to be the smartest asshole in class (as I \u00a0am), I recommend reading or at least familiarizing yourself with the stories in the Bible. Another good option is the Classical myths, which are severely under-taught in schools, in my opinion. You know what, fucking read both. You can&#8217;t go wrong with that. Also Greek myths are full of great stuff like rape and incest and shit; real edge-of-your-seat thrillers. (The Bible is full of that stuff too, by the way.)</p>\n<p>Not only that, it&#8217;s awesome to have actually read the Bible so when those door-to-door jerkwads* come by to tell you about Jesus Christ you can tell them off, cause I\u00a0guaran-fucking-tee\u00a0you you&#8217;ll probably have more knowledge about the book than they do at that point.</p>\n<p>And if you are of the Christian stripe and you haven&#8217;t read the Bible**, you should so you can tell off that dumb Pagan kid who thinks he knows more about your religion than you do.</p>\n<p>*I&#8217;m not religiously intolerant; I&#8217;m &#8220;Coming to my door at 8am on a fucking Saturday&#8221; intolerant.</p>\n<p>**Seriously, guys?</p>\n<p>Also, yes, I&#8217;m aware that the Old Testament is also known as the Torah and it is the book of the Jewish faith, and that the New Testament is really the Christian part.

(We&#8217;re currently searching for a place to move in to together, but in the meantime it&#8217;s week-at-my-house, weekend-at-his.)</p>\n<p>His mom had to head down to Washington this weekend to visit a friend.

Also, she said, one of the things she was picking up was my birthday gift &#8212; so there was some incentive for me!</p>\n<p>First thing we did as soon as we got across the border was find a Jack in the Box. Jack in the Box is by far our favourite fast food place and we will always make time to visit one when we head into the Western States. (It doesn&#8217;t exist out east. I don&#8217;t even think it exists too far east of the West Coast.) And by &#8220;we&#8221; I mean &#8220;Amoeba Cat and Ogre&#8221;. OgreMom has a lot of food sensitivities, so eating at fast food while on a road trip is sort of a really terrible idea (especially when she&#8217;d not been feeling well for a few days before).</p>\n<div style=\"width: 385px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a title=\"Damn straight I will. by Katje van Loon, on Flickr\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/katjevanloon/9458167472/\"><img alt=\"Damn straight I will.\" src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7326/9458167472_a559cf97c2.jpg\" width=\"375\" height=\"500\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Oh yeah, you know it.</p></div>\n<p>My normal meal at Jack in the Box is the Ultimate Cheeseburger, which is basically just meat and cheese and bread, but this time they had a new one &#8212; with bacon.

I&#8217;m also guessing it&#8217;s common across US fast food places (it&#8217;s not in Canada), to help combat the &#8220;obesity epidemic&#8221;. (Because obese people are the <em>enemy,</em> folks. We&#8217;re the new communists, donchaknow.)</p>\n<p>Personally, I found it <em>incredibly upsetting,</em> and were I in a worse state of mind that evening I probably would have been triggered. When I noticed the calories on the menu, I felt like I was being publicly shamed for choosing a meal that was so high in caloric intake. I felt like everyone was watching me, looking at the thing I was choosing and how BIG that number was beside it and judging me for it. And, as I feel <em>every time I look at the calories</em> on a piece of food, I started to feel the slippery slide into my eating disorders.</p>\n<p>I had to force myself to look away and not think about it, though I managed to snap a picture as we were leaving. I repeated a mantra over and over in my head that Ogre loves me and doesn&#8217;t judge me for the food I eat. He never tells me to eat less; he doesn&#8217;t try to control my food input. Which is quite magical, considering, well, every other guy I&#8217;ve dated and lots of other people in my life that I&#8217;ve not been romantically involved with. Oh, yeah, and society at large.

Get thee to a Netflix and watch. You will not regret it. (If you do regret it&#8230;well, it&#8217;s safe to say you probably don&#8217;t share my sense of humor. Which is sad. <em>I am sad now</em>.)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">True story: it&#8217;s my heart&#8217;s dream that someday the Ogre and I <em>are</em> Bob and Linda and our kids are Louise, Gene, and Tina. Also, I may or may not be obsessed with the show because I basically <em>am</em> a combination of the three kids.</p>\n<p>After JitB we pretty much headed straight to the person we were visiting, with a few stops for gas and bathrooms on the way. (Man, gas is cheap in Washington. No, the exchange rate doesn&#8217;t make it a &#8220;no real difference&#8221; sort of deal; Washington is paying around 3.50 a gallon and Vancouver is paying around 5.20 a gallon. 5.20 Canadian is about 4.90 US, not 3.50.)</p>\n<p>The visit purpose was two-fold: visit the kittens, and pick up OgreMom&#8217;s stuff. Including my birthday present. Which is awesome. You will see this in a minute. First, however: KITTENS.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 385px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a title=\"Dancer cat! by Katje van Loon, on Flickr\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/katjevanloon/9458143482/\"><img alt=\"Dancer cat!\" src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7296/9458143482_623059bf1f.jpg\" width=\"375\" height=\"500\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">He wants to be a dancer.

The kitty has some sort of hip problem, so his legs just sort of spread-eagle no matter what. He wasn&#8217;t in much, if any, pain, and he was cool with being held and cuddled. His legs just splay like crazy, but it really doesn&#8217;t stop him from crawling all over the place and dragging them behind him. Because of this I think he should be named Troy, but no one appreciates my constant references to <em>Community.</em> (And yes, I realize y&#8217;all can&#8217;t exactly tell by the picture, but the kitten is fine with being held like that and it was only long enough for me to snap a picture, anyway. Don&#8217;t worry, Ogre may look big and scary but he actually knows how to handle cats. His mom only fostered a <em>million</em> kittens while he was growing up.)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">So, anyway, here are some more pictures of kittens:</p>\n<div style=\"width: 385px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a title=\"Ogre and kitten. by Katje van Loon, on Flickr\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/katjevanloon/9455352937/\"><img alt=\"Ogre and kitten.\" src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7422/9455352937_b151b50c5a.jpg\" width=\"375\" height=\"500\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Say it with me. &#8220;D&#8217;AAAWWWWWWWWW&#8221;</p></div>\n<div style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a title=\"Me holding a kitty. by Katje van Loon, on Flickr\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/katjevanloon/9458106224/\"><img alt=\"Me holding a kitty.\" src=\"https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2833/9458106224_3c48706a2b.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Let me tell you, they may be young but their claws are fully developed.

It encouraged children to read and exercise their imaginations, and &#8212; this is the best part &#8212; it was produced and hosted by LeVar Burton.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">As far as TV shows go, I was raised on <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em> and <em>Reading Rainbow. </em>At first, I wondered why Geordi was without his visor, but then the concept of actors vs. characters was explained to me, and I adjusted.</p>\n<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='420' height='315' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/844DzynPG-w?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The show helped foster a love of literature in me. Despite my eventual voraciousness regarding books and my high levels of reading comprehension, for a while mom was afraid I wouldn&#8217;t actually learn to read, period. It never came easy to me, and even now I am an extremely slow reader. I have to be awake and alert if I want to read books and comprehend them, and it takes me a while.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">For someone with those difficulties, fostering a love of the literary world could be difficult. But on the TV, I had Geordi &#8212; Geordi, my friend from <em>Star Trek</em>, one of my favourite characters from that show, the guy who seemed <em>safe</em> to me. And here he was, showing me that reading could take me anywhere, and help me be anything. I <em>could</em> go twice as high.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">So you can see why I&#8217;m overjoyed with this shirt. It proclaims my love for <em>Reading Rainbow</em> without being billboardesque, and its appeal to the imagination harkens back to the theme of the show. Definitely up there among some of the best birthday gifts ever.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">After our visit, we headed home &#8212; and to a Wal-Mart. Whenever Ogre is in the States he picks up underwear from Wal-Mart (or wherever else has the same-priced underwear, but often it&#8217;s Wal-Mart because of the odd hours he keeps &#8212; they&#8217;ve usually got a 24hr-open store). Canada doesn&#8217;t have the underwear he likes in his size, so we must go to the States and buy underwear made in the face of the looming problem of <em>fatties</em> within the nation&#8217;s borders. <em>Oh no! Hide the children!</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I mean, I find it sort of fucking ridiculous that he can&#8217;t find underwear that fits him up here. You would think that regardless the <em>moral panic</em> surrounding the very <em>existence</em> of fatties in whatever country they would at least supply us some fucking underwear. I mean, seeing as it&#8217;s <em>such a problem</em> when we show the slightest amount of skin.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I, too, have trouble finding underwear that a) fits, b) is the style I like, c) is comfortable, d) well-made, and e) in my budget. By &#8220;I have trouble,&#8221; I mean &#8220;I usually wear underwear until it just <em>disintegrates</em> so I don&#8217;t have to go through the horror of shopping for more for as long as possible.&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I digress again. Apparently the Amoeba Cat is grumpy today.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">So, we went in search of some underwear, as all his current pairs are approaching sainthood. (&#8216;Cause they&#8217;re <em>holey</em>&#8230;get it?) While we were there we decided to see if there was any junk food that we couldn&#8217;t easily get in Canada. Also, I took a picture of some booze I saw that I wanted to remember at a later time &#8212; as it was 2:30 am when we were shopping and my brain was unlikely to remember the details without some help.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 385px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a title=\"*cough* by Katje van Loon, on Flickr\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/katjevanloon/9458087044/\"><img alt=\"*cough*\" src=\"https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3825/9458087044_2427815eef.jpg\" width=\"375\" height=\"500\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Definitely sounds like something I need to try.

In glass bottles, no less. 12 Cokes, 6 Sprite, 6 Orange Fanta. Out of the three of them the Fanta has the worst ingredients, but still &#8212; no HFCS.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">And they all taste <em>so much better</em> than Canadian- or US-made pop.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Overall, a really fun and productive trip (I got an hour of work done, if you can believe it). We stumbled back into our home at 3:30am; Ogre and I didn&#8217;t fall asleep till 7:30 or so.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Next time we road trip to the States we will hopefully have more notice before leaving and the trip itself will be a bit longer.

They&#8217;re a 14+ store, so there&#8217;s an actual chance I could get it. I do have modelling experience, and apparently I&#8217;m pretty damn hot and confident (haha, <em>what</em>)<em>.</em> The first step is to submit headshot and full body pic.</p>\n<p>And that first step is basically the biggest fucking hurdle I have ever encountered. First I think <em>well maybe I&#8217;ll submit my headshot, professionally done, from 2 years ago</em>, but <em>no,</em> says the other part of my brain, <em>no it needs to be CURRENT or you&#8217;re fucking your chances,</em> which is TRUE, so where the hell am I going to get a current headshot? Where the hell am I going to get a current full body shot?</p>\n<p>With, remember, like zero funds, because that&#8217;s what I have right now. I do have friends who are pro photographers, which is why I&#8217;d never ask them to shoot me for free; fuck, I&#8217;m an artist too, <em>we need to be paid.</em></p>\n<p>So that&#8217;s one battle. Another is the fact that <em>I would just really love to write for <a href=\"http://www.xojane.com/\">xoJane</a></em> but, well, I have no idea how to go about even applying for that sort of job and I&#8217;m pretty much solidly convinced they wouldn&#8217;t want me anyway because whatever I say could probably be said a million times better by <a href=\"http://www.xojane.com/author/marianne\">Marianne Kirby</a> or <a href=\"http://www.xojane.com/author/emily\">Emily McCombs</a>. I don&#8217;t have a real journalism background, besides writing for the paper at Maui Community College, and times like these I actually regret not getting my degree in Journalism or something.</p>\n<p>And, because we can&#8217;t stop at just <em>two</em> battlefields on which the two parts of my brain can duke it out, there are the burlesque and &#8220;being an adult&#8221; things. Becoming Burlesque is coming up again, and I really really really want to take the class, but, well. Two big hurdles there: 1. my spine and 2. money, which basically are <em>both</em> money, because my spine is <em>still</em> fucked because I can&#8217;t afford physical therapy. (No, Canada doesn&#8217;t cover it, and I&#8217;m &#8220;not disabled enough&#8221; to have it (or anything else!) covered by disability. Because <em>not being able to work or even clean my house IF I can even get out of bed</em> is apparently, you know, perfectly fucking healthy, go get a job you lazy bitch. Thanks Canada!)</p>\n<p>But, you know, even if I could get over those hurdles in time to sign up for this class the chances of my doing it are slim, because again: CRIPPLING SELF-DOUBT, my favourite bedfellow, jerk hogs the fuckin&#8217; covers.</p>\n<p>And I mean, at this point do I even really <em>need</em> to go into being an adult and why that&#8217;s such a problem for me? No. No I do not.

(I am a fan of taking pictures of particularly appetizing looking meals, but trust me, you are not seeing my full diet if you look at my Flickr account.) Even if it has become somewhat gratuitous, I fail to see it as a wholly bad thing.</p>\n<p>In fact, I see it as a good thing.</p>\n<p>When I was in high school I did not spend a lot of time looking in the mirror in order to take account of my many good features. I spent a lot of time in front of the mirror popping zits or telling myself about my many imperfections: my eyebrows were too thick, my eyes had dark shadows under them, my skin was oily enough to end America&#8217;s dependence on the Middle East (too soon?), my hair was gross (and I dyed it constantly, in defiance of its old carpet-like natural colour), my pupils were different sizes and that was WEIRD, I had a double chin which was <em>undoubtedly</em> gross&#8230;the list goes on.</p>\n<p><strong>I did not like myself. This should be expected; I was being raised in a world that didn&#8217;t like me, that spent a lot of time and effort in telling me all the ways I was imperfect.</strong> The media is tailored to give young girls and women (and boys and men, to a lesser extent) such insecurities about themselves, because it is a byproduct of our society &#8212; the same society who raised our mothers to believe the same thing, and to say the same things about themselves.</p>\n<p>My mom is pretty much perfect in my eyes, so don&#8217;t think this is going to be a mother-blaming post; it&#8217;s not. But she doesn&#8217;t love herself the way she should &#8212; the way I think she should, which is how I love her. Unconditionally, wholly, with the view that she is a goddess. She is, to me.<strong> I think she&#8217;s beautiful and I love her and she&#8217;s my <em>mom.</em> </strong></p>\n<p>But she was raised in this same patriarchal society that I was, and she was given the same messages: her worth is only inherent in her fuckability, and her fuckability is determined by her attractiveness. My mom was always called a handsome woman, which is a &#8220;kind&#8221; euphemism for &#8220;not feminine enough&#8221;. And we all know if you&#8217;re not <em>feminine</em> enough as a woman, you&#8217;re not <em>beautiful.</em></p>\n<p>To which I say: fuck that, my mom is <em>beautiful.</em> And screw traditional ways of looking at femininity or masculinity anyway. She identifies as a woman and considers herself feminine; that&#8217;s enough for her it should be enough for everyone else.</p>\n<p><strong>Basically, if you think my mother isn&#8217;t feminine enough, or beautiful enough, or anything enough, I have a very short pier off which I&#8217;d like you to take a long walk. With these barbells tied to your feet, please. There&#8217;s a good lad.</strong></p>\n<p>Because of all this patriarchal bullshit that tells women, or people being raised as women, or people who are socially classed as women, that our worth is directly connected to our beauty, and our beauty is judged in very narrow terms, my mom and I have spent most of our lives not liking ourselves very much. <em>Physically,</em> I mean; I think we&#8217;re both doing rather better on the liking ourselves mentally or even emotionally or spiritually, but it&#8217;s still a huge struggle for us to like our bodies, or our faces.</p>\n<p>But I have been working to change this about myself, and the selfie has been helping me.</p>\n<p>I started taking selfies in my late teens, on the cusp of adulthood. Most of them I hated, as I hated myself, but every once in a while I&#8217;d get a good shot, with good light, or the just right angle, or the perfect expression. Often these were &#8220;Myspace angles&#8221;, ie, angles where I was looking up at the camera, to minimize the fat rolls under my chin and to make my breasts look more impressive; obviously I was still very much in the woods of self-loathing for a great many years.</p>\n<p>But these selfies served their purpose.</p>\n<p>With every good shot, I chipped away a little bit at the thick shell of <em>gods I&#8217;m so ugly</em> that surrounded me. Every time I did this, I came closer and closer to realizing that&#8230;hey, I wasn&#8217;t bad looking. Hey, maybe I was kind of attractive. Hey, wow, <em><strong>I&#8217;m fucking gorgeous.</strong> </em></p>\n<p>Until finally, this week, it culminates in this: my being able to take a selfie of myself without make-up, without a bra on, without a Myspace-angle &#8212; just me in the clothes I threw on after my shower to sit around my hose &#8212; and to look at it and say, &#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;m pretty hot. I can see why the Ogre would want to bang me. And hell, probably other folks too; he&#8217;s just the only one of which I&#8217;m aware.&#8221;</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-3998\" alt=\"20130904_231841_Anne_Vignette_Intertwined\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/katjevanloon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/20130904_231841_Anne_Vignette_Intertwined-768x1024.jpg\" width=\"511\" height=\"680\" /></p>\n<p>And some people may find this a direct contradiction of my feminist ideals; after all, I think it&#8217;s pretty gross that our entire society values women in terms of their fuckability. It is.</p>\n<p>However. While our society is patriarchal/kyriarchal in nature, and while these messages are <em>mostly</em> directed at girls and women, I do believe <strong>the lack of self-esteem that comes from one&#8217;s own perceived lack of fuckability transcends gender</strong>. I have known people of various genders who feel shitty because they feel ugly, and they believe that ugliness leads to them being unfuckable. Yes, many, many women, but many men too, and many non-binary folk (like myself).</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t think that our inherent worth is tied up in our fuckability/beauty, but <strong>I do think that our perceived self-worth matters a hell of a lot.</strong> This is one of those areas where self-care intersects, somewhat awkwardly, with feminist activism, for me &#8211;<strong> I can&#8217;t be an effective activist if I&#8217;m mired in self-loathing to the point of not being able to leave my bed</strong>. So if that means taking selfies until I feel that I&#8217;m worthy as a human being, even if my worth isn&#8217;t actually tied to my physical attractiveness and I&#8217;m basing this entire process on what is essentially a lie told to me by society, well, that means taking selfies until I feel I&#8217;m worthy as a human being.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m all for dismantling the patriarchy, for dismantling the fucked up, toxic society we live in. Yes, it needs to change; we need to stop equating physical attractiveness (which is subjective <em>anyway)</em> with human worth. We really do.</p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s really hard to get down to the work of actually dismantling this oppressive, toxic wasteland, if depression and anxiety and self-loathing have conspired to keep you curled up in bed, unable to even get up to turn on the lights. If someone needs to feel they are attractive in order to have the strength to carry on, then they need that and it would be downright cruel (and possibly, an act of silencing and denying their agency) to try to take that away from them.</p>\n<p><strong>Furthermore, as a fat woman/person socially-classed-as-woman, taking selfies that proclaim to the world your attractiveness is a downright <em>subversive</em> act. And I don&#8217;t think I need to explain <em>why.</em> </strong></p>\n<p>So leave folks who take selfies alone. Chances are, they&#8217;re searching for this same sort of self-care. Maybe it&#8217;s not the self-care route you would take, but that doesn&#8217;t invalidate it. Maybe you think there are too many out there, but hell, there are too many blogs out there and I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s how many people find ways of caring for themselves.</p>\n<p>And if it bugs you to see selfies from people you perceive as ugly, then that&#8217;s just proof that selfies need to continue for a while yet. Yes, I will normalize my appearance to the world and myself, because I&#8217;m not ugly, so fuck you.</p>\n<p>A toast to the selfie! May it continue, until we don&#8217;t need it anymore, and then may it be a fun choice that anyone can make, or not make, as they will.</p>\n<p>-Kat</p>\n", "post_id": 3997, "location": false, "date": "09-08-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["to be fair i say UNF about kit-kat bars too but trust me THIS BOOK IS HAWT", "fiction", "Romance", "Jenny Trout", "books", "Pirates and Fairies", "BDSM", "Abigail Barnette", "erotica"], "text": "<p><em><a href=\"http://jennytrout.wordpress.com/2013/08/15/the-girlfriend-is-available-to-order-in-print-on-demand-paperback/\"><img class=\"alignright\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://jennytrout.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/the-girlfriend.jpg?w=300&#038;h=451\" width=\"300\" height=\"451\" /></a><strong>The Girlfriend</strong></em><strong>, by Abigail Barnette</strong> (ie, Jenny Trout, my idol), is the sequel to the much-loved <em>The Boss</em>. I was lucky enough to win a copy in the giveaway she held in August. I read the first five chapters before Pirates and Faeries, and now I&#8217;m trying to ration myself on the rest of them. When I finished <em>The Boss</em>, I ended up scrolling to the left so hard it excited the ebook-reading app. Then I screamed JENNNNYYYYYYYYYYYYY as if I were Kirk and she Khan.</p>\n<p>Want to know a bit more about <em>The Boss</em>?

Here&#8217;s a pretty good assessment:</p>\n<blockquote><p>It\u2019s an erotic romance with a kinky Dom billionaire and a twenty-something sub, written specifically to counter all the abusive, non-con stuff in\u00a0<em>50 Shades of Grey.\u00a0</em>I\u2019ve heard it described as\u00a0<strong><em>The Devil Wears Prada</em> meets <em>The Secretary</em></strong>. I think that\u2019s apt.<em><br />\n</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>It&#8217;s erotica, and it&#8217;s definitely on my list of favourite sexytimes books. <em>The Girlfriend</em> is just as good, so far, and really really hot. <em>UNF.</em> Also sweet! And <strong>funny.</strong> Several times while reading it I&#8217;ve laughed out loud and the Ogre has been all &#8220;What&#8217;s so funny?&#8221; and I&#8217;ll tell him and he&#8217;ll just shake his head like he doesn&#8217;t understand me and I&#8217;m like THAT&#8217;S RIGHT YOU DON&#8217;T.</p>\n<p>Jenny understands me though. And so does Sophie Scaife.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the official synopsis of <em>The Girlfriend</em>:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>Unemployed, blacklisted, and pregnant, Sophie Scaife\u2019s life is totally upside down. Her relationship with publishing magnate Neil Elwood is on the rocks. Her best friend\u2019s career is igniting. And Sophie is afraid she\u2019ll make one of the toughest decisions of her life alone\u2026 </em></p>\n<p><em>When a devastating diagnosis forces Neil to return to London, Sophie throws caution to the wind to follow her heart across the Atlantic. Keeping a scorching D/s affair as red-hot in sickness as it was in health is a challenge, even for two lovers as inventive as Sophie and Neil. But Sophie is more than willing to try anything her Sir commands, and their fantasies of control become a welcome refuge from the daily stress of illness. </em></p>\n<p><em>While Neil\u2019s wealth and privilege make adjusting to her new situation easier, Sophie finds herself rebuilding her life around an uncertain future. And while both of them face the changes between them head-on, they\u2019re all too aware that their happiness could be fleeting\u2014and Sophie could lose Neil forever.</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>So I guess you kind of have to read <em>The Boss</em> now, huh?</p>\n<p><strong>If you&#8217;re looking to pick up some new BDSM erotica to wash the horrible taste of <em>Fifty Shades&#8217;</em> popularity out of your brain, I <em>highly</em> recommend Abigail Barnette&#8217;s feminist response to it. </strong>(Yes, a BDSM erotic romance where the heroine is a feminist AND a sub.

Today has a hint of bitter to it.</p>\n<p>Three years ago in August, my Oma died, just shy of her 93rd birthday. Today she would have been 96.</p>\n<p>And for some reason today it&#8217;s hitting me hard. The first year was hard, of course; we&#8217;d just lost her after 4 years of prolonged illness and suffering, during which she&#8217;d gone to the brink and come back so many times we didn&#8217;t know how to grieve any more. After she died it didn&#8217;t hit me until Thanksgiving: we visited Opa and I just kept expecting her to wander down the hallway, talking about how wonderful the food her daughter had cooked smelled.</p>\n<p>She didn&#8217;t, and that&#8217;s when I sort of really realized she was dead.</p>\n<p>Grieving came in fits and spurts. Mostly I was fine, but then a day would come where I would be non-functional and weepy all day because I just missed my mom&#8217;s mom so much.</p>\n<p>Eventually the time between those days stretched, and I came to a point in my life where I wasn&#8217;t grieving anymore. I missed her, but I was no longer incredibly sad. I knew she was fine, wherever she was, and I was fine too.</p>\n<p>Until today.</p>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s because Ogre and I have set the date for our wedding &#8212; two years and a month, roughly, from today &#8212; and now that I&#8217;m starting to gather the disparate threads of wedding ideas into actual <em>planning</em>&#8230;it&#8217;s hitting me that Oma won&#8217;t be there to see me marry Ogre. It&#8217;s hitting me that she never met Ogre &#8212; I met him right after she died &#8212; so I don&#8217;t even know what she would have thought of him. (Opa and my Uncle were happy to see I&#8217;d finally met a good man.)</p>\n<p>And there&#8217;s more to it &#8212; I&#8217;m actually graduating in January. Finally, with my Bachelor&#8217;s, after 10 years of work at it. I&#8217;ll be walking across the stage in a silly hat and really warm polyester robe and I&#8217;ll be getting the piece of paper that makes those ten years of torture worth it.</p>\n<p>Those were the two things I always wanted her to see. My graduation and my wedding. Even when I wasn&#8217;t planning on getting married, I had this vague thought that <em>if</em> I met someone I wanted to do the whole wedding and marriage thing with, I would want her there.</p>\n<p>So today I&#8217;ve thought of ways I can honor her spirit at those events.<a href=\"http://offbeatbride.com/2013/05/wedding-day-memorials\"> There are already ideas out there for honoring your Beloved Dead at wedding ceremonies.</a> For graduation, it&#8217;s customary to go out to a meal afterwards, in celebration (I think). Even if this meal ends up being a sit-down at Wendy&#8217;s because we can&#8217;t afford anything else, I&#8217;m going to set a place for Oma.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, music gets me through the oh so bittersweet day.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<pre>'course numb is an old hat\nold as my oldest memories\nsee that one's my mother\nand that one's my father\nand that one in the hat, that's me\nit's a skill i'd hoped to abandon \nwhen i got out on the open road \nbut any more pent up emotion \nand i think i'm gonna explode</pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:right;\">&#8211;<a href=\"http://www.danah.org/Ani/KnuckleDown/StudyingStones.html\"><em>Studying Stones</em>, Ani DiFranco, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Knuckle Down</span></a></p>\n", "post_id": 4028, "location": false, "date": "09-11-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["stories: Stranger Skies", "goddesses", "giveaways", "pagan feminist literary fiction", "cover reveals", "books", "wolves"], "text": "<p>It&#8217;s here!

Should she strive to regain her godhood or accept her mortality and find love?</p>\n<p>Silva, Queen of Wolves, Lady of the True Woods, seeks her only friend Etan, who, along with other deities of the Council of Divinity, has gone missing for reasons unknown. Her search traps her on a world where the wolves have lost faith in her; she becomes a mortal woman whose remaining powers could brand her as a witch.</p>\n<p>Through the chaos of war and the turmoil in her own heart, Silva can&#8217;t escape a persistent feeling: that her fall was not an accident.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Excerpt</strong>Heart\u2019s Blood Tavern had indoor plumbing which, according to Scoas, made it a rare building in the town. The toilets were composting toilets, however, and so the scent of human waste combined with peat overwhelmed Silva\u2019s sensitive nose. She entered the stall and did her business quickly, trying to ignore the pong of the room. There was one sink and a small mirror of that same polished stone \u2014 while she washed her hands, she noticed she was more fleshed out than she had been the day before. Minae food worked quickly.</p>\n<p>She turned to leave, and then stopped dead, horror making her veins run ice cold. Above the door was another animal head as \u2018decor\u2019.</p>\n<p>Its muzzle was posed open in a silent snarl, its ears were flat back on its head, and it was made to look vicious around the eye\u2019s epicanthic folds \u2014 but this was all a lie. She reached her hand up to touch the soft fur, but it was too high up, and she couldn\u2019t reach.</p>\n<p>She\u2019d found her first Minae wolf.</p>\n<p>The scent of fear and death hit her then; it had been masked before, but now that she gazed upon the source it was so clear she reeled. She ran back into the stall and vomited what was left of that morning\u2019s breakfast.</p>\n<p>This wolf had died in fear and pain, and she hadn\u2019t been here to help.</p>\n<p>She hadn\u2019t been able to help so many of her children on Terra, too. The mortal humans had shot them from planes, poisoned them, hunted them near to extinction. The only thing that had saved them from that fate had been constant fighting \u2014 from Silva herself, and her one or two human followers. Mortals who lived with wolf-hybrids and knew about her existence, and who wanted to help save her children. Silva had petitioned the Twins to save her cubs, and they had finally listened and moved all the wolves off-planet. She didn\u2019t think they would have had it not been for the strengthening arguments of a few other gods who had a soft spot for wolves \u2014 the Morrigan, Hecate, and Odin were the big three who had argued on Silva\u2019s side. She wasn\u2019t sure if she\u2019d ever properly expressed her gratitude to those deities.</p>\n<p>On Tau Ceti, the wolves had been placed far enough away from human settlements so as to be relatively safe. But when humans expanded outwards, as they invariably did?</p>\n<p>If she never got home, the Cetian wolves might meet the same fate. And this time she wouldn\u2019t be around to stop them from going extinct completely.</p>\n<p>She shook with helplessness and fear. There was nothing she could do. She was trapped here in mortal form, and her children might all die. The thought made her sick again.</p>\n<p>When finally she exited the bathroom, after having rinsed her mouth thoroughly, she felt scrubbed out, hollowed, empty. A gourd left in the rain after All Hallows Eve; burned on the inside, destined for the compost heap to rot away in ignominy.</p>\n<p>She tried to hide her distress when she got back to the table. Their food had arrived by that point, and a man she\u2019d never seen before stood beside the table and chatted with Scoas and Natai, and occasionally giving Brinna a predatory smile. Brinna seemed less than pleased with the man\u2019s attentions, but she was unfailingly polite.</p>\n<p>Silva instantly disliked the man. He smelled <em>wrong</em>, and his bearing positively screamed his arrogance.</p>\n<p>Scoas noticed Silva\u2019s return, then, and made introductions before Silva could escape.</p>\n<p>The man\u2019s name was Kaz, and he gave Silva an exceptionally oily smile. He was a hunter \u2014 the best in Heartpin, apparently. \u201cYou must have seen my prize trophy,\u201d he said to her, folding his arms over his chest. Silva politely raised her eyebrows even as her stomach churned with dread. \u201cThe wolf\u2019s head hanging in the privy. Got that bastard over a year ago. Scoas bought the pelt.\u201d</p>\n<p>Silva felt like fainting. She barely heard what Scoas said: \u201cIt\u2019s a very nice pelt, too; we simply love it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a secret to get the best pelts, Scoas my man,\u201d Kaz said, winking at Scoas. \u201cWould you like to know it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Silva said, brushing past Kaz and heading for the door. She knew the secret for the best pelts, and if she heard Kaz tell them exactly how he\u2019d tortured the young wolf whose head hung in the bathroom, she might kill him right there in the tavern.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">~~~~~~~~~~~</p>\n<p><strong>Giveaway!</strong><a class=\"rafl\" id=\"rc-e6625d1\" href=\"http://www.rafflecopter.com/rafl/display/e6625d1/\" rel=\"nofollow\">a Rafflecopter giveaway</a></p>\n", "post_id": 4033, "location": false, "date": "09-13-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["FMS Photo a Day"], "text": "<div style=\"margin:0 0 10px;padding:0;font-size:.8em;line-height:1.6em;\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/katjevanloon/9733037045/\" title=\"Sept 12: Shadow. #fmsphotoaday\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/farm8.staticflickr.com/7330/9733037045_684665d3a3.jpg\" alt=\"Sept 12: Shadow. #fmsphotoaday by Katje van Loon\" /></a><br /><span style=\"margin:0;\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/katjevanloon/9733037045/\">Sept 12: Shadow. #fmsphotoaday</a>, a photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/katjevanloon/\">Katje van Loon</a> on Flickr.</span></div></p>\n", "post_id": 4040, "location": false, "date": "09-13-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["loved ones", "family", "Mr. Katje", "personal", "food and drink", "fat", "friends", "eating disorders"], "text": "<h4>Content warning: disordered eating, fatphobia, misogynistic language, description of child abuse</h4>\n<p>Note: this is written based on my own personal experience with relatives, friends, loved ones, and my eating disorders. Other people may have different eating disorders and different experiences, and my post is in now way trying to speak for them. It&#8217;s just me venting about stuff that I go through every day.</p>\n<p>My eating disorders are, for clarity, binge/emotional eating and anorexia. Eating is a complete MINEFIELD for me before we even factor in other people&#8217;s comments, reactions, etc, because I am constantly fighting a battle with myself about what food I &#8220;should&#8221; or &#8220;shouldn&#8217;t&#8221; eat. If I binge eat because I&#8217;m upset, I then spend several days starving myself because I&#8217;m full of self-loathing. But as I know stopping myself from eating is bad, I then force myself to eat, and feel horrible about it.</p>\n<p>So here are the things that are said/done, quite often, either to or around me that DON&#8217;T HELP AT ALL.</p>\n<h3>&#8220;This is so bad for me; it&#8217;s got, like, 100 more calories than I&#8217;m supposed to have in one serving.&#8221;</h3>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the thing. When I buy food, I can&#8217;t even look at the &#8220;nutritional&#8221; information on the back of the food I&#8217;m thinking of purchasing, because the second I look at the calories per serving bit, my brain starts telling me it&#8217;s too much, I should put it back, in fact I&#8217;m such a huge fucking cow that I should stop eating because I don&#8217;t deserve to have any food. If I&#8217;m already having a bad day, mental health wise, looking at the calorie count while grocery shopping can reduce me to tears and have me leaving the grocery store without any food, going home hungry, and curling up in my bed because sleeping doesn&#8217;t take that much energy.</p>\n<p>Secondly, something having a lot of calories doesn&#8217;t make it bad for you. This is pure bullshit that has no basis in reality or actual nutritional fact, and it&#8217;s pumped out by the fatphobic diet-industrial complex that so many people are complete slaves to. So no, it&#8217;s not bad for you because it had 100 more calories than some arbitrary rule says you should have in one serving. It&#8217;s bad for you because it&#8217;s got wheat and you&#8217;re fucking gluten-intolerant. Or it&#8217;s not bad for you <em>at all</em>, and you&#8217;re just running your mouth off about how something&#8217;s bad for you because you desperately want other people to hold you accountable for your &#8220;diet&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Look, your diet is your own goddamn responsibility, and it&#8217;s not up to me or any other relatives or friends or loved ones to hold you to it. If you are so desperate to lose weight that you&#8217;re going to cut your calories and exercise more in pursuit of the almighty low number on the scale, to the extent of ignoring actual health or nutrition, fine. Have at.

You <em>reminding</em> me that <strong>my brain tells me <em>all</em> food is bad for me because I don&#8217;t deserve it</strong> is not making my dinner enjoyable.</p>\n<h3>&#8220;Are you sure you really <em>need</em> that cupcake/brownie/cookie/spoonful of Nutella?&#8221;</h3>\n<p>My instant response to this is &#8220;Are you sure you don&#8217;t really <em>need</em> a good punch in the face?&#8221; But I refrain from saying it, because <em>I</em> was raised to have some fucking manners.</p>\n<p><strong>It is not your business what I eat.</strong> At all. Ever. No exceptions to this rule. Whether I&#8217;m having Nutella for lunch or it&#8217;s the first goddamn sweet I&#8217;ve had all week &#8212; it&#8217;s not your business.</p>\n<p>I literally have to put stickers <em>all</em> over my kitchen that have little affirmation sayings, like &#8220;You always make the right food choices for you,&#8221; and &#8220;You are allowed to eat whatever you wish,&#8221; to counteract the constant refrain of <em>YOU DON&#8217;T DESERVE ANYTHING YOU FAT CUNT</em> that screams itself through my brain on a daily basis. Cooking is painful for me, because in the time it takes me to make my pork chop and veggies or pasta or fucking ramen, I&#8217;m going over all the reasons whatever I&#8217;m cooking is bad for me because it&#8217;s got calories, <em>period,</em> and how I should just stop eating altogether. Cooking for one? It&#8217;s a goddamned nightmare.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_3612\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-3612\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/katjevanloon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/BranMuffinBakingFeb1013_filtered_001-1024x767.jpg\" alt=\"Baked bran muffins in four tins.\" width=\"640\" height=\"479\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Muffins I made for the Ogre.</p></div>\n<p>I love cooking for other people, because then I can shut up the voices &#8212; I&#8217;m making the food for someone else.

It&#8217;s because <strong>the tightrope I have to walk between caring about my physical health and caring about my mental health is thin as fuck and razor sharp, and it makes my feet bleed as I canvas the cruel earth, trying desperately not to fall apart too much on any one side, lest I lose it all.</strong></p>\n<p>Making comments about my food choices is not only a dick move, it&#8217;s just plain <em>rude </em>&#8211; regardless of whether your target has eating disorders or not.

Maybe your one meal a day is really big and actually is enough to keep you going, or you&#8217;re having lots of little snacks throughout the day and just one &#8220;formal&#8221; meal. But a statement like this sends up a million red flags for me as well as triggering me all to fucking hell.</p>\n<p>I go quiet, because I don&#8217;t quite know what to say. I don&#8217;t know how to say your statement has sent up red flags for me, because I know exactly what it&#8217;s like to be on the receiving end of those sorts of expressions of concern. We don&#8217;t always listen. I don&#8217;t know how to say your statement about feeling virtuous because you might be starving yourself is triggering the constant stream of hatethoughts in my brain, telling me I&#8217;m NOT virtuous, because I eat more than one meal, and snack a lot besides.</p>\n<p>Experience tells me that if you&#8217;re really serious about hurting yourself, you don&#8217;t tell other people. You get good at hiding your disorder. So I don&#8217;t actually know if your statement is a cry for help, or just a misguided expression of &#8220;I&#8217;m doing so well on my diet.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If it&#8217;s the former, please seek help. Professional help. I can offer solidarity fistbumps, but only if you&#8217;re actively fighting against your disorder.</p>\n<p>If it&#8217;s the latter, stop. Stop stop <strong><em>stop.</em></strong> As noted already, I don&#8217;t want to hear about your diet. I really really don&#8217;t. And talking about it this way is the worst possible way to do so &#8212; you are actively telling me that I&#8217;m not virtuous because I&#8217;m eating. Because I&#8217;m fighting my disorder. I know you don&#8217;t mean to tell me that. But it&#8217;s what your words say to me; it&#8217;s all I hear.</p>\n<p>So stop.</p>\n<h3>&#8220;I saw an old picture of you and you were MUCH skinnier!&#8221;</h3>\n<p>Usually said with a sort of &#8220;Ah ah ah, what a bad person you are, gaining weight!&#8221; tone, and followed up with questions about what you&#8217;re doing to lose weight.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Seriously?</strong> </em>I mean, I&#8217;ve actually heard this said about my fianc\u00e9. He brushed it off, but I was LIVID. Who the FUCK thinks it&#8217;s okay to say shit like this? To anyone? I don&#8217;t give a shit if you&#8217;re family; you don&#8217;t get to say that stuff to people.</p>\n<p>Saying this reminds me that I&#8217;m fat, my fianc\u00e9&#8217;s fat, and you know what? <strong>We don&#8217;t need the reminder.</strong> It&#8217;s&#8230;kind of glaringly obvious, and seeing as <em>we&#8217;re</em> the ones who have to deal with <em>our own bodies</em> every single day and not, you know, <em>you,</em> maybe you should shut the fuck up?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_3998\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-3998\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/katjevanloon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/20130904_231841_Anne_Vignette_Intertwined-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Wait...I'm FAT?

How will I EVER survive it without DYING?</p></div>\n<p>Hey, you know what&#8217;s fun? When people make me feel like shit over how much I&#8217;m eating. Really. Because I&#8217;m not already doing that inside my own head, so it&#8217;s really nice when people ask me how I could POSSIBLY be eating so much because they&#8217;d just DIE if they ate THAT MUCH FOOD oh my GODS it&#8217;s SO MUCH GUYS.</p>\n<p>Ok, I get it &#8212; you don&#8217;t need as much food as I do. What you may not get is often, this is my first meal of the day, or my first chance in the week to actually eat my fill. I don&#8217;t eat that much during the week. Not by choice; I&#8217;m often quite hungry. But money is tight, and food is expensive. So when I head over to my fianc\u00e9&#8217;s house for the weekend, I tend to eat more &#8212; because he has all the food. We don&#8217;t live together yet. I have to wait till the weekend to eat food he buys. During the week, I rely on my own money to eat food &#8212; and there&#8217;s just not enough right now. My rent is way too high.</p>\n<p>And he&#8217;s fine with it! And he realizes that I&#8217;ll probably be eating smaller meals, more often, when we live together. But for right now, the weekend is when I get to <em>actually have some goddamn food</em> and not feel hungry all the time.</p>\n<p>So when we&#8217;re out to dinner and my fianc\u00e9 and I get big plates of food, maybe you should, you know, NOT comment on HOW MUCH IT IS OH MY GODS and how you would just DIE with that much food (seriously, have you never heard of <strong>doggy bags?</strong>). A, it&#8217;s rude. B, you&#8217;re making me feel like shit and lose my appetite.</p>\n<h3>&#8220;I stole a bit off your plate, I hope you don&#8217;t mind! You&#8217;re not eating <em>all</em> those fries anyway, right?&#8221;</h3>\n<p><strong>If you do this to me you will get stabbed</strong>. Seriously. I have stabbed people with forks before.</p>\n<p>I spent my childhood having to wolf down my food so fast I nearly choked because <strong>if I didn&#8217;t eat it fast enough, my biological sire would steal it off my plate.</strong> Often he&#8217;d take me out to Dairy Queen and tell me to get any Blizzard I wanted. <em>Wow,</em> I&#8217;d think, <em>what a treat!</em></p>\n<p>And then he&#8217;d take it from me before I was done with a quarter of it and say &#8220;You don&#8217;t need this, you&#8217;re getting fat,&#8221; and eat the whole thing in front of me.</p>\n<p>I used to tell him I needed money for pads and exaggerate how much they cost. I&#8217;d then buy Oreos with the extra cash, which I&#8217;d hide in my underwear drawer and cram down my mouth whenever I was upset. Which was often, at his house; if he wasn&#8217;t abusing me emotionally, he was doing so physically.</p>\n<p>He never listened to my food preferences.<strong> I&#8217;ve lost count of the number of times he held my head and shoved food I hated down my throat, like I was a <em>dog</em> who wouldn&#8217;t take her meds.</strong> Once he told me that if I didn&#8217;t eat my squash, I could sit at the table all night. I was determined to do so, and I sat there for several hours after dinner, even though I really needed to pee. But I didn&#8217;t dare get up, because if he caught me he&#8217;d hit me.</p>\n<p>My step-siblings came in from swimming in the pool, like you do when you&#8217;re upper-middle-class and don&#8217;t have to worry about your lights being cut off because your father refuses to pay child support, and tried to convince me to throw the squash in the compost and just tell dad I&#8217;d eaten it. I refused, because I knew he would find out. They did it for me and left the room. When dad came back in, I told him I&#8217;d eaten the squash, not daring to hope it&#8217;d worked.</p>\n<p>It didn&#8217;t. He&#8217;d been in the other room, had heard every word. He took it out of the compost, covered in old coffee grinds and other organic waste, and force-fed it to me.</p>\n<p>Whenever I <em>did</em> get food I liked, he would take it from me if I didn&#8217;t eat it fast enough for him.</p>\n<p><strong>He topped this all off by screaming at me that my <em>horrible</em> mother and grandmother were &#8220;making me fat&#8221;. Because, you know, they actually treated me like a fucking <em>human being</em> when it came to feeding me.</strong></p>\n<p>So when we&#8217;re out to dinner and you reach for my food and I say, &#8220;Don&#8217;t do that,&#8221; and my voice is a little loud and wavery, and I seem upset? It&#8217;s because you just triggered my eating disorders; you just gave me flashbacks to my childhood.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_4052\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-4052\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/katjevanloon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/20121020_005351-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"This. is.

Even then, it&#8217;s always best to ask. It&#8217;s rude to take food off someone&#8217;s plate without asking.)</p>\n<h3><em>&#8220;That&#8217;s</em> your comfort food? That&#8217;s not really healthy for you, you know.&#8221;</h3>\n<p>Shut up. You&#8217;re not my doctor or my nutritionist. You&#8217;re not me. You have NO IDEA what is healthy for me or not. You do not get to make snap judgements on what is healthy for me or not based off what YOU believe about nutrition (which may be horribly wrong, especially if you got your info from, oh, society at large, which is fatphobic and stupid when it comes to the truth about eating and food &#8212; ie, see points I already covered).</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_4054\" style=\"width: 622px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-4054\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/katjevanloon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2012-09-24_1348495061.jpg\" alt=\"Comfort latte!

Writing this brought up some very horrible memories and feelings for me, and I can&#8217;t put any more of my time into delving into that pain for this.</p>\n<p>If something I&#8217;ve said in this post makes you angry and spluttery and you feel the need to take to the comments with a &#8220;But I only say these things because I CAAAARRRREEEEEEEEEEEEE&#8221;, or any other excuse-making bullshit that people are quick to pull out when you call them on their behaviour, I urge you to take some time to self-reflect and consider that, just maybe, the correct response to someone saying &#8220;Hey, you&#8217;ve stepped on my toes&#8221; is <strong>not,</strong> in fact, &#8220;FUCK YOU FOR HAVING TOES.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Thanks, and good night.</p>\n<p>-Kat</p>\n", "post_id": 4042, "location": false, "date": "09-18-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["How to Keep a Human", "writing life", "stories: Stranger Skies", "pre-order info", "Kaimana Wolff"], "text": "<p><a href=\"https://gumroad.com/l/strangerskies\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-4035 alignright\" alt=\"Art by Autumn Skye Morrison.\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/katjevanloon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/StrangerSkiesebookcoverPress-200x300.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<p>Hey, so, if you didn&#8217;t win the giveaway, you can now pre-order the actual book from Gumroad!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong><a href=\"https://gumroad.com/l/strangerskies\">Click here to pre-order. </a></strong></span></p>\n<p>I am also working on setting up a pre-order for the ebook bundle via another service so people without credit cards can get it, but it&#8217;s turning out to be a bit more complicated than I thought. It may, indeed, not happen for this book. Sorry, but I&#8217;m really swamped, and apparently not technically savvy enough to figure this particular thing out.</p>\n<p>On the plus side, as soon as the release date rolls around (October 4th), you&#8217;ll be able to get a copy of the book from Kobo, Amazon, the Kat and Wolff e-junkie store, and Tomely! (And Gumroad, of course, and maybe some other places!)</p>\n<p>If you do have a credit card, though, you want to get the pre-order &#8212; because I&#8217;ll be sending you a little something extra along with the ebook bundle. If you pre-order, you&#8217;ll also get a full copy of the story &#8220;The Murine Invasions&#8221; from <a href=\"http://kaimanawolff.com/\">Kaimana Wolff</a>&#8216;s <a href=\"http://starsabovestarsbelow.wordpress.com/fiction/true-woods-tales/how-to-keep-a-human/\"><em>How to Keep a Human</em></a>.</p>\n<p>The regular <em>Stranger Skies</em> ebook will have a small teaser for <em>How to Keep a Human</em> at the back, but it won&#8217;t be a complete story.</p>\n<p>Why am I including a story from Wolff&#8217;s book? Because the main character of <em>Stranger Skies</em> is based off a character in Wolff&#8217;s book, and both stories take place in the loose universe (the universe of the True Woods). I talked to Kaimana about doing some cross-promotion with our stories and she thought it was a great idea, so if you pre-order you get a copy of &#8220;The Murine Invasions&#8221;.</p>\n<p>(The copy will be sent to all pre-order customers separately from the main file you&#8217;ll get from Gumroad, and it&#8217;ll happen after book release.)</p>\n<p>And now, I am getting back to work on the big publishing order we&#8217;re putting out.</p>\n<p>Winners of the giveaway, check your emails if you haven&#8217;t already!</p>\n", "post_id": 4061, "location": false, "date": "09-22-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["stories: Stranger Skies", "Angel", "Literature", "Powell River", "Kat and Wolff", "poetry", "rain", "international peace poem", "pluviophilia", "writing life", "books", "Vancouver", "Buffy the Vampire Slayer", "Canadianism", "local", "WORD Vancouver", "Kaimana Wolff"], "text": "<p>Well, actually, even <em>I</em> find this weather kind of frightening.

Mainly by watching <em>Angel</em> and <em>Buffy</em> on Netflix. Don&#8217;t judge me. I never got to see them in the order they aired (I watched <em>Angel</em> before <em>Buffy</em> and marathon-ed both shows) so I&#8217;m re-watching them in order.

The takeaway from this is that my sleep schedule has been borked. Again.</p>\n<p>So, natch, I&#8217;m pulling an all-nighter to right it. I have my first volunteer day for <a href=\"http://www.writersfest.bc.ca/\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">VIWF</span></a> on Thursday. 10 am, Granville Island. I&#8217;ll need an hour to drive out there and an hour to get ready in the morning, and I like being early. No time to slowly fix the sleep schedule over 2 weeks, unfortunately. Need to do an urgent patch.</p>\n<p>Waking up at 6pm meant I was almost too late for the <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><a href=\"http://www.vancouverpoetryhouse.com/vanslam/\">VanSlam</a></span>. Luckily, I got in just under the wire and even got to perform. (!!!) I read <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><a href=\"http://katjewrites.wordpress.com/2013/10/08/blood-candle/\">&#8220;Blood Candle&#8221;</a></span>, a poem I wrote a yearish ago and have been sitting on ever since. Video was taken; it will be up at some point in the next week or so, I gather. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;ll be a full body shot, so you won&#8217;t be able to see the horrendous shaking of my legs. It felt like I was trying to tap-dance.</p>\n<p>After Slam I got to hang out with my fabulous friend D., who stepped into the boots of Bellica Yarrow for the cover of <em>Bellica.</em> Yes, that&#8217;s a photograph on the cover; everyone is always so surprised with that info. We chatted and she showed me <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/MyHarto?feature=watch\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">My Drunk Kitchen</span></a>. I was reminded that I needed to get back to vlogging, so expect to see a video sometime soon. Then I went home at like 2:30 a.m., which is obviously the best time to make the drive from East Van to Coquitlam.</p>\n<p>Side note, I just got up in the middle of writing this to go find my video camera. I knew exactly where it was. What I did not realize was that the purple bra I have been looking for was hiding with it. So, hooray. I found my video camera AND my bra. Perhaps in celebration of this fact I shall wear my bra as a hat during my vlog. Also I will stop typing <em>bray</em> instead of <em>bra,</em> forcing myself to constantly delete and fix.</p>\n<p>Unrelated to any of this, I am trying to cut sugar out of my diet. This has nothing to do with &#8220;eating healthy&#8221; or whatever the fuck and everything to do with <em>my wisdom teeth are coming in everything is inflamed sugar makes this worse ow ow ow ow ow please kill me now.</em> Actually, eating <em>anything</em> hurts right now, but sugar is definitely the biggest culprit in worsening my pain levels to the point of &#8220;I cannot function, please send copious amounts of alcohol and then leave me to curl up in the snow and die&#8221;. Working on seeing a dentist soon. At this point, I&#8217;m hoping the teeth are impacted &#8212; because in Canada if you need actual surgery to get out wisdom teeth (ie, if they&#8217;re impacted), it will be partially or maybe totally covered by healthcare. Or if your teeth have gotten to emergency levels, ie you&#8217;ll die without treatment &#8212; then you&#8217;re covered too. So, you know, that&#8217;s completely not at all fucked up in any way. Right? Right.</p>\n<p>Anyway, the cutting sugar totally out is not easy and I have been failing miserably. I don&#8217;t even eat that much sugar these days, at least not during the week when I&#8217;m at my place (there&#8217;s a lot of junk food at Ogre&#8217;s place, and I have no will power) and still I&#8217;m finding it really difficult. I need coffee in the morning, and I really do prefer it sweet. I use honey or agave syrup because white sugar, blech, but that doesn&#8217;t matter to my inflamed gums and nerves. Sugar is sugar I guess.</p>\n<p>Long story short I&#8217;m not sure how to end this blog post so I just keep rambling about things.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "post_id": 4169, "location": false, "date": "10-08-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["feminist poetry", "reproductive justice", "Rona Ambrose", "abortion", "poetry", "m312", "Vancouver", "politics", "reproductive rights", "poetry slam", "VanSlam", "local", "feminism"], "text": "<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='560' height='315' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/u3VNWpTBj8k?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span>\n<p>This is me at the VanSlam on Monday night.

It&#8217;s been a while!</p>\n<p>I have technically finished the first draft of <em>Jade Star</em>, but as <em>revisions</em> with this book means &#8220;add a few thousand words&#8221;, it&#8217;s still a WiP.</p>\n<p>Spoilers for <em>Bellica</em> ahead.</p>\n<p>This snippet is from Ghia&#8217;s point of view, and it&#8217;s her speaking.

Cue word is <em>nails;</em> the snippet contains <em>fingernails.</em> (The only instance of <em>nails</em> in the entire manuscript so far.)</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong>, for context: Ghia is part Magi, part Terran. The Magi are one of the original species of the planet Zarqon, and they were a race of psychics. When one Magi, or part-Magi, dies, all the ones who still live feel it. Ghia has already felt two part-Magi deaths in her life. The closer, emotionally, the Magi are, the more the death hurts the one who still lives. Furthermore, each Magi is bound to an element &#8212; earth, air, fire, water, light/sun, dark/moons &#8212; and that is directly related to <em>what</em> the living Magi feel when one dies. The death of a water-bound Magi, for example, would likely feel like one was drowning.</p>\n<p>Rosa, Ghia&#8217;s great-great-great-great-etc-grand-aunt and mentor, and an earth-bound (Corasin) Magi, has left on a mission a few days before. Ghia has just felt what she thinks is the death of a Magi, which resulted in her having a screaming fit and then fainting. She&#8217;s awake now, and is talking to her spouse about what she felt.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t feel the earth leaving, or burying me under a mountain of grief, as I did when Molly died,\u201d she said, almost matter-of-factly. \u201cI should have. Instead it was\u2026it was as if the sun had left the sky, and the world was plunged into darkness forevermore. As if Umbra had won,\u201d she whispered, shuddering at the memory of that fight against the dark goddess. She shook her head, trying to clear it. \u201cEven now I don\u2019t feel as if Rosa\u2019s totally gone, which by rights I should.\u201d She tapped her fingernails against her teeth, thinking. <strong>Something</strong> had happened, and it had definitely involved Rosa. That was the only thing of which she was sure.</p>\n<p>That, and that she had to tell Queen Yarrow.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Hope you enjoyed the snippet!

There isn&#8217;t even enough of the virus present in the books for anyone to contract it from touching them; just enough present for it to test positive.</p>\n<p>This has inspired a large wave of <em>ew, gross, herpes</em>, and <em>I guess it really IS a dirty book lol</em> from not only the people reporting this news but, well, everyone else. So far most, if not all, of the reactions I&#8217;ve seen have had hefty doses of shaming thrown in.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll admit, when I first heard it, I raised an eyebrow and thought<em> I think I don&#8217;t want to know <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">how</span> those books got herpes</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>But I dismissed that thought pretty quickly</strong>. The fact is, you don&#8217;t <em>have</em> to hump a book to give it herpes. Herpes simplex isn&#8217;t <em>just</em> an STI; it&#8217;s the same virus that gives you cold sores. Viral shedding can occur at any time, and in more areas than just the genitals. It may be asymptomatic. <em>Fifty Shades of Grey</em> getting herpes likely has little to do with the book&#8217;s content and more to do with how common herpes is and how popular the books are.</p>\n<p>I am not an expert on herpes. I&#8217;m just someone who knows people who have it. I&#8217;m also someone who was researching STIs about 7 years before I was having sex. (Insert <em>I&#8217;m sort of Ravenclaw even though I&#8217;m Slytherin</em> joke here.)</p>\n<p>The shaming reactions to this news have saddened me.</p>\n<p>Having herpes or any other STI doesn&#8217;t make you a monster, or <em>diseased,</em> or <em>dirty</em> or <em>unclean.</em> It just means you contracted something. That something may have no cure as of yet (herpes, AIDS), or it may just need a trip to the doctor and a prescription to get it cleared up (syphilis). It may be easy to live with, or it may be hard. STIs are a part of life. Even, sometimes, for people who aren&#8217;t having sex. Contracting an\u00a0 STI does not mean you are undeserving of love or basic human decency.</p>\n<p><strong>I hate <em>Fifty Shades of Grey</em> with an all-consuming passion, but I don&#8217;t condone the way people have been talking about this.</strong> <em>Fifty Shades of Grey</em> testing positive for herpes does not make it a terrible book (the fact that it&#8217;s a terrible book makes it a terrible book), and when you say it does you are indirectly saying that people who have herpes are terrible people.</p>\n<p>Criticize <em>Fifty Shades</em> for its shoddy writing, for its depiction of an abusive relationship as romance, for its utter lack of plot or meaningful characterization, for its rape apologism, for its plagiarism, for its absolute lack of truthfulness in depicting BDSM and promoting of dangerous BDSM practices, for its message of &#8220;EWWWWW, POOR PEOPLE&#8221;. Those are all <em>fair</em> criticisms.</p>\n<p>Criticizing the book because library copies happened to test positive for herpes is not fair, and has nothing to do with the book itself. Herpes was also found on <em>Tango</em> by Pieter Aspe, and yet you don&#8217;t hear people making shaming comments about <em>that.</em> Somehow, because<em> Fifty Shades</em> is about a subject many people find taboo, it&#8217;s fair game?</p>\n<p>No. It&#8217;s not. Stop shaming folks who read erotica, period, and stop with the sex-negative, STI-shaming surrounding this news story. It&#8217;s boring. As boring as the sex scenes in<em> Fifty Shades of Grey.</em></p>\n", "post_id": 4221, "location": false, "date": "11-18-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["books", "events", "stories: Stranger Skies", "fiction"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://katjevanloon.com/the-borderlands-saga/\"><img class=\"alignright\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/katjevanloon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/StrangerSkiesebookcoverPress.jpg\" width=\"324\" height=\"486\" /></a>My book launch for <em>Stranger Skies</em> is supposed to be this Sunday, the 24th of November, at the Cottage Bistro in Vancouver.

Regardless, it never happened.)</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_4317\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-4317 \" alt=\"A page from my planner during the time I ran a cafe. Filled with copious notes.\" src=\"https://amoebakat.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/img_0582.jpg?w=300&#038;h=206\" width=\"300\" height=\"206\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Two pages from my planner during that time. It&#8217;s a lot of work.</p></div>\n<p>Part of my job in the pre-opening stages was deciding on what coffee we would serve. (I should say, this wasn&#8217;t really a <em>restaurant;</em> it was a caf\u00e9, with plans of food, coffee, live entertainment, books, and vintage furniture&#8230;exactly my type of place.) First, we went around town and sampled the competition, to see what we were up against. It was not stiff. If you want a decent cup of coffee in Powell River, your only bet is Breakwater Books. They scored an 8 out of 10 on our rating scale. Starbucks was a close second, scoring a 6. All the other coffee places didn&#8217;t even make a 5.</p>\n<p>So I wanted to go with Salt Spring Coffee. They were local, which was important to me, and they were no doubt far better quality than the coffees mainly available in town. Most caf\u00e9s in Powell River go through the same supplier.</p>\n<p>The person I chatted with at Salt Spring, <a href=\"http://www.saltspringcoffee.com/our-people/kevin-burk/\">Kevin Burk</a>, was amazing, and it makes me sad that the caf\u00e9 never got off the ground, because I would have loved to continue having a professional relationship with him. He sent me a box of sample coffee. Not just tiny bags &#8212; full bags of Salt Spring coffee, so I and my team could try them and decide if Salt Spring was the way we wanted to go.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.saltspringcoffee.com/shop/decaf-coffee/\">Included in that, of course, was decaf</a>, which we had to try. (The Peru single origin.) I had never had decaf in my life before; I was not looking forward to it. But I couldn&#8217;t make an informed decision without trying it, so I brewed up some in our French Press and gave it a whirl.</p>\n<p>To my ultimate amazement, it was quite good. It reminded me of, again, Turkish coffee.<strong> It certainly wasn&#8217;t something I&#8217;d choose to drink on a regular basis, but <em>this</em> decaf led me to wonder from where all the ire had originally come.</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, caffeine is amazing, and surely I cannot live without it. Yet I wonder how much of my good mood after a cup of coffee is attributable to the caffeine itself, and how much is psychosomatic? Does coffee put me in a better mood because of the chemicals, or does it put me in a better mood because it&#8217;s a comfort food for me?</p>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s a combination. I still drink decaf, after all. I have to, now. Before, when I was young and carefree and able to sleep anywhere, at the drop of a hat, I could drink eight cups of coffee and go to bed an hour later. (Not just in my teens, when caffeine apparently has different effects on your body, but in my early and mid-twenties, too.) Now, in my late twenties, if I have caffeine after noon I&#8217;m risking being up until 4 in the morning. If I drink decaf, I have a chance of actually sleeping. This is so important to a person with a as-of-yet-undiagnosed-but-definitely-real sleep disorder.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, I&#8217;m still in a good mood after a cup of decaf.</p>\n<p>I no longer agree with my fellow coffee snobs when they scream, pitchforks and torches in hand, <em>DEATH BEFORE DECAF</em>. Now my rallying cry is <em>I&#8217;D REALLY RATHER PREFER REGULAR COFFEE BUT DECAF BEFORE ANOTHER SLEEPLESS NIGHT, PLEASE</em>.</p>\n<p>It may lead to my getting kicked out of the clubhouse but I won&#8217;t waver on this. Decaf tastes fine to me, and that&#8217;s okay. If it doesn&#8217;t taste fine to you, that&#8217;s okay too. <strong>My approval of decaf coffee does not, so far as I&#8217;m concerned, revoke my Coffee Snob membership card, and you can pry it from my cold-because-I-haven&#8217;t-slept-in-three-days fingers.</strong> Because the second I give into peer pressure, I&#8217;m just another conformist douche incapable of forming an independent opinion and sticking to it. And I&#8217;d rather not have <em>that</em> be the only definition of <em>coffee snob</em>.</p>\n", "post_id": 4304, "location": false, "date": "11-22-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["abortions of filmmaking", "OH FUCK MY EYES", "Drakestail", "should be a law against bad movies"], "text": "<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>Favorite childhood book OR current favorite YA book (or both!)</strong></p>\n<p>My favorite book as a child was <em>Drakestail</em>, which is an old French folk tale. Mom would read it with me, and we&#8217;d sing out the repeating chorus of <em>Quack! Quack! Quack! When shall I get my money back?</em> together with great relish and glee. I especially liked that the duck was dating the river. Seemed rather apropos.</p>\n<p><em>The Golden Compass</em> is my current favorite YA book. I haven&#8217;t yet read the rest of the trilogy, but the first book is top notch. It is a response to <em>The Chronicles of Narnia</em> by C.S. Lewis and the not-so-subtle Christianity embedded in that story and world. (Seriously, re-reading it as an adult I&#8217;m like &#8220;Oh, so THAT&#8217;S where all those dominant Christian tropes in my brain that I&#8217;ve had to train myself out of came from! The obvious sexism in Narnia (&#8220;War is ugly when women fight!&#8221; um dude war is usually ugly, and tell that to the Morrigan JUST SAYIN), and that children&#8217;s Bible some neighbour gave to me when I was a kid which is honestly pretty creepy now that I think about it.&#8221; I mean, in general I don&#8217;t have a problem with Christianity OR <a href=\"http://katjevanloon.com/30-in-30-day%C2%A008-in-which-im-just-asking-for-some-hatemail/\">the Bible</a>, but there are very strong tropes of misogyny, racism, etc, within both book (especially when it&#8217;s been simplified for kids, like in my children&#8217;s Bible) and Church and it takes a thinking Christian to put aside the &#8220;This is how things <em>were</em> back then&#8221; and see it as an interesting look at history/a repository of facts, myth, religious meaning, etc. Like, it&#8217;s possible to read the Bible and take beauty and meaning from it and not hatred and bigotry (<em>especially</em> internalized self-hatred), just like it&#8217;s possible to be a Christian and not be racist/misogynist/classist/etc. I&#8217;ve seen it happen. Anyway, I digress.)</p>\n<p><em>The Golden Compass</em> isn&#8217;t exactly children&#8217;s fare (neither is Narnia, in my view, but that&#8217;s a different rant). The ending is pretty fucking harsh. (I won&#8217;t spoil it here for you.) I had trouble with it in my early 20s. So, while it&#8217;s marketed as YA, I wouldn&#8217;t class it as YA. I mean, I don&#8217;t mean to insult teenagers or anything but I had trouble with the ending and I&#8217;m pretty desensitized. So read with caution. Especially if you have daddy-issues, because the harshness of the ending revolves around the main character and her father (no it&#8217;s not a <em>Star Wars</em> ripoff).</p>\n<p>And under no circumstances should you watch the film. EVER. It was a horrible fucking ABORTION of a film and Chris Weitz should be shot. Him and the guy who made <em>The Last Exorcism</em> I mean seriously I don&#8217;t care about the content of films but there should be a law against BAD FILMMAKING WITH NO REDEEMING FEATURES. I mean, it&#8217;s not even in the vein of &#8220;B Movie that&#8217;s enjoyable in its badness&#8221; or &#8220;MST3K-able&#8221; it&#8217;s just fucking AWFUL and had me twitching and yelling in the theatre at the film festival which kind of pissed off other moviegoers but I DON&#8217;T CARE BECAUSE IT WAS THAT FUCKING BAD.</p>\n<p>The movie quite seriously bears almost no resemblance to the book, changes the ending (in a craptastic way), and butchers the story and characters so much as to make it almost unrecognizable. Weitz took an amazing piece of literature that deserved fantastic treatment at the hands of the filmmaking goddess Cinema and sacrificed it on the altar of Her enemy, Kevin Costner (he makes horrible films and he&#8217;s a horrible fucking actor). IT IS A MOVIE FORSAKEN OF THE FILM GODDESS CINEMA AND IT BLASPHEMES HER SPHERE OF INFLUENCE. All copies of it should be destroyed and the memory of it should be wiped from our heads.</p>\n<p>Anyway, yeah, you should read <em>The Golden Compass</em>, because it&#8217;s good, and you should set fire to Chris Weitz with your mind because he deserves it.</p>\n<p>Also, ducks rock.

I really really really wish I could say <em>The Black Jewels Trilogy</em> for this one, but unfortunately I keep on losing my copy of that one and haven&#8217;t replaced enough times to have read it more than five times (I have read it four times). So in the interest of full disclosure&#8230;<em>Freedom&#8217;s Landing</em>, by Anne McCaffrey.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t judge me! I was young! I did it for the <del>money</del> sex scene!</p>\n<p>To be fair, though, <em>Freedom&#8217;s Landing</em> is a pretty good book, even if it is a prime example of some of Ms McCaffrey&#8217;s Favorite Tropes (that sounds like it should be a holiday dish of some sort: Favorite Tropes! Made of tears and repetition!).</p>\n<p>She does ease up on the RACE A GOOD, RACE B EVIL (because A is for Aryan and B is for Black, see?) thing a little bit, but then puts all the blame on RACE C (for&#8230;cookies. They are a NEVER food!). To wit: book starts off with the Catteni established as the Bad Guys (with the exception of one, Zanial, who&#8217;s &#8220;good&#8221; even though he did try to rape the main character within the first 10 or so pages of the book) and the Terrans, Rugarians, Deski, and&#8230;some other alien races I&#8217;m forgetting the names of being the Good Guys. Catteni go around subjugating planets and taking slaves. One of the uses for slaves: making them colonize less-than-friendly planets for the Catteni, who will then move in and take advantage of all the slaves&#8217; hard work. Apparently this works very well for them, and is important, as it is the basis of the entire book.</p>\n<p>So, Kris Bjornsen and her fellow slaves get dropped on this planet&#8230;along with Zanial (it&#8217;s her fault she&#8217;s there, by the way, because when he made a move to grab her and rip her clothing off, she hit him over the head with a blunt object and then went to toss him in a deserted street of the main town of Barevi, only to get gassed because of the slave riots), whose life she saves by convincing the self-established leader of the slave-colonizers that Z would be useful.</p>\n<p>By the end of the book it&#8217;s revealed that the Catteni are being controlled by a greater, EVILLER race, the Eosi (so I suppose they&#8217;d be Race E), who possess Catteni and make them do really gross things (like vote Republican). It is also revealed that Zanial has an amazing cock.</p>\n<p>Because oh yes. Kris falls in love with him. And they totally do it. And it&#8217;s actually pretty hot, granted, but perhaps not the best thing for an impressionable 10 year old to be reading. Not because of the sex scene &#8212; I&#8217;m fully sex positive, and think kids can learn about sex and know about it a lot earlier than we give them credit for \u00a0&#8212; but because of the relationship dynamic.</p>\n<p>Kris is set up as a strong woman. She is shown as someone you&#8217;d <em>want</em> to be like because she&#8217;s tough and capable. This may lead some to think that McCaffrey is being feminist in her portrayal of women.</p>\n<p>Wrong. There is another character, Patty Sue. Kris gets &#8220;saddled&#8221; with her during the slaves&#8217; long trek to find a place to live (a cave system, how charming). Patty Sue is portrayed as being weak and spineless, completely timid and mousy. Kris is a &#8220;good buddy&#8221; and &#8220;tolerates&#8221; Patty&#8217;s problems, but she is never happy about it. At some point it is revealed that Patty was raped. Kris is sympathetic, but the event is not really given the attention it should have been. And then later on Patty starts seeing this guy named John (I think), and suddenly she grows a spine and &#8220;comes into herself&#8221;.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s wrong with this picture? First, it portrays the woman you want to be like (tough and capable) as being incapable of being raped, because she&#8217;s just so strong. Then it portrays the woman you don&#8217;t want to be like (mousy, timid, prudish, weak, spineless) as a rape victim, who is stolen from (and it is insinuated that this is her fault, somehow) and can only become strong when a man shows interest.</p>\n<p>News flash: <em>tough and capable women get raped too</em>. It doesn&#8217;t mean they aren&#8217;t tough and capable anymore. It means we live in a society where rape happens every few minutes, to people across the gender spectrum but disproportionately to women. Kris the character didn&#8217;t get raped because <em>she was lucky</em>, not because she was tough and capable. The Catteni were raping human women as a systematic tool of war and enslavement (gee, sound familiar?). Plenty of tough and capable women got raped.</p>\n<p>But that&#8217;s not the message that gets across. What gets across is that if you have been raped, then you&#8217;re not tough and capable: you&#8217;re a victim, and you must wait around for a man to be your saviour.</p>\n<p>And then there&#8217;s the Kris/Zanial thing. Which is the BIG PROBLEM.</p>\n<p>Zanial attempts to rape Kris when he first meets her. This is a matter of course to him: he&#8217;s Catteni, she&#8217;s Terran (and attractive, only attractive women get raped in McCaffrey&#8217;s universe). Kris does the unexpected (to him, and probably to many readers, as women are traditionally seen as victims): she hits him over the head hard enough to knock him out, and then flies him into town to abandon his body in a gutter. (This is actually quite impressive, as the Catteni have very thick skin and are from a higher-gravity planet &#8212; they are incredibly strong, agile, and swift in low-grav settings. And notoriously hard to kill or even maim.)</p>\n<p>Instead she gets captured, yadda yadda, convinces them to let Z. live. But wait. He tried to rape her, didn&#8217;t he? Why the sympathy? (To be fair: in the same situation, I&#8217;d probably convince the others to let him at least <em>wake up</em> before trying to kill him, and then if he survived in one-on-one combat to let him live as a slave to the rest of us. I&#8217;m a soft touch, though.)</p>\n<p>Well, Kris doesn&#8217;t actually see it as attempted rape. It was just&#8230;what. I don&#8217;t know. I really don&#8217;t know what the fuck she sees it as, but not rape. She feels no anger towards him, or anything &#8212; in fact she feels <em>remorse</em> for getting him stuck on this planet, and ends up getting partnered with him for recon missions, and they become friends, and then she falls in love with him.</p>\n<p>Ok, hi, in the real world, that&#8217;s Stockholm Syndrome. Or just plain old abuse, whatever.</p>\n<p>Honestly, I could understand falling in love with someone who tried to kill you &#8212; I really could &#8212; but rape? It&#8217;s such a total invasion of your person, a total disregard for your humanity or autonomy, and it&#8217;s not something you ever really get over.</p>\n<p>And yet here is a main character who&#8217;s supposed to be very feminist, very\u00a0strong and capable, falling for her attacker. Because he&#8217;s reformed, or whatever. And she&#8217;s set up to be someone who can escape abuse! Not that this is totally believable, because people are human and any one of us can fall for it, and get roped into abusive situations. But it is contrary to Kris&#8217;s character, who is set up to be this unbelievably strong person who never lets anything bad happen to her.</p>\n<p>This tells me to believe the lies my abuser may tell me, because yes &#8212; he&#8217;s probably changed and it&#8217;s my fault he was like that anyway, what was I doing so scantily clad, I must have been asking for it. So I should just not have any residual feelings about what happened and just accept the inevitable.</p>\n<p>NOT A HEALTHY MESSAGE FOR A TEN YEAR OLD.</p>\n<p>Fuck, not a healthy message for anybody, but especially not someone at an impressionable age.</p>\n<p>You may think I&#8217;m exaggerating.\u00a0<em>Oh, come on, no one is really going to believe those sorts of messages reading this book, it&#8217;s just a story!</em></p>\n<p>Let me tell you something. I know how fucking important stories are. They shape our very reality. And stories like this one hold up rape culture tropes (which, hello, McCaffrey is a HUGE FAN OF). Anything that reinforces tropes already present in society at large is guilty of perpetuating exactly the sort of society that lots of people don&#8217;t want to live in. (Quite honestly, who WOULD want to live in a society where rape is the norm?)</p>\n<p>So, yes, that part of the book is a Big Problem. It did reinforce those tropes in my own ten-year-old brain, and they were very damaging to me for a long time.</p>\n<p>If we take out the Stockholm Syndrome relationship/rape is okay! messages from the story, <em>it&#8217;s actually a solid plot</em>. And I&#8217;d reread it, because I know I&#8217;d probably enjoy it just as much as I did before.</p>\n<p>But I would recommend that anyone reading it keeps those things in mind. Enjoy the book, but remember what it reinforces. Maybe don&#8217;t give it to your kids. Borrow it from the library, as much to support libraries as to not support those ideas.</p>\n<p>Be a political reader. It can help change the world. (Ie, burn <em>Twilight</em>.

It gets a 7.5/10 from me.</strong></p>\n<p>I think, however, they tried to do too much and failed to satisfactorily resolve everything. The balancing of two separate plots worked until it didn&#8217;t &#8212; I felt there wasn&#8217;t any real resolution with the Zygons-taking-over-the-Earth plot; it felt unfinished, left hanging. I did like seeing Ten and Queen Elizabeth I together, post-Martha pre-Donna, because I had been curious about the details there. However, I didn&#8217;t really like the portrayal of Queen Elizabeth I. I suppose they were trying to make it clear that at one point she was a starry-eyed noble with thoughts of love and then the Doctor changed all that by deserting her, basically, and that&#8217;s when she went all &#8220;My blood is whiskey and my bones are iron&#8221;. It didn&#8217;t work. At all. And with Ten marrying her, it changes the past &#8212; he doesn&#8217;t leave her in a clearing somewhere, he marries her. Now, that may still inspire such a change in her as there&#8217;s no indication that Ten will see her <em>again</em> now that he&#8217;s married her. Still, <strong>I think the pre-Doctor-leaving-her Elizabeth was far too different from the ruthless queen we know from history. The change was too large, making it unbelievable.</strong></p>\n<p>Chalk this up to &#8220;Steven Moffat is terrible at writing women.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Another complaint I have is Clara. I mean, she was fantastic in this episode&#8230;but it felt like she didn&#8217;t have much of a purpose.<strong> I&#8217;m of the opinion that the mystery of Clara was solved far too early in her story arc, and that not enough time was given for her relationship with the Doctor to really develop.</strong> In <em>The Day of the Doctor</em> their interaction leads you to believe there&#8217;s a deep, good friendship there&#8230;but that interaction is not supported by the bulk of last season. Just as I feel Clara&#8217;s sacrifice wasn&#8217;t as poignant as it could have been in <em>The Name of the Doctor</em>, I feel that <em>The Day of the Doctor</em> really undersold her as a character. She doesn&#8217;t seem to be a Companion in full rights, as previous Companions have been&#8230;it almost seems as if she&#8217;s just a Doctor groupie, hanging out in the background while the Doctor is all cool and exciting.</p>\n<p>So&#8230;&#8221;Steven Moffat is terrible at writing women.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Aside those two large complaints, I did really enjoy the episode. The witty banter was in top form and watching 10 and 11 go at it was hilarious, especially with John Hurt&#8217;s Doctor there rolling his eyes and saying &#8220;Oh for god&#8217;s sake!&#8221; Billie Piper as The Moment was fantastic, and<strong> I do believe there was a bit of Rose-Badwolf there too &#8212; she saw all of space and time, after all. I&#8217;m sure she influenced The Moment directly.</strong></p>\n<p>It was good to see 10 again. He&#8217;s my Doctor, and he was as sexy and clever and fun as ever. My heart broke a little when he said &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to go.&#8221;</p>\n<p>John Hurt and Matt Smith were amazing and I loved seeing the cameo by Tom Baker. And his scarf.</p>\n<p>Finally, seeing the last days of the Time War? Definitely cool. I also liked that they paid so much attention to the battle scenes, because it&#8217;s never been <em>about</em> that with Doctor Who, and it made it very clear the point that the Doctor who fought in the War was a <em>very different Doctor</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Final verdict: good episode, will watch several times again.</strong></p>\n", "post_id": 4431, "location": false, "date": "12-12-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["stress", "stories: Stranger Skies", "NaNo2013", "Nano", "Scrivener", "writing", "writing life", "anxiety", "nanowrimo"], "text": "<p><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-4437\" alt=\"2013-Participant-Vertical-Banner\" src=\"https://amoebakat.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/2013-participant-vertical-banner.png?w=120&#038;h=240\" width=\"120\" height=\"240\" />I&#8217;m a perfectionist.

And I got so caught up with the work of publishing that I had to put writing aside.</p>\n<p>I stressed about this for a while. How could I not? I was <em>failing</em> again.</p>\n<p>And then at some point the stress just&#8230;melted away. The stress regarding Nano, at least. I got to the end of the formatting and editing work and&#8230;just never got back to Nano.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m dissatisfied with what I&#8217;ve written so far; far from it. I think I have the beginnings of a good story there. I just don&#8217;t have the energy to write in the constraints of Nano this year. And, honestly, I should really be focusing on some WiPs before I go starting new projects to get halfway through before dropping.</p>\n<p>So I&#8217;m embracing quitting this year. I&#8217;m not winning Nano; I&#8217;m not even going to up my word count any higher than where it is &#8212; a piddly 3,763.<strong> I&#8217;m letting it sit and I&#8217;m going to be okay with that</strong>.</p>\n<p>Even if I need a little help from my good friend chocolate.</p>\n", "post_id": 4436, "location": false, "date": "11-28-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["television", "Sandra Oh", "Meredith Grey", "TV", "Grey's Anatomy", "Cristina Yang"], "text": "<p><strong>I&#8217;ve loved <em>Grey&#8217;s Anatomy</em> for 3 years now.</strong> I&#8217;d seen an episode here or there since it first came out, but I didn&#8217;t start to really watch it from beginning onwards till 2011. I marathon-watched all the seasons already released and then continued to watch current seasons as the episodes came out, getting them however I could. I have cried buckets of tears over the characters. <strong>I have been drowned by the feels.</strong> I have been angry when characters have been assholes, but forgiven them later. Usually. I got my mom hooked on the show this summer and she adores it; we drink wine and watch it together. I think it reminds her of happy memories of her sister, who was a doctor, and in some way watching <em>Grey&#8217;s Anatomy</em> with mom is like spending quality time with both her and my aunt.</p>\n<p>So I was looking forward to this latest season.

I knew the show HAD to end. You can&#8217;t have <em>Grey&#8217;s Anatomy</em> without Cristina Yang. The entire series is based off the friendship between Meredith and Cristina. It&#8217;s the core of the show.</p>\n<p>So far I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s been any <em>official</em> confirmation that the show is ending with Season 10 &#8212; just rumours borne of the main cast contracts ending at the end of this season. Sandra Oh isn&#8217;t renewing her contract. She&#8217;ll be gone at the end of Season 10 regardless of actual series end.\u00a0 Which means the show will basically be over, at least for me.</p>\n<p>Before this season started I wondered how they were going to get rid of Cristina, as they&#8217;d been fairly clear that they wanted to give her a happy ending &#8212; no standard Seattle Grace Mercy DEATH ending for a cast member, no. They want Cristina to live.</p>\n<p>As soon as the season started, it became obvious how they were going to get rid of her. <strong>They&#8217;re going to destroy the friendship between her and Meredith.</strong></p>\n<p>Meredith has become insufferable this season. It&#8217;s as if she&#8217;s had a complete personality transplant; it&#8217;s as if she&#8217;s forgotten <em>who Cristina is.</em> She&#8217;s punishing Cristina for being herself, and Cristina is letting her do it.</p>\n<p>In this latest episode, Meredith goes on a TIRADE against Cristina. Several times. Finally, Shane &#8212; a resident &#8212; snaps at her and tells her that she&#8217;s out of line. Meredith makes snotty comments about how Cristina has trained him well with hero worship. Cristina takes this almost silently; when she does speak up, she only tries to smooth things over with Meredith.</p>\n<p>A few minutes later, Meredith complains to Derek about her best friend being a &#8220;mean girl&#8221; and how she didn&#8217;t mind when Cristina was being mean to <em>other</em> people but now she&#8217;s being mean to <em>her.</em></p>\n<p>SERIOUSLY?</p>\n<p>Are the writers drunk? Can they just not figure out how to send Cristina off without ruining the foundational relationship of the show or turning Meredith into a complete ass that I find myself wishing had died one of the several times she ALMOST did but didn&#8217;t?</p>\n<p>I know there are plenty of people who don&#8217;t like Meredith and never have but dear gods, even at her worst she was never <em>this</em> bad. She has become a<em> terrible person.</em></p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll be honest, I&#8217;m barely getting through this season. I&#8217;m watching it because I need some closure, but I think that after Season 10 &#8212; whether it&#8217;s the series end or not &#8212; I&#8217;m done. Cristina will be gone, and so will my main reason for watching it in the first place.</p>\n<p>If the show does officially end, I&#8217;m happy.

We sort of stopped doing much for the holiday even when she was alive, beyond making sure we made phone calls.</p>\n<p>To be honest, it&#8217;s at kind of a crappy time for family get-togethers if family members are involved in school, or live far away. If we&#8217;d all lived in Vancouver getting a couple days off work would have been simple. But I was in Nanaimo from 2008 to 2012 and mom was in Powell River &#8212; and before that, we were in Hawaii.

That&#8217;s <em>finals week</em>.</p>\n<p>So it was hard to keep the celebration going each year. Often we just let it pass with a simple &#8220;Happy Sinterklaas!&#8221; to each other.

It&#8217;s so a part of us we don&#8217;t notice it.</p>\n<p>This is true. What is also true is when parts of your culture are missing, you notice what&#8217;s not there. I&#8217;m not talking about the <em>feeling</em> of missing something that many Westerners get that then drives us to search for spiritual fulfillment elsewhere, often resulting in cultural appropriation problems. That&#8217;s a different thing, much bigger, more complicated; would make for a much longer blog post that I just don&#8217;t have the energy for right now.<strong> I&#8217;m talking about the strange feeling of being a first-generation Canadian, child to Dutch immigrants on one side and a mixed race US immigrant on the other, and the bits of culture that my parents had that I&#8217;m missing, and the bits that my grandparents had that my parents are missing too.</strong></p>\n<p>(The experience of culture loss on my dad&#8217;s side is a wholly different thing, though, and I won&#8217;t be talking about it here. I&#8217;m not trying to conflate post-WWII European immigrant experiences with 1950s Midwest American Indian experiences.)</p>\n<p>My mom came to Canada when she was 3. She spoke Dutch as her first language, but she learned English early enough that she could be considered a native speaker. She continues to speak both languages well, approaching near-fluency in Dutch (if not full fluency). If you asked her I don&#8217;t think she&#8217;d disagree with my assessment of her youth: she spent a lot of it running away from her home culture. It happens. Being a post-WWII immigrant in Canada wasn&#8217;t easy; if one could assimilate, one did.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a title=\"No houten klompen so I'm improvising with my Mary Janes.

I grew up celebrating Sinterklaas Day with my Oma, getting chocolate letters* in my <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klomp\"><em>klompen</em></a> left by the fireplace the night before, and blaming any gift mishaps on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zwarte_Piet\">Zwarte Piet</a>. (I know all about the racist implications <em>now,</em> but I didn&#8217;t <em>then.</em>)</p>\n<p><strong>Sinterklaasfeest was the main thrust of my connection to my Dutch heritage, though to this day if I need to find <a href=\"http://img3.wfrcdn.com/lf/49/hash/1100/5159506/1/Duster+Brush+with+Plastic+Dustpan+in+White.jpg\">a set of these</a> in someone else&#8217;s house it&#8217;ll take me several tries to get the English words out</strong> (while my fiance stares at me in horror and confusion, wondering if I&#8217;m having a mental breakdown as I shout at him in Dutch). Beyond a few words here and there, I don&#8217;t speak the language. I can attempt to translate it if I see it, but likely I won&#8217;t be able to.</p>\n<p>Language is so much of culture, and it&#8217;s where I really feel the missing pieces. Oma used to call me <em>schat,</em> which is an endearment. It means <em>treasure,</em> or <em>honey, darling, sweetheart</em>. There were other words, too, that I can hear her say in my head but I couldn&#8217;t write them out if my life depended on it. She and mom would talk to each other in Dutch all the time, and often &#8212; more often as she got older &#8212; Oma would weave through Dutch and English without taking a breath as she spoke to us. She spoke Dutch when she talked about the Netherlands, mostly. We would have to stop her, and ask her to translate to English for me.</p>\n<p>I spent so many years saying I was going to learn Dutch so I could just let Oma ramble on in whatever language. I tried, but I never got far. (It&#8217;s not an easy language to learn.)</p>\n<p>Throughout my life, online and in meatspace, traveling and at home, I meet other Dutch people, often folks from the Netherlands, sometimes other Dutch immigrants or children of Dutch immigrants like myself. This is when I&#8217;m really struck &#8212; by how much is familiar, and how much is alien. This is when I see that the comforting parts of my Dutch cultural heritage that I like to wrap myself in when I&#8217;m feeling homesick are like a patchwork quilt that&#8217;s missing half the patches. Only so much can be safety pinned on by visiting the Holland Shop, or going through my Oma&#8217;s things. It feels like there&#8217;s something missing, there, something fundamental.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve come to believe that the only way to find these missing pieces is to go to the Netherlands. The homeland. The source. The place where my ancestors were born and walked. The place where my mother was born. I want to go there and soak up the stories the land will give me.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s far off in the future. A huge undertaking, a trip like that. But a goal &#8212; shining ahead of me, something to work towards.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a title=\"Sinterklaas Day care package, arranged on my ancestor altar. &lt;3 by Katje van Loon, on Flickr\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/katjevanloon/11198881843/\"><img alt=\"Sinterklaas Day care package, arranged on my ancestor altar. &lt;3\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/farm6.staticflickr.com/5516/11198881843_a768e67fa4.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The goodies on the ancestor altar, where Oma and Opa can enjoy them too.</p></div>\n<p>In the meantime, <strong>an amazing friend has made Sinterklaas Day feel a bit more real, more homelike, for me this year.</strong> She lives in the Netherlands, and she put together a care package to send to me of traditional Sinterklaas Day goodies &#8212; some of which I can get in the Holland Shop, must mostly I can&#8217;t, and these were handpicked with love besides &#8212; along with the traditional poem. It arrived last week and I was able to pick it up yesterday. I immediately placed the goodies on my ancestor altar and didn&#8217;t touch them till today. My mom translated the poem from Dutch to English.</p>\n<p>It made me feel like I was really home again. Like Sinterklaas Day had come once more and the past several years were just a temporary lull. And it made me feel good about celebrating that piece of my heritage again, about finding ways of building new traditions around it so it becomes something I can introduce to my future children.</p>\n<p>Today, I got to have speculaas, kikkers &amp; muizen (marzipan/fondant covered in chocolate &#8212; really sweet, <em>really good</em>), schoentijesmix, kruidnoten, and pepernoten with my coffee. And as my dessert. I got to read a poem by a friend, written just for me. Tonight, I put out my<em> klompen</em> &#8212; ok, I put out my Mary Janes. I don&#8217;t know where my<em> klompen</em> are, and at this point I&#8217;d need new ones anyway. (Besides, according to my friend in the Netherlands <em>klompen</em> are not required &#8212; any everyday shoes will do! And often, kids will try to put out more than one pair.)</p>\n<p><strong>Today, it felt like Sinterklaasfeest for the first time in many years.</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>*<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocolate_letter\">chocolate letters</a> are sort of a big deal in my family. It&#8217;s hell on earth to find the correct letters for every person in your family (at least here in the Lower Mainland it is; the letters you need always sell out the fastest and you have to improvise), so going through the process of finding them for someone is a signal: <em>you&#8217;re part of our family now.</em> I don&#8217;t think my fiance fully understood that meaning behind it when he got me a chocolate <em>K</em> for Christmas one year, and thus was quite surprised when I started crying. (I mean, the crying was also because it reminded me of my Oma, and family, and FEELS, etc. It was a very emotional moment over chocolate, is what I&#8217;m saying.)</p>\n", "post_id": 4447, "location": false, "date": "12-05-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Not I", "Postaday", "Samuel Beckett", "Daily Prompt"], "text": "<p>There is a play by Beckett that my peers loathed and I adored when we studied it in university, strewn about the lecture hall like autumn leaves.

I support almost anything that gets filmed here.</p>\n<p><strong>Good things about the show:</strong></p>\n<p>It passes the Bechdel test consistently. The teenage characters are remarkably mature while still being believable as teens, which is nice &#8212; I get so sick of badly-written teenage characters *cough*Dawn from <em>Buffy</em>*cough*. It doesn&#8217;t shy away from darkness &#8212; that is, the danger these kids get into is <em>real,</em> and obviously real, early on in the show. The kids are pretty good about discussing consent and boundaries! The way they talk about energy and how it works is fairly accurate, to this witch&#8217;s eye, which is nice. At a point where one character suggests using an indigenous headdress as a Halloween costume, the main character shuts her down, saying it&#8217;s not cool. (Cue me dying of shock.)</p>\n<p><strong>Things that make me give it the side-eye:</strong></p>\n<p>Mainly the magic. Yes, it&#8217;s nice to see non-Hollywood ways of talking about magic and energy in a show. But. The way these teens do spells is&#8230;kind of silly, so far. I&#8217;m only about 6 episodes in. Their way of doing spells seems to consist of looking or glaring at things and saying random phrases, seemingly made up on the spot, that&#8230;don&#8217;t sound too powerful. I guess I just want it to be a little more Hollywood, you know? Use some Latin at least. <em>Some</em>thing.</p>\n<p>The other thing is the opening. When the title comes on the screen the &#8220;music&#8221; they have with it is the MOST ANNOYING sound ever. It&#8217;s a kid, I guess, going &#8220;la la la la, la la la la.&#8221; ARG.</p>\n<p>In fact, here &#8212; I found a video of the opening.

I can get to a place where physical trauma is, at least, a distant memory; not a noxious cloud that occludes my vision and breathing, that reminds me everyday that I&#8217;m broken.</p>\n<p>I often read and reread this poem by <a href=\"http://brettejenkins.blogspot.ca/\">Brett Elizabeth Jenkins</a> like a mantra:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://brettejenkins.blogspot.ca/\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4480\" alt=\"363_900\" src=\"https://amoebakat.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/363_900.jpg?w=460&#038;h=278\" width=\"460\" height=\"278\" /></a>I don&#8217;t even know the title of the poem, but it&#8217;s one I keep on my tumblr, scheduled to post in 2017.</p>\n<p>Now I suppose I can schedule one for 2020, as well.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>And in the end I ended up completing <a href=\"http://dailypost.wordpress.com/2013/12/09/multimedia-storytelling-challenge/\">the requirements for the Weekly Writing Challenge</a> anyway, so this post is tagged accordingly.</em></p>\n", "post_id": 4460, "location": false, "date": "12-13-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["love", "justice", "activism", "Postaday", "writing", "writers", "Cornel West", "words", "Apartheid in South Africa", "Crime and Justice", "Nelson Mandela"], "text": "<blockquote><p><strong><em>\u201c</em><em>It is never my custom to use words lightly.

Often I need to hit a point that&#8217;s just below overwhelm to actually accomplish things; if I have too little to do, I procrastinate, and if I have too much, I escape from the stress by doing anything except what I&#8217;m supposed to.</p>\n<p>I cleared up some necessary things in the first few days of the year, striking them off my to-do list. Right now I&#8217;m looking at trying to finish cleaning my house so I can go visit my mom in Powell River. Yes, it needs to be spotless before I leave. Is it? Not remotely.</p>\n<p>I worked as hard as I could yesterday doing this, as well as several other necessary things. (For example, writing every day &#8212; while a pleasure for me &#8212; is a <em>necessary</em> item. I view it as something I may not skip out on. Thus, I sat down to start a story and maybe write 750 words yesterday, and ended up penning just over 3,000. This morning I finished the story with another 1,144. It&#8217;s fantastic that I&#8217;m going so far over my word count goal, putting me far ahead of my current YTD goal for both Get Your Words Out and Inking It Out, but I need to reel it in a bit &#8212; if I expend too much of my momentum in one day, I often think to myself I can skip the next day. The point is to build up a steady habit of writing, not continue in the cycle of boom and bust.)</p>\n<p>I think I&#8217;m just way too tired, physically, today. When I woke up this morning I could barely make it to the kitchen to get the coffee I so obviously needed. And my body did that thing it likes to do, again, where I went to bed at 10 pm so it woke me up at 3am for no particular reason. Luckily I was able to fall asleep again, but I slept in &#8212; instead of waking up at 5:30, I woke up at 6:45.</p>\n<p>So I&#8217;m working on cleaning as fast as I can, but trying not to overtax myself. I&#8217;m having a big breakfast and moving as my back allows. I still have hopes of leaving by noon, which will put me at my mom&#8217;s place sometime in the early evening, depending on the ferry.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s to continuing productivity, even if I would have rather stayed in bed a bit longer. Every day in every way, I chip away at my undisciplined self, reaching the productive adult I know lies somewhere within.

I was a regular Grinch. I refused to decorate, and only got gifts for people under a sense of obligation and under duress. (The one exception being for my best friend, who loves the holiday &#8212; and no matter how much I hated the holiday, I loved her more and wanted to see her happy.)</p>\n<p>My feelings of hate towards this holiday started to switch when I met the Ogre. He dresses up as Santa every year, you see, and it seemed weird to hate Christmas when I was madly in love with Santa. Also, suddenly having a big family to spend the holiday with made it seem more like Christmas.</p>\n<p>So for the past 3 years I&#8217;ve enjoyed Christmas, and I thought I was looking forward to this year&#8217;s, too.</p>\n<p>Until I realized this week I don&#8217;t have any money to get anyone any gifts.</p>\n<p>Other people will be getting me gifts. I won&#8217;t have any way to repay the favor and will likely just put my name on the gifts the Ogre gives to his family member, as if I had any part in it.</p>\n<p>I like being showered in gifts but only if I can reciprocate. I hate feeling like I have nothing to give in return to people who give so much to me. (This is an emotion expressed by the various characters I write, too.)</p>\n<p>Often, my fallback would be to give gifts of my own books or things I&#8217;ve knit or crocheted &#8212; but that&#8217;s not really an option this year. I can&#8217;t afford to give any more of my books away, and only about 2 people on my gift list would actually <em>appreciate</em> a knitted or crocheted item.</p>\n<p>Long story short: I&#8217;m praying for a Christmas miracle to happen in the next few days so I can get my loved ones <em>something,</em> at least.</p>\n", "post_id": 4492, "location": false, "date": "12-18-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["body image", "fat-shaming", "Upworthy", "videos", "fat-positivity", "Postaday", "adipose tissue", "fatphobia", "self-hatred", "fat IS a feminist issue motherfrackers", "Doctor Who", "feminism", "fat acceptance", "fat talk", "Depression"], "text": "<p><strong>Trigger warning:</strong> fatphobia, silencing, diet talk</p>\n<p>Someone shared this on Facebook yesterday.

Then They Realized Who Was Being Offensive.&#8221;</a></p>\n<p>Are you rolling your eyes yet?</p>\n<p>There is a MASSIVE problem with this video. HUGE. You could even say it&#8217;s a FAT problem. So let&#8217;s talk about it.</p>\n<p>First, let&#8217;s get this out of the way: <strong>self-hatred &#8212; whether it comes from internalizing the kyriarchy&#8217;s unreasonable expectations of you or from mental illness &#8212; sucks, no matter what form it takes.</strong> If you&#8217;re hating yourself, you should work on not doing that any more, because self-hate harms you. You&#8217;re worth feeling better about yourself. You&#8217;re worth <em>good</em> things. Self-hate is not a good thing.</p>\n<p>What I take issue with in this video is the labeling of self-hatred as &#8220;fat talk&#8221;. The assumption that any time a woman/person socially-classed-as-woman says she&#8217;s fat, she&#8217;s hating herself.</p>\n<p>This not only reinforces the idea that fat is always bad, it also polices how other folks self-hate. If a woman says &#8220;I&#8217;m so skinny,&#8221; as a form of her own self-hatred, she&#8217;ll likely be met with cries of &#8220;I know! You&#8217;re so LUCKY! I wish I were that thin.&#8221; Yet a woman saying &#8220;I&#8217;m fat&#8221; is met with &#8220;Don&#8217;t be so hard on yourself! You&#8217;re <em>really</em> pretty!&#8221;</p>\n<p>As if fat and pretty can&#8217;t go together. (News flash, they can, and they do. So do <em>fat</em> and <em>fabulous,</em> or <em>fat</em> and <em>gorgeous,</em> or <em>fat</em> and <em>sexy,</em> or <em>fat</em> and <em>smart.</em> I am a prime example.)</p>\n<div style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Adipose.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"zemanta-img-inserted zemanta-img-configured\" title=\"Partners in Crime (Doctor Who)\" alt=\"Partners in Crime (Doctor Who)\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/ec/Adipose.jpg/300px-Adipose.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"172\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ok, so it&#8217;s less neutral in Doctor Who.

It means &#8220;abundance of adipose tissue&#8221;. Ask any person who actually knows something about the body and they&#8217;ll tell you: <strong>adipose tissue itself is not a negative. It&#8217;s a necessary part of the human body. We need fat to survive.</strong></p>\n<p>(And no-fat diets, by the way, are basically the worst thing ever for you. Just so you know.)</p>\n<p>Is too much fat bad for you? Maybe. <strong>Maybe not</strong>. The truth is, we don&#8217;t actually know the full truth there &#8212; there are a lot of correlations between being &#8220;overweight&#8221; (<a href=\"http://amoebakat.wordpress.com/2011/08/08/why-words-like-overweight-bother-me/\">why that word bugs me</a>) and health issues, but they aren&#8217;t actually <em>causation.</em> (For more about fat, disease risk, and correlation vs. causation, <a href=\"http://danceswithfat.wordpress.com/2013/12/17/are-fat-people-at-higher-risk/\">read this post</a>.) What <em>is</em> likely quite bad for you is a heavily sedentary life and a lot of processed food, which is <em>related</em> to weight gain, yes, but not the sole factor.</p>\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t mean fat is always unequivocally bad. Nor does it mean that fat is unattractive.</p>\n<p><strong>Yet by labeling self-hating talk as &#8220;fat talk&#8221; exclusively, this video says that fat is always bad. Fat is always unattractive. Fat, in fact, is the ONLY thing that&#8217;s bad about you &#8212; go on and self-hate about anything else and we&#8217;ll cheer you on!</strong> But don&#8217;t <em>fat talk,</em> ladies. You don&#8217;t want to call yourself <em>fat,</em> do you? Why would you want to be a fatty fat fat <em>fatterson?</em> That&#8217;s <em>bad. </em></p>\n<p>Think I&#8217;m reading too much into it? Direct quote from the video:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>Reversing</em> the fat talk. Making it <em>positive</em> talk.</p></blockquote>\n<p>They are outright stating that <em>fat is negative.</em> Always. Videos like this make it harder for fat acceptance activists to do what we do.</p>\n<p>This video is being hailed as some sort of amazing breakthrough on body image. Sorry, no. It&#8217;s more of the same old bullshit that continues to throw actual fat people under the bus. This is glaringly apparent with the phrase that shows up on the screen midway through the video: &#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t talk this way to anyone else. So why do it to yourself?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Oh, huh. I guess all the fat-hatred I&#8217;ve had lobbed my way over the years is my imagination? Because, you know, no one would EVER talk that way to ANYONE else. I guess I was hallucinating.</p>\n<p><strong>The video ends with a big silencing fest.</strong> Women literally shushing each other, and the camera, saying &#8220;Let&#8217;s fight the fat talk!&#8221;</p>\n<p>I had no idea that <em>silencing other women</em> was supposed to be a big win for women and body image. This video is saying &#8220;Shush anyone who says they&#8217;re fat.&#8221; Thanks, but no thanks &#8212; I get enough of that already from &#8220;well-meaning&#8221; folks. I really don&#8217;t need another source urging people to fight us fatties on our own damn territory. <strong>I mean, how very dare we <em>reclaim</em> a word that&#8217;s been used to marginalize us?</strong></p>\n<p>After the video, Upworthy has a credit note, and they make this comment:</p>\n<blockquote><p>So this is just a <em>bit </em>hypocritical coming from a food company that runs ads that ask &#8220;What will you gain when you lose?&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>No, Upworthy. It&#8217;s not hypocritical at all. <strong>Special K is, in fact, saying the same thing they&#8217;ve always said &#8212; FAT IS BAD.</strong> They&#8217;ve just put a different spin on it, and you and the rest of the internet have bought it, hook, line, and sinker.</p>\n", "post_id": 4536, "location": false, "date": "12-18-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Coyote", "Green Grass Running Water", "Thomas King", "characters"], "text": "<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>Favorite character in a book (of any sex or gender)</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">This is kind of a difficult question.

First of all, I love the book, highly recommend it &#8212; it&#8217;s funny, poignant, and succinct. King is a master storyteller and humble, too (I recommend listening to his CBC Massey Lecture, <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/ideas/massey-archives/2003/11/07/massey-lectures-2003-the-truth-about-stories-a-native-narrative/\">The Truth About Stories: A Native Narrative</a>), and after having the aforementioned novel assigned last semester in class I&#8217;m pretty excited to read his other works.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Coyote is the Chaotic Canine. He&#8217;s referred to as Coyote, but it never actually says that he appears as such &#8212; he could be human too. He&#8217;s always getting into trouble, or causing it. In <em>Green Grass, Running Water</em> his thread runs throughout all the stories, but mainly the creation story that pops in every few chapters and blends both Native and Christian imagery (it is even hinted at that Coyote is responsible for Mary&#8217;s &#8220;virgin&#8221; birth, which is pretty funny).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The main idea behind Coyote is that if there is Order, he will introduce Chaos to disrupt things. Because Order left alone lets things stagnate, and then we never grow. It is only Chaos that allows things to flourish &#8212; and as Chaos naturally gives rise to Order, it&#8217;s a self-perpetuating cycle.

The stories &#8216;were born of Sandburg&#8217;s desire for &#8220;American fairy tales&#8221; to match American childhood. He felt that the European stories involving royalty and knights were inappropriate, and so set his stories in a fictionalized\u00a0<a title=\"Midwestern United States\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States\">American Midwest</a>\u00a0called &#8220;the Rootabaga country&#8221; filled with farms, trains, and corn fairies.&#8217; [<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootabaga_Stories\">1</a>]</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Alongside the traditional fairy tales brought over to North America from Europe, I grew up in Canada reading <em>Rootabaga Stories</em>, and they spoke to me much more strongly than the Brothers Grimm. There was a sense of adventure alongside a definite level of ridiculousness in the stories; they were crazy enough that you could believe they were true.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">You get to the Rootabaga Country by train, and I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s this book that created my childhood love of trains (that, and travelling by train from Vancouver to LA and across to\u00a0Albuquerque and back again in an awesome trip that involved Disney Land and Universal Studios).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">There&#8217;s something very reassuring about the idea that you can get to a mythical land if you just go far enough in a train, or<a href=\"http://www.baen.com/chapters/glenrav1.htm\"> on a bike</a>, or <a href=\"http://absentangels.wordpress.com/2008/12/26/poetry-transit-stories/\">by bus</a>. \u00a0The idea that escape is always an option, if life gets too bad.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">That is why we read fiction, after all. To escape into another world, if only for a few hours. I&#8217;ve spent my life finding new ways to escape every situation &#8212; so is it any wonder the books that bring me comfort are the ones where that fantastic land is just around the corner, and I&#8217;ll see it if I just squint my eyes the right way?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Time and time again I pick up this book and read through it, and find myself content in the knowledge that if it is <em>so far, so early, and so soon</em>, that I can get\u00a0<em>a long slick yellow leather slab ticket with a blue spanch across it</em> and I will\u00a0<em>ride where the railroad tracks run off into the sky and never come back</em>.

My friend, awake now too, stomped on his boots and headed outside to feed today&#8217;s velociraptors.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d slept on the couch, which was comfortable if drafty.

The ground was covered in white, slick frost, that crunched under my feet and my cane. My friend had an earlier appointment and so left before I did.</p>\n<p>As I stood and scraped at the frost on my windshield, my car running to warm it up for a winter morning&#8217;s drive, I felt beady eyes watching me, boring into my back, my soul.

She stared at me, bobbing her head to and fro, daring me to come after her.</p>\n<p>I couldn&#8217;t leave her escaped. I had to put her back. Running late already, I hurried over to catch her and put her back over the fence.</p>\n<p>She ran, weaving like a drunk ptarmigan over the cold earth as her head turned, right, left, right, left, her eyes trying to stay on me while she ran away.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not fast on a good day and I&#8217;d left my cane in the car. I chased this chicken around for 10 minutes, yelling at her, telling her to <em>come here</em> godsdammit, calling her featherbrain. The rest of the chickens stared at me with cold eyes and suddenly I felt I knew what it was to be Link from the Legend of Zelda.</p>\n<p>The chicken I chased spooked, eventually, and decided she wanted back into her pen. Yet she could not make the flight &#8212; however she&#8217;d escaped, it&#8217;d not been over the fence, and now she flapped up against where it met the bushes, trying desperately to get away from me.</p>\n<p>I gained on her now she was in one place, more or less, and grabbed at her several times, shoving myself into the bushes as I tried to grab her gently but firmly. She panicked more and kept flapping away, squawking vociferously her protest at my obviously cruel treatment of her. Her friends joined in the chorus, henpecking me for daring to try and keep her from crossing the road to an untimely demise.</p>\n<p>Finally I grabbed her without injury (to either of us, miracle of miracles) and tossed her back over the short but too-tall-for-her fence. She ran to her cronies and they crowded around her, muttering chicken versions of &#8220;There, there, dear, it&#8217;s alright,&#8221; before moving onto plotting my death.</p>\n<p>I rolled my eyes and muttered: &#8220;You&#8217;re not dinosaurs. You&#8217;re <em>dinner,&#8221;</em> and picked the burrs off my sweater as fast I could before getting back into the car, now defrosted.

I know that some of you are aware that I don&#8217;t listen to podcasts, but I&#8217;m thinking of doing one regardless.</p>\n<p>I feel I should be clear on this. I have an auditory processing deficit. This doesn&#8217;t mean I can&#8217;t <em>hear</em> &#8212; my physical ears work fine. It does mean that what I do hear may or may not actually make it to my working memory, and from there on to my long-term memory.</p>\n<p>So when you tell me something, I may not &#8220;hear&#8221; it. It doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m not listening &#8212; I&#8217;m actually very good at listening, because I <em>have to be</em> &#8212; it just means my brain didn&#8217;t parse whatever you said well enough to store it for any length of time beyond a few minutes.</p>\n<p>This is especially true when I&#8217;m stressed, when I&#8217;m tired, when I&#8217;m trying to multi-task, or when I&#8217;m not actually looking at the speaker/fully engaged in a conversation.</p>\n<p>I hate phone conversations with people I don&#8217;t know, because if I don&#8217;t know you I can&#8217;t possibly visualize your face and how you would say the words you&#8217;re saying to me (yes, that is how I get through most phone conversations). Classroom situations can become stressful when the teacher talks too fast and refuses to slow down because I&#8217;m &#8220;not listening&#8221; well enough and I &#8220;shouldn&#8217;t have to take notes&#8221; (generally speaking my teachers are awesome about this sort of thing, but I&#8217;ve had one or two bad experiences). If I listen to a new piece of music, I can&#8217;t be doing anything else mentally engaging at the same time or I&#8217;ll have a small freak-out at not being able to concentrate on either thing.</p>\n<p>A picture may be forming here, and I hope it lets you know why, generally speaking, I don&#8217;t listen to podcasts.</p>\n<p>This does not mean I have <em>never</em> listened to a podcast or <em>will</em> never listen to a podcast &#8212; I have, and I&#8217;m sure in the future I&#8217;ll be able to sit down and hear one or two on subjects that interest me a great deal and talked about by a speaker who can fully engage my attention. But because listening to a podcast takes so much of my energy and time, as I can&#8217;t actually do anything else while listening to said podcast (not even ride transit), and I have precious little energy and time <em>as it is</em> (as should be obvious by how sporadically I post in my blogs), I can&#8217;t &#8212; in good conscience &#8212; dedicate said time to podcasts.</p>\n<p>I realize it is a bit hypocritical to start up a podcast when one doesn&#8217;t listen to them hirself, but I&#8217;m okay with being a hypocrite if it keeps my mental health more or less on the level (you know, aside from the chronic depression and anxiety issues). I&#8217;m not writing this blog post to beg you to not see me as a hypocrite; you can see me that way and I really don&#8217;t care, because I admit to it freely and I&#8217;ve made my peace with it. I&#8217;m writing this blog post because I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve actually talked about my disabilities here (or in any other blog, really) and I felt it was time.</p>\n<p>Why haven&#8217;t I talked about my disabilities in other venues before now?</p>\n<p>Quite simply: lack of<em> spoons</em> and <em>sporks</em>. Spoons are units of energy; the term was coined <a href=\"http://www.butyoudontlooksick.com/articles/written-by-christine/the-spoon-theory-written-by-christine-miserandino/\">in an article about spoon theory by Christine Miserandino</a> regarding chronic illness. Forks are give-a-fucks, or units of caring. And sporks are a unit sort of in between forks and spoons. They&#8217;re when you give a fuck, but you don&#8217;t have the spoons to actually give a fuck because you know if you spend that one fork explaining, you&#8217;ll be out of spoons for a week or so dealing with the fall-out.</p>\n<p>Part of me would really like people in my life to be aware of my difficulties so they can be prepared for my oddball behavior, but another &#8212; unfortunately large &#8212; part of me doesn&#8217;t want to be a burden on anyone, and doesn&#8217;t want to be seen as if I&#8217;m parading my disability around to try and get special treatment.</p>\n<p>And then there&#8217;s the treatment I actually <em>do</em> get if I tell people I have issues (and not just of the auditory processing kind, either).</p>\n<p>It goes one of two ways, generally. Either people are pitying or they&#8217;re complete and utter assholes.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t tell teachers that I have issues because &#8212; generally &#8212; it&#8217;s not necessary to have a learning disability to ask the teacher to slow down when speaking or to repeat something so I can write it down. Able-minded people do this all the time in class, so why should I trot out my disability to ask for the same concession that any non-disabled person would get? Especially when it gets me a reaction of either &#8220;Oh, the poor dear, it must be so hard for her to even live in such a world, of course! Can we get you anything while we&#8217;re down here kissing your ass?&#8221; which is obviously borne of fear of a lawsuit and a complete disconnect from the fact that disabled people are, you know, <em>people</em>, or even worse (0r better, can&#8217;t decide) I get laughter, derision, or complete disbelief that I actually have a disability because I&#8217;m not whipping out a mountain of paperwork right there.</p>\n<p>Well, again, I don&#8217;t go to disability services on campus because I can&#8217;t stand the pitying look I get from people, like I should be limping in there and making big doe eyes and talking about how hard life is but how I soldier on so they can look up to me for being so brave and bold and blah blah blaaaaaaah. Also, what&#8217;s the fucking point, when the only concession I could possibly need is for a teacher to talk like a human being and not a godsdamned Cylon hybrid. Not to mention &#8212; and here&#8217;s the kicker &#8212; my documentation isn&#8217;t from a doctor, so it would probably be seen as fake (even though it&#8217;s perfectly real and from an actual educational institution).</p>\n<p>Outside of class, I deal with the same attitudes, except people don&#8217;t have to worry about getting fired so I get a lot more of the explicit &#8220;You&#8217;re faking it!&#8221; attitude, with people telling me to &#8220;Suck it up&#8221; because &#8220;Everyone has it hard.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Yeah, fuck you buddy. I&#8217;m pretty aware that everyone has it hard &#8212; I&#8217;m part of everyone, remember? &#8212; and &#8220;suck it up&#8221;? What do you think I&#8217;ve been doing for the past five years? After being in Special Education for four years in High School I was so tired of being treated like I was abnormal by the system that I wanted to prove that I<em> could</em> do things like a normal student. I didn&#8217;t tell anyone at college that I have disabilities and it&#8217;s taken me this long to<em> admit to myself</em> that I<strong> can&#8217;t</strong> handle things like a normal student, that I<strong> need</strong> help.</p>\n<p>And there is <strong>no shame</strong> in not being able to do things by yourself, there is <strong>no shame</strong> in needing to ask for help from other people. But you know what, tell that to the subconscious part of my brain, the part that has been conditioned by what we believe as a capitalist, consumer, individualist culture that believes in the North American Dream and pulling oneself up by one&#8217;s bootstraps and the &#8220;Self Made Man&#8221; and all that fucking bullshit.</p>\n<p>Do you know how much shame I am feeling right now posting this? How much shame I feel whenever I ask for more time on an assignment? When I&#8217;m late with an assignment? When I can&#8217;t complete a test?</p>\n<p>Do you know how many <strong>nightmares</strong> I have about <em>getting bad grades</em>? They&#8217;re right up there at the top of the list of Katje&#8217;s Brain&#8217;s Nightmare Favorites, along with murder, alien invasions, being abandoned, and sexual abuse.</p>\n<p>I have had nervous breakdowns about tests. I have left class crying because I felt I couldn&#8217;t get something done. I have felt <em>stupid</em>, for no reason other than I am not as fast as some of the other students and I am <em>constantly reminded</em> of that.</p>\n<p>And all these factors make me terrified to ask for help. Terrified of going to my teacher and saying &#8220;I am having trouble. I need more time.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In the past I have skipped class because I got behind, and was ashamed to show my face, and ashamed to talk to my teacher about that, and once I started skipping class I got too ashamed to show up again because I hadn&#8217;t gone in weeks.</p>\n<p>Sometimes when I wake up I lie in bed and cry for twenty minutes or so because I can&#8217;t shake the nightmare, the inner voice saying <em>You&#8217;re such a stupid lazy bitch, you don&#8217;t deserve to live, you are so stupid, you&#8217;re dumb, you can&#8217;t handle simple courses, how do you ever expect to succeed at your dream job, how do you expect to graduate, no wonder it&#8217;s taken you seven years and you&#8217;re still not done, you stupid whore,</em> over and over again until I really do want to die.</p>\n<p>So, you know, when I talk about having disabilities and I am met with scorn and derision and the surety of neurotypical, able-minded people that I must be faking it to get sympathy,<strong> it really doesn&#8217;t fucking help</strong> with that whole shame complex thing.</p>\n<p>Bottom line: believe whatever you like about the veracity of my disabilities. But<strong> keep it to your fucking self</strong>. I need your pity or your dickheadedness like I need a hole in my head &#8212; actually a hole in my head might be more beneficial, as it would indicate brain surgery and hells that might fix some shit <em>who knows</em>. Everyday I am facing depression, social anxiety, and not remembering what my partner or my best friend or my parents may say to me because my brain just can&#8217;t parse it all (and always manages to remember the most useless fucking shit I swear to gods I don&#8217;t know what the <em>hell</em> it is thinking) and sometimes it&#8217;s important, and I miss it, and I feel like a shitty human being because I<em> should be more on top of this stuff</em>, I should be able to be there for people I care about and remember shit they say.</p>\n<p>So if you&#8217;re so convinced that I&#8217;m just whining for attention, or that I must be faking because I haven&#8217;t &#8220;proved&#8221; it to school that I have a disability and who in their right mind would do that (hint: I&#8217;m not in my right mind, that was sort of the fucking point here), or any other reason that I&#8217;m sure makes a lot of sense in the world of an able-minded person, please don&#8217;t tell me. Don&#8217;t let it show on your face or in your voice. Just accept that it&#8217;s my reality and move on.</p>\n<p>Because if you were close enough to me that I would accept that kind of garbage from you, you wouldn&#8217;t be saying it because you would know it wasn&#8217;t true.</p>\n<p>_____________________________________________________________</p>\n<p>This turned into a rather large rant, and it should be said that all instances of the word &#8220;you&#8221; are meant in a general sense and not aimed towards any one individual or, indeed, the general audienceship of this blog. &#8220;You&#8221; just seems to be the easiest audience to speak to when one is ranting.</p>\n<p>So yes, I am probably going to be doing a podcast, and I am aware that this makes me a hypocrite and I am fine with that, and I am fine with you seeing me as a hypocrite, if you do.</p>\n<p>The rest of the rant was said because&#8230;well, a dam burst and it got said.

With that in mind, here is my list of pretty cool/awesome things that happened this year.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Finished my second novel.</strong> In January, I finished the first draft of my second book, <em>Stranger Skies</em>. It&#8217;s now been published in ebook form, and we&#8217;re working on getting the print books out the door.</li>\n<li><strong>Got engaged to the love of my life.</strong> Yeah, the Ogre and I made it official &#8212; the same weekend I finished <em>Stranger Skies</em>, actually. That was a good weekend.</li>\n<li><strong>Finished the first draft of my third novel.</strong> <em>The Jade Star of Athering</em> is still in rewrites and edits, so it&#8217;s not really finished. But the first draft &#8212; the skeleton of the story &#8212; is complete, and I do expect to finish it and publish it in 2014.</li>\n<li><strong>Got nominated for an award.</strong> <em>Bellica</em>, my first novel, got nominated for a James Tiptree, Jr. Award. Review copies have been sent off to the judges and I wait anxiously to hear if I make the honor list. Regardless what happens &#8212; this is a HUGE deal.</li>\n<li><strong>I finished my last course at VIU and will be graduating in January.</strong> This was supposed to happen last year, and I was supposed to graduate in January 2013 &#8212; but it didn&#8217;t, and I had to take an extra course. I&#8217;m counting it as a good thing, even though it pissed me off, because <em>I&#8217;ll be done</em> with my BA very soon.</li>\n<li><strong>Thanks to the generosity of friends, I was able to raise the funds to put through the paperwork on my change of name.</strong> I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;ll be done in time for graduation, which was my deadline, but that&#8217;s okay &#8212; I can get the degree re-printed if need be, and soon enough my <em>real</em> name will become my legal name.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Tomorrow, I&#8217;ll post my list of goals/resolutions/whathaveyous that will make 2014 a much better year for me.</p>\n<p>-Plague Cat</p>\n<p>PS: Those of you waiting for a new episode/chapter of <em>Fifty Shades of Drinking</em>, I&#8217;m sorry, it&#8217;ll be a bit longer than I anticipated. I was going to get one done after Christmas but I have been far too ill to tackle it. Likely the next episode will be posted early January.

With this resolution, I promise that I will please other people only if it pleases me to do so; that I will think of my own well-being first and foremost; that I will not forget where I end and another person begins; that I will treat self-care as a primary goal, not something I tack on after everything else and then feel guilty about.</p>\n<p>While I am a stronger supporter of the idea of a community of humanity over &#8220;self-made&#8221; and &#8220;bootstraps&#8221;, there is no way I can be a contributing member to ANY community if I am not taking care of myself first. I believe anything I give a community is worthless if I am being untrue to my deepest self.</p>\n<h3>Goals</h3>\n<p>Unlike resolutions, I have a <em>lot</em> of goals and they fit better into categories&#8230;and subcategories.</p>\n<h4>Writing</h4>\n<p><strong>Word count:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Write 150,000 words in 2014</strong>. That&#8217;s 411 words a day. Things that count: fiction, poetry, blogging. Things that don&#8217;t count: worldbuilding, journaling (any writing I do at my Livejournal or Dreamwidth blogs are considered journaling, unless they&#8217;re cross-posted here &#8212; which very rarely happens). To help keep me accountable and on track, I&#8217;ve joined the communities <a href=\"http://getyourwordsout.livejournal.com\">getyourwordsout </a>and <a href=\"http://inkingitout.dreamwidth.org\">inkingitout</a> on Livejournal and Dreamwidth, respectively.</li>\n<li><strong>Reach 50,000 words in either Nanowrimo or one of the Camp Nanowrimos</strong>. I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;ll make this one or not &#8212; <a title=\"Embracing\u00a0Quitting\" href=\"http://amoebakat.wordpress.com/2013/11/28/embracing-quitting/\">I embraced quitting Nano this year</a> and that may be the start of a trend, or it may be a one-off event. I&#8217;m setting it as a goal mostly to see if last November was a one-off or the beginning of the end of my relationship with Nano.</li>\n<li><strong>Utilize the <a href=\"http://750words.com/\">750words</a> site again</strong>. My word count goal every day to make 150,000 words in 2014 is 411. I&#8217;m going to try and top that every day by hitting 750, and the 750words site is a great way to do it. Also, there are some badges I want to attempt to get.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Projects:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Finish rewrites/edits for <em>The Jade Star of Athering</em> (book 2 in The Third Age).</li>\n<li>Finish writing <em>From the Ashes</em> (book 2 in The Borderlands Saga).</li>\n<li>Finish worldbuilding for <em>Dead Transgressions</em>.</li>\n<li>Get halfway through <em>Dead Transgressions</em> (includes some necessary rewrites).</li>\n<li>Assuming I find back the files, finish<em> The Man of Bronze</em>.</li>\n<li>Start work on <em>Anala</em>, book 3 in The Third Age.</li>\n<li>Start work on Book 4 in The Third Age, as of yet not titled, occurring at the same time as <em>Anala</em>. <strong>Outline is a must!</strong></li>\n<li>Start work on <em>The Moonrunner</em> (book 3, Borderlands).</li>\n<li>Non-official goal: make real progress on my web serial, <em>Dark Fascination</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Blogging:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://amoebakat.wordpress.com/tag/postaday/\"><strong>Postaday</strong></a>: post here every day in 2014. (I am not going to be too harsh on myself if I miss a few days, but the idea here is to post consistently, not once or twice a month.)</li>\n<li><strong>Find back my blogging voice.</strong> This isn&#8217;t a goal that&#8217;s quantifiable, but it is something I want to work towards in 2014, so I&#8217;m listing it here.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Personal Stuff</h4>\n<p><em><strong>Reading</strong></em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read 10 books for pleasure</strong>. <em>For pleasure</em> means they&#8217;re not for worldbuilding research or school or something similar.</li>\n<li><strong>Make a real dent in my To Be Read pile. </strong>Ideally this would mean reading 100 books; my TBR pile is massive. Instead of giving myself a number that I&#8217;ll feel worse about not getting any closer to as time goes on, however, I&#8217;m just going to leave the goal as is: <em>make a real dent</em>. I&#8217;ll know when I&#8217;ve done it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em><strong>Cooking and baking<br />\n</strong></em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Learn to bake bread.</strong> Seriously this time. I didn&#8217;t do it in 2013 even though I said I would. I WILL in 2014.</li>\n<li><strong>Start making more things from scratch.</strong> There are a lot of things we go out and purchase that I think may be better made in the house &#8212; both financially and health-wise. I&#8217;m not a huge fan of highly processed food and it seems more and more everyday we just&#8230;don&#8217;t know what we&#8217;re eating. (It also seems more and more that people want to put aspartame into the weirdest things, which means I have to read the ingredients on EVERYTHING or die.)</li>\n<li><strong>Figure out my kitchen rhythm.</strong> When the Ogre and I live together I will be doing the cooking during the week. I need to figure out a way to make that happen so we&#8217;re both eating good, home-cooked meals and I&#8217;m not bone-exhausted by noon.</li>\n<li><strong>Bake something once a week.</strong> I used to bake about that often, when I was in high school. I miss it, and I&#8217;d like to expand my skills and repertoire.</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a title=\"They are SO DELICIOUS #cupcakes #omnom #getinmymouth by Katje van Loon, on Flickr\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/katjevanloon/10932839105/\"><img alt=\"They are SO DELICIOUS #cupcakes #omnom #getinmymouth\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/farm4.staticflickr.com/3794/10932839105_8923cf00e9.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">I mean, there definitely needs to be more of THIS in my life.</p></div>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<p><em><strong>Physical</strong></em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Start physiotherapy again</strong>.

Do said exercise.</li>\n<li><strong>Get my sleep schedule back on track and keep it there</strong>. No more of this <em>switching to nights</em> BS every weekend.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em><strong>Mental</strong></em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Work on finding a therapist.</strong> Not an easy thing, but therapy is a good thing for me and I haven&#8217;t been in far too long.

I had one of these set up on my vanity mirror for a while, but had to take it down when we were showing the place to people. I&#8217;m going to set up one that can be moved from place to place and isn&#8217;t dependent on furniture.</li>\n<li><strong>Do another Good Things Jar for 2014.</strong> I did this in 2013 and it kept me going to see it full of pieces of paper, just covered in all the good things that had happened (even if they were as simple as &#8220;Still breathing&#8221;).

A box covered in Amazon Prime stickers.</p>\n<p><em>That&#8217;s funny,</em> I thought. <em>I&#8217;m not a Prime member. Also I don&#8217;t remember ordering anything.</em></p>\n<p>Then it clicked &#8212; it must be my Christmas gift from my best friend/sister!

It was difficult, because I was as excited as a&#8230;um. Kid on Christmas. (There has to be a better analogy out there somewhere.)</p>\n<p>When I pulled away the plastic packaging, what did I find?</p>\n<p><a title=\"Christmas gift from my bff/soul-sister arrived! She knows me so well. &lt;3 by Katje van Loon, on Flickr\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/katjevanloon/11708065664/\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" alt=\"Christmas gift from my bff/soul-sister arrived! She knows me so well. &lt;3\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/farm6.staticflickr.com/5473/11708065664_929039a354.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" /></a>Only an omnibus edition of one of my most beloved book series &#8212; <em>The Black Jewels Trilogy.</em></p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve read this trilogy several times. I adored it so much in high school and college that I would constantly lend my copies out to people, just so they could see how amazing it was &#8212; then I&#8217;d buy a new copy, and the cycle would begin again. Hence why I didn&#8217;t have a copy till now, and it was on my wishlist on Amazon.</p>\n<p><em>The Black Jewels Trilogy</em> is one of my biggest inspirations as a writer. When I read <em>The Black Jewels Trilogy</em>, I learned that it was possible to write a matriarchal society in fantasy that wasn&#8217;t some anti-feminist screed. (I know there are probably other writers who have done this, and likely before Anne Bishop did. That doesn&#8217;t matter, here &#8212; what matters is <em>The Black Jewels Trilogy</em> was the first series <strong>I</strong> read where that was a thing.)</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve heard people call <em>The Black Jewels Trilogy</em> &#8220;fluffy&#8221;, and I&#8217;m sorry, but that&#8217;s bullshit. There&#8217;s romance, and some characters do get to live happily ever after &#8212; but this series is dark. There is sacrifice. There is loss. There is some seriously messed up crap going on. There are big stakes. <em>The Black Jewels Trilogy</em> is anything but fluffy.</p>\n<p>If I read it again today would I love it as much as I did in high school? I don&#8217;t honestly know. I&#8217;ve changed a lot as a reader and a writer since the last time I read the books. I&#8217;m more critical now, especially of things I love. I&#8217;m sure there are lots of problems in <em>The Black Jewels Trilogy.</em></p>\n<p>But honestly, I&#8217;m just not interested in deconstructing it and picking it apart. I may do that with other things I&#8217;m a fan of, because it&#8217;s good to pick apart the things you love &#8212; to admit that nothing is perfect, that everything has its problems. That way when you trash the stuff you hate, no one can get on your back for only picking on things you have a loathe-on for. (Or, well, they can &#8212; they just won&#8217;t have much of a solid foundation on which to base their arguments.)</p>\n<p><em>The Black Jewels Trilogy</em>, however, remains one of my first fandom obsessions, and still one of my favourite book series ever. I read the continuation books as they came out, most recently <em>The Shadow Queen</em>, <em>Shalador&#8217;s Lady</em>, and <em>Twilight&#8217;s Dawn</em>. I loved them all as much as I remember loving <em>The Black Jewels Trilogy</em> &#8212; so perhaps, if I reread the Trilogy today, I would adore it as much as I always did.</p>\n<p>I refuse to pick it apart. It&#8217;s a solace for me; it&#8217;s a comfy blanket. It reminds me that sometimes the broken and the beat down can repair themselves, can win against the forces that try to tear them apart. It reminds me that love prevails.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not pulling at those threads. I&#8217;m not pulling that blanket apart.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m putting the book in a place of honor on my shelf, and when I have some time to read some fiction this year &#8212; I&#8217;m pulling it down and reading it again.</p>\n<p>Thank you, sister. You knew exactly what I wanted, but more &#8212; you knew exactly what I needed. <strong>A reminder that the stories I write</strong> &#8212; the stories inspired so much by <em>The Black Jewels</em> &#8212; <strong>are important to other people, just as <em>The Black Jewels</em> are important to me.</strong></p>\n", "post_id": 4691, "location": false, "date": "01-02-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["life", "love", "empty jar", "Mr. Katje", "Postaday", "staying positive", "Home", "2014", "Good Things Jar", "inspiration"], "text": "<p>Last year I did a Good Things Jar &#8212; I got an empty jar, prettied it up with ribbon, and wrote good things that happened on pieces of paper.

That&#8217;s me looking ridiculously happy, or just very loopy.</p>\n<p>Next year, I&#8217;ll do the same thing, with the reading and the gluing to paper. Eventually I&#8217;ll have a journal full of all the good things that ever happened to me and my family. I plan on making this a family tradition. Even if it does make Ogre roll his eyes something fierce. It really was amazing to read through all the good things that happened last year, especially after how sour I was feeling about 2013.

Instead of doing a little bit each day, I&#8217;ve been stuck in a marathon/do nothing cycle for a long time. Place gets really messy? I do a marathon cleaning session of 13 hours which then kills me and I end up sleeping it off for several days. Then I don&#8217;t keep it clean, because I haven&#8217;t actually accumulated any habits &#8212; it&#8217;s easy to say to myself &#8220;Once it&#8217;s clean I&#8217;ll keep it that way, because I&#8217;ll want it to be clean!&#8221; The second part is true, but the first part isn&#8217;t.</p>\n<p>The mess accumulates for ages, and then I do another marathon session. Which, in itself, is a habit &#8212; a bad one.</p>\n<p>I need to learn to do several bursts of 15 or 20 minutes of cleaning each day. You can get a lot accomplished in 20 minutes. I need to learn to take breaks. And I need to drop my obsession with perfectionism.</p>\n<p>Only then will I have any chance of being an adult.</p>\n<p>Luckily, I&#8217;ve found some tools to help me, thanks to friends who let me know about them. The first is <a href=\"http://www.unfuckyourhabitat.com/\">Unfuck Your Habitat</a>. UFYH gives you a bunch of tools to help form habits of cleanliness. It&#8217;s sort of similar to FlyLady, except that UFYH doesn&#8217;t make me want to punch something. (FlyLady is great for those it&#8217;s great for; I&#8217;m not one of those people. I find myself rolling my eyes at most of what she suggests, and I&#8217;ve never stuck with the plan for more than a few days.)</p>\n<p>Instead of shining your sink as a first step, they suggest making your bed &#8212; a lot more doable, honestly, and it makes more sense. A shiny sink doesn&#8217;t motivate me to clean more in the house. A made bed does.</p>\n<p>They recommend 20/10s or 45/15s &#8212; 20 (45) minutes of cleaning followed by a 10 (15) minute break. I do something a bit modified: 15 minutes of cleaning, followed by a very long break &#8212; but I strive to do at least 4 sessions of 15 minute cleaning sprints each day. The break has to be long, because 15 minutes puts my back into a lot of pain.</p>\n<p>The other thing that helps me, which ties into the UFYH fundamentals I&#8217;m trying to employ, is <a href=\"https://habitrpg.com\">HabitRPG</a>. I joined this site a long time ago when it was still really buggy, and ended up giving up on it. No idea what my username was, so I created a new one. It&#8217;s not super buggy anymore and it&#8217;s really helping me get my shit together. I&#8217;m already level 3!</p>\n<p>HabitRPG is, basically, living your life like it&#8217;s a video game (RPG = role-playing game) &#8212; you get experience and gold for completing your tasks and forming good habits. With gold, you can purchase rewards &#8212; either things they have for sale in the item store, or meatspace things for which you set the price.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a screenshot of my homepage on HabitRPG. You can see I have several habits set up &#8212; I hit the plus signs whenever I make them &#8212; several dailies, or things that must be accomplished every day, and a to-do list, the items on which don&#8217;t have a default due date (you can set due dates individually, however). You can also add checklists to each big project to break it into manageable chunks.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://habitrpg.com/\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4754\" alt=\"Screen shot 2014-01-22 at 3.19.01 PM\" src=\"https://amoebakat.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/screen-shot-2014-01-22-at-3-19-01-pm.png\" /></a>There are also words in blue at the top &#8212; those are tags. I tag each thing I add to my list of habits, dailies, or to-do, and then if I need to see what I need to do for just that area, I can click the tag at top and only those tasks will show up. It helps if I want to focus on one thing for a while.</p>\n<p>You might notice I have &#8220;Eat Breakfast&#8221; and &#8220;Eat Lunch or Dinner&#8221; on there. That&#8217;s because it&#8217;s difficult for me to remember to have actual meals and I didn&#8217;t want to overdo it by forcing myself to have 3 a day. So long as I have breakfast and one other meal, whether lunch or dinner, I consider that a success.</p>\n<p>My health bar is full because I had a perfect day yesterday and completed all my tasks. If I don&#8217;t complete all my dailies, I get health penalties.</p>\n<p>You can take some days off if needed; there&#8217;s a tavern where you can rest for a while in case of vacation, sudden illness, etc.</p>\n<p>Your avatar is completely customizable and later on you can unlock classes and more customizations. There are guilds and parties &#8212; I&#8217;m part of a private guild of friends from a forum I&#8217;m on, but there are tons of public ones focused on common interests and things. You can be part of as many guilds as you wish.</p>\n<p>There are challenges and quests you can complete, and achievements. I think there are boss battles too but I&#8217;m not that far yet.</p>\n<p>Basically, it&#8217;s just like a real RPG &#8212; one that improves your life as you play.</p>\n<p>Now that I&#8217;m armed with UFYH and HabitRPG, I feel a bit better about mastering the skill of adulting. I feel like adulting might actually be within my grasp&#8230;in a few years.

A short bit of crappy fiction, a poem about my day, or a blog post for Monday morning that I could edit when I woke up. Maybe I&#8217;d even reach 750 words!</p>\n<p>This did not happen. Yesterday was a day full of travel and it was a pretty shitty day on top of that. My car was too full for me to nap in the back seat on the ferry rides, as I usually do, so I was awake the full trip. By the time I reached my mom&#8217;s house, I&#8217;d been up for 13 hours. My brain was fried. I was ready to sleep right then but I forced myself to stay up, because I knew if I went to bed too early I&#8217;d wake up at 2am and be unable to get back to sleep.</p>\n<p>Something similar had already happened on Sunday, even though I&#8217;d gone to bed late. I woke up at 4:30 and couldn&#8217;t seem to get back into slumber, to wake up when my alarm was set (6:30). I sighed and got out of bed and started to finish doing the laundry. I thought, briefly to myself, that maybe I should sit down and write my 411 words right then. I decided against it, thinking laundry and packing the car were higher priorities.</p>\n<p>The thing is, I was only half right. Packing the car was a higher priority if I wanted to make a morning ferry, but I had 2 extra hours during which I mainly folded and hung up clothes. That <em>wasn&#8217;t</em> a priority &#8212; I didn&#8217;t get the house as clean as I was planning, so a little bit of extra mess in the form of clean clothes sitting on the couch wouldn&#8217;t really matter, in the long run. I could have stopped at sorting and then sat down to do my words.</p>\n<p>I let my brain get the better of me in convincing me I didn&#8217;t need to do my daily words just then, and I ended up with a wordless day.</p>\n<p>I suppose I could have sat down when I got to mom&#8217;s place and pounded out 750 words of nonsense on 750words.com, getting my count in and not breaking the streak, the chain. But that&#8217;s not the <strong>point</strong> of writing every day.</p>\n<p>The <strong>point</strong> is to write something of substance. If the point were to just get the streak badges on 750words, or to pad my yearly wordcount, then I could just copy past several paragraphs of <em>Lorem Ipsum</em> and call it a day.</p>\n<p>The <strong>point</strong> is to form a daily writing habit. <a href=\"http://750words.com/\">750words.com</a>, <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/5886128/how-seinfelds-productivity-secret-fixed-my-procrastination-problem\">Don&#8217;t Break the Chain</a>, <a href=\"http://getyourwordsout.net/\">Get Your Words Out</a>, <a href=\"http://inkingitout.dreamwidth.org/\">Inking It Out</a>, the spreadsheets those communities provide &#8212; these are tools to keep me on track.

I thought I did, but I discovered while burning the gingerbread cookies of doom last month that I don&#8217;t.

(And when I get back; Ogre and I still have some gingerbread and sugar cookie dough we need to bake.)</p>\n<p>Then &#8212; Crystal Head vodka with two skull-shaped glasses. This is amazing, and I don&#8217;t even care that the vodka itself doesn&#8217;t taste that great. <em><strong>I can now pretend I&#8217;m drinking out of the skulls of my enemies.

Mom got me a 6.5 QT Electric Slow Cooker. An <a href=\"http://www.all-clad.com/\">All-Clad</a>.</p>\n<p>I have been jonesing for a slow cooker for ages. I want to learn to make delicious meals in it so that when Ogre and I live together he can come home and scoop dinner out of it and I don&#8217;t have to mess up my sleep schedule to make sure he eats right. Feeding my family is important to me. (And let&#8217;s face it, feeding <em>me</em> is important to me too.)</p>\n<p>It comes with a recipe book that I&#8217;ve flipped through a little bit. The things in it look DELICIOUS.</p>\n<p>I am so excited to get home and start using this thing.</p>\n<p>How on earth did my mom manage to score this thing when we&#8217;re hurting financially? It was on sale at her local grocery store, where she had <em><strong>half a million points</strong></em>. She waited until the slow-cooker dropped in price and then went in and used all her points to snatch it up for me.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s right. She spent all her hard-earned points on getting me the best Christmas gift ever.</p>\n<p>Bottom line? <strong>My mom is the best in the world.</strong></p>\n", "post_id": 4703, "location": false, "date": "01-08-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["communication style", "style", "Mr. Katje", "personal", "hair style", "Postaday", "clothing style", "fat", "Genderqueerly", "fashion style", "blogging", "Depression", "clothes"], "text": "<blockquote><p><em><strong>Describe your personal style, however you\u2019d like to interpret that \u2014 your clothing style, your communication style, your hair style, your eating style, anything.</strong></em></p></blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:right;\">-<a href=\"http://dailypost.wordpress.com/2014/01/08/daily-prompt-style-2/\">The Daily Post</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I&#8217;m at a bit of a loss as to what to write about today, so I thought I&#8217;d take a stab at the Daily Prompt. Of course, now I&#8217;m sitting here thinking &#8220;Uhhhhhhhhh. What on earth IS my style?&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">If I were to describe my fashion style it would be &#8220;has-been goth who can&#8217;t afford new clothing, avoids laundry, and doesn&#8217;t GAF if you think zir pyjamas and slippers are inappropriate for class&#8221;. I really just DGAF, or at least put out the front of not caring. Which is kind of funny, because I have a lot of depression and anxiety surrounding my dysphoria, how I present, and whether people will read how I&#8217;m presenting accurately.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I think my brain deals with this anxiety by making me not GAF/pretend that I don&#8217;t most of the time. But then there are days where I spend 2 hours changing clothing because <em>nothing is right</em>. Before I realized I was genderqueer I called those days my &#8220;fat days&#8221;, because I thought I was just hating myself for being fat. I eventually realized those are the days when I feel ugly and <em>wrong</em> because my body doesn&#8217;t fit the gender I am and want to present as, and I can&#8217;t seem to make my clothing work with it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Those days it&#8217;s very difficult for me to leave the house, because I feel wrong and don&#8217;t want anyone to see me.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">On days when I feel less dysphoria, however, I wear whatever. I mean, people are going to make comments &#8212; either behind my back to directly to my face &#8212; no matter what I wear, because I&#8217;m fat. People think they have the right to tell me just how wrong I am for existing unapologetically. Unless I wear what&#8217;s &#8220;acceptable&#8221; for fat people to wear, ie what works to hide all my adipose tissue, I am Doing It Wrong and deserve to be chastised. (If I&#8217;m wearing &#8220;acceptable&#8221; clothing, preferably in leopard print or covered in hideous sequins and embroidery with massive shoulder-pads because apparently there are no fat people with broad shoulders, I deserve to be &#8220;rewarded&#8221; with a &#8220;Wow, you look great, have you <em>lost weight</em>?&#8221; Pro-tip, folks: asking someone if they&#8217;ve lost weight is rude, not polite. My life is more than a number on a scale. You could ask me how my latest book is doing, instead, and show that you actually care about me as a person and not as the horrible bundle of fat cells you are being forced to share the planet with.)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">So I suppose my bottom line fashion style is &#8220;I&#8217;m fat and genderqueer, I will wear whatever I want, it will probably be in need of mending, and you can fuck right off if you have an issue with how I dress.&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The other styles are a bit easier to describe. My hair style is &#8220;wash, condition, towel-dry, comb, tie back with scrunchy for entire day&#8221;. I very rarely do more than that. If going out, I might spend an hour curling some parts of my hair &#8212; but to do the entire thing takes far too long. I have very thick hair.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">My communication style is &#8220;bad&#8221;. I mean, when speaking; I&#8217;m a lot better when writing. When speaking I always put my foot in my mouth or inadvertently insult people or say the wrong thing.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">My eating style is&#8230;well, <em>often</em> would be the simplest way of putting it, but it&#8217;s super complicated because of my eating disorders. I&#8217;ve gone into those before; don&#8217;t need to go into them again. Besides the emotional and physical minefield that eating <em>is</em> for me, however, I love food, and I like to eat.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">My interior decorating style is hippy/bohemian/<del>hoarder</del> pack-rat/fire hazard. I&#8217;m trying to pare down quite a bit to reduce a lot of the last two things, but I&#8217;ll always be pretty hippy/boho, which drives Ogre nuts.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Basically, if we were to boil down my overall style into a few words description, it would be &#8220;free spirit&#8221;.

By which I mean the words <em>crazy</em> and <em>nuts</em> are used to marginalize people with mental health problems, I have mental health problems, and I reclaim those words as my own. <a href=\"http://amoebakat.wordpress.com/category/mental-illness-and-mental-health/\">I blog about mental health and illness on occasion</a>.</li>\n<li>I&#8217;m fat. I mean, this is obvious from pictures of me, but you should know <a href=\"http://amoebakat.wordpress.com/2011/08/08/why-words-like-overweight-bother-me/\">I prefer the term <em>fat</em> to any of the &#8220;nice&#8221; euphemisms used for fat people</a> that actually serve to promote fatphobia.</li>\n<li>I&#8217;m 27 and I live in British Columbia, specifically the southwest quadrant (often seen as part of the Pacific Northwest by United Statesians). I realize the climate here is the mildest out of all of Canada. <a href=\"http://amoebakat.wordpress.com/2013/12/20/winter-is-coming-wait-dammit-its-here/\">I am still going to complain about the snow and ice and cold weather in winter</a>.</li>\n<li>I am disabled. This is something I struggle with, because I wasn&#8217;t always disabled. I&#8217;ve been disabled with my spinal injury for almost exactly 2 years, though the injury happened in 2009 (backs are funny things). I try to stay positive for my own mental health, but it&#8217;s difficult, and I often have bad days.</li>\n<li>I&#8217;m engaged to a man known as the Ogre. You will see me mention him here quite a bit. He&#8217;s 6&#8217;6&#8243; and built like a mountain. When I first met him, my nickname for him was <a href=\"http://princessbride.wikia.com/wiki/Fezzik\">Fezzik</a>. He is amazing, and I&#8217;m not quite sure it&#8217;s possible to love someone as much as I love him &#8212; yet somehow, I do.</li>\n<li>Though I am socially-classed-as-woman and I am engaged to a man, I still ID as queer, and I am still genderqueer. I also don&#8217;t consider our relationship to be heterosexual, though he does, and these two views can exist together in harmony. Identity is a complicated thing, especially when we must negotiate our own identity with how it interacts with the identity of our loved ones.</li>\n<li>My pronouns are zie/zir though I&#8217;m more concerned people get them correct when typing than when speaking. I&#8217;m still adjusting my speech patterns when I talk about myself in the third person; so long as I have difficulty with my own pronouns in spoken language I can&#8217;t expect anyone else to be perfect. For pronunciation, just think she/her with a z sound instead of a s or h sound. (zee, zur)</li>\n<li>Unless I&#8217;m putting 100% of my attention on cooking, the chances of my burning my food or ruining it some other way are about 98%. I tend to get distracted by the computer, or other things, and always forget about whatever I left in the pan/pot/oven.</li>\n<li>I&#8217;m better at not burning my baking, though cookies are still my Everest.</li>\n<li>For <em>Grey&#8217;s</em> fans, I can give you my personality in a nutshell: I am a combination of Izzie Stevens and Cristina Yang. If you&#8217;re not a <em>Grey&#8217;s Anatomy</em> fan, then you&#8217;ll just have to figure out my personality from my blog. Sorry.</li>\n<li>I adore chocolate and hazelnut together. My dream is to someday have a house with a pantry entirely devoted to a lifetime&#8217;s supply of Nutella, just for me.</li>\n<li>I love junk food as much as I love home-cooked meals full of vegetables and good, lean meats. Just, in general, I love food. Unfortunately I&#8217;m more likely to eat processed crap, because it takes less time and energy to prepare and cooking takes a lot of spoons out of me.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.butyoudontlooksick.com/wpress/articles/written-by-christine/the-spoon-theory/\">You should know what spoons are</a>; it&#8217;s a term I use a lot.</li>\n<li>I&#8217;m a fan of <em>My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic</em>, because friendship IS magic and I am basically Pinkie Pie.</li>\n<li>I watch entirely too much TV. I regret nothing.</li>\n<li>I both crave change and dislike changes to my routine. I solve this by dying my hair weird colours, or painting my nails a weird colour, or changing my blog theme&#8230;to a weird colour. Basically I look for ways I can create change that don&#8217;t actually screw up my life and it satisfies the restless wanderer in me for a short time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I think that gives you a pretty good idea of what I&#8217;m like. For the rest of it, you&#8217;ll just have to stick around.</p>\n<p>For those of you who have been here since the beginning: thank you, and I hope I&#8217;ll see you when I hit 800 posts.</p>\n<p>-Katje</p>\n", "post_id": 4720, "location": false, "date": "01-10-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["knitting", "Netflix", "My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic", "shawl", "Postaday", "rain", "writing", "ravelry", "TV", "\"wisdom\" teeth", "stockinette", "Torchwood", "dropped stitch", "Grey's Anatomy", "scarf", "word count"], "text": "<p>I did basically nothing today.

Not after watching the clusterfrack that was the &#8220;Voodoo zebra!&#8221; episode.</p>\n<p>So I switched to <em>Torchwood</em>, which mom heard a bit of while it was on &#8212; she&#8217;s intrigued! I have another show to make her watch, when we&#8217;re done with <em>Grey&#8217;s Anatomy</em>.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve been watching a lot of <em>Grey&#8217;s</em> since I got here.

I was given the book ages ago by mom and never really sat down to read it. (I have such a huge pile of books that are TBR.)</p>\n<p>The book is a look at the Hero&#8217;s Journey and how it can apply to writing and a writer&#8217;s life. The Hero&#8217;s Journey is the idea that every story is, at core, the same. It&#8217;s a monomyth paradigm put forward by Joseph Campbell.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of problems with this paradigm being touted as universal. The Hero&#8217;s Journey has a definite Western bias and trying to apply it to non-Western stories and myths is, to my mind, a form of literary colonization.</p>\n<p>However, I still think the book will be useful to <em>me.</em> Not because the Hero&#8217;s Journey is universal, but because it is specifically biased to Western civilization, and I am a Western writer, with a Western audience.</p>\n<p>The book also doesn&#8217;t push formula, which is unexpected, honestly. It puts forth the Hero&#8217;s Journey as a form, but says that to make it really work, one must internalize one&#8217;s understanding of it and then do one&#8217;s own thing. It&#8217;s form, not formula. It&#8217;s a map, with possible rest stops marked out, not an itinerary from which one may not stray.</p>\n<p>The rest stops he marks out are as follows, with my own understanding of what each rest stop means.</p>\n<h3>Act I</h3>\n<p><strong>Ordinary World</strong>: this is the beginning, where we establish what the hero&#8217;s world is like before the story begins.</p>\n<p><strong>Call to Adventure:</strong> everything changes, and the hero must leave her ordinary world.</p>\n<p><strong>Refusal of the Call:</strong> the hero resists, even if she was desperate for adventure before &#8212; this is not the adventure she had in mind.</p>\n<p><strong>Meeting with the Mentor:</strong> she meets her mentor who guides her on the path, sometimes kicking her in her reluctant ass.</p>\n<p><strong>Crossing the First Threshold:</strong> the hero finally commits to the adventure, and her story really begins. (This would be the First Plot Point.)</p>\n<h3>Act II</h3>\n<p><strong>Tests, Allies, Enemies:</strong> the hero, now on her path, must go through more tests, find allies, and create enemies.</p>\n<p><strong>Approach to the Inmost Cave:</strong> the second major threshold, where the hero prepares to face her worst fears, her most dangerous adventure, certain death, in order to gain what she seeks.</p>\n<p><strong>Ordeal:</strong> the hero hits rock bottom. This is the midpoint shift, when all seems lost &#8212; her goals and hopes are dashed, everything appears to be over.</p>\n<p><strong>Reward:</strong> after surviving the ordeal, after climbing back up from rock bottom, the hero receives her reward: the magical artifact, love, reconciliation, recognition as a hero.</p>\n<h3>Act III</h3>\n<p><strong>The Road Back:</strong> the hero must now return home, to her ordinary world, but she faces the consequences of taking on dark and powerful forces. Her return home may be fraught with more danger, more death, and she must fight off the forces from the Otherworld to which she has traveled yet again.</p>\n<p><strong>Resurrection:</strong> the hero must once again face death and survive; she must be purified before her return home. She is reborn, and becomes a different person.</p>\n<p><strong>Return with the Elixir:</strong> the hero returns home triumphantly, but she is no longer the same person who left home originally. She has been forever changed, and while home may seem the same to the casual observer, to her it is forever different. The &#8220;elixir&#8221; is that change; it is what she brought back from the otherworld, whether it&#8217;s an actual item or a lesson the hero has learned.</p>\n<p>This is an overview of the hero&#8217;s journey as I understand it from Chapter 1 of this book. You may notice I use <em>she</em> and <em>her</em> to refer to the hero; this is because hero is a gender-neutral term and one does not need to use male-as-default pronouns. Besides, my heroes are usually women.</p>\n<p>Chapter 2 is about character archetypes. I plan on doing another blog post about it whenever I read it.</p>\n<p>I do have a few complaints about the book; some things have caused me annoyance. In one of the three introductions/prefaces that appear in the third edition, the author mentions that &#8220;hero&#8221; isn&#8217;t supposed to be read as male-as-default, but then talks about how men and women might have different journeys &#8212; taking care to point out that a woman&#8217;s journey may be more to do with family, and home, and emotion, moving in a spiral or concentric circles, while a man&#8217;s journey will be out in the world, going in straight, linear lines.</p>\n<p>I reject this idea as sexist and outdated, and heavily binarist. It&#8217;s not Vogler&#8217;s fault he&#8217;s put forth this theory; it&#8217;s a common enough paradigm among women as well as men (in fact, most of the books he suggests people read to explore the idea further are <em>written by women</em>). But it assumes that every single world one might write in will have the same gender roles as our world does. As someone who&#8217;s put a lot of work into making sure the worlds I write don&#8217;t have the exact same gender roles as this one, I disagree that my female heroes will have journeys that are all about home and family, or even travelling in spirals or concentric circles.</p>\n<p>This is a large problem people have with deconstruction of stories, the tendency to slot &#8220;men&#8217;s&#8221; and &#8220;women&#8217;s&#8221; journeys as largely different, because of how these folks are socially classed (and no one really talks about what a genderqueer hero&#8217;s journey is supposed to be like, nor is there much acknowledgement of the existence of heroes who are not cisgender).</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not saying skip the book because of it; so far I&#8217;ve only read the prefaces/introductions and Chapter 1, and for all I know it only appears in that one part. I&#8217;m saying if you&#8217;re going to pick up the book, be aware of that bias and assumption, and remember that it is largely sexist and binarist.</p>\n<p>The other complaint I have so far is very small, and likely won&#8217;t matter to a lot of people, but since getting into publishing I notice things like this and it bugs me. There are some minor formatting errors. Specifically, a part where the author says something about something being laid out in a graph, and ending the sentence with a colon &#8212; this indicates the image should appear after this paragraph. It doesn&#8217;t; it appears a few paragraphs before, at the top of the page. This is the sort of thing a layout person should not be doing. The error occurs twice, too &#8212; there are two diagrams, and they are incorrectly positioned according to the text.</p>\n<p>Another error that has occurred more than once: italicizing parts of a sentence as part of titles of movies. Vogler lists several movies or stories after each example, showing where in that story that part of the Hero&#8217;s Journey occurred. He will start sentences like this: In <em>Return of the Jedi</em>, etc etc etc&#8230;. However, the layout person at this publishing company thought &#8220;In&#8221; needed to be italicized as well, so the sentence reads: <em>In Return of the Jedi</em>, etc etc etc.</p>\n<p>This may seem like a small error, but to me it&#8217;s massive. Coming from a publishing company that puts out, primarily, books and media on filmmaking and screenwriting, it&#8217;s disappointing. Leaving in an error like this &#8212; multiple times &#8212; is akin to leaving in several boom shots in a feature length film. Someone should have caught the error and fixed it.</p>\n<p>I really do hope there are no more formatting or layout errors like this in the book. It&#8217;s glaring to me, and reducing my immersion in the content of the book. I also hope there&#8217;s no more of the &#8220;men&#8217;s journey/women&#8217;s journey&#8221; stuff in there, because I&#8217;d like this book to be helpful to me &#8212; so far, it is, but more of that sexist BS and I&#8217;ll have to ragequit.</p>\n", "post_id": 4728, "location": false, "date": "01-15-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["relationships", "religion", "witchcraft", "witch things", "Postaday", "fat", "blogging", "mental health issues", "prompts", "health", "witches", "reproductive justice", "transphobia", "politics", "friends", "fatphobia", "feminism"], "text": "<p>This prompt comes from<a href=\"http://dailypost.wordpress.com/postaday/ebook-365-writing-prompts/\"> the ebook of 365 prompts put out by the Daily Post blog</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cIt\u2019s never a good idea to discuss religion or politics with people you don\u2019t really know.\u201d Agree or disagree?</p></blockquote>\n<p>Disagree, very much.</p>\n<p>In my experience, it&#8217;s better to discuss religion or politics with people you don&#8217;t know very well. By the time you&#8217;re already friends with someone, if they&#8217;re a good friend (or if they&#8217;re family), if you have severe disagreements with them on the subjects of religion or politics what good comes from discussing them? Unless you really are the rare pair who can discuss it without wanting to murder each other.</p>\n<p>Most of my politics are tied up in my life or death. That&#8217;s how it is when you&#8217;re a member of an oppressed class in an oppressive society. Abortion rights aren&#8217;t a quaint mental exercise for me; they&#8217;re a matter of whether I live or die. Fat acceptance isn&#8217;t me whining because I don&#8217;t want to lose weight; fatphobia has very real consequences for the health of fat people, and I deserve to be treated with respect no matter my size. Equal rights and protections for trans* folks aren&#8217;t just some abstract thing I can talk about with buddies over a beer; they affect my friends, they affect me &#8212; they affect our lives and safety. If I decide to present as male and I get into a situation where the cops need to see my ID, guess what? My life is at risk, because if they see &#8220;F&#8221; under sex and I don&#8217;t match what they expect in their brains, <em>there is no telling what they&#8217;ll do</em>.\u00a0 If I go to a doctor who decides that all my problems are because I&#8217;m fat and they misdiagnose me, that could have real, life-or-death consequences for me &#8212; and I&#8217;m not even getting into the mental health issues that come from living in a society that&#8217;s geared towards hating fat people.</p>\n<p>For these things that are life or death for me, there&#8217;s no room for disagreement. Because disagreeing that I deserve the right to terminate a pregnancy without legal interference is saying that I don&#8217;t deserve to have agency over my own body. Disagreeing that I have the right to present as male without fear is saying I&#8217;m not a person to you. Disagreeing that I have the right to respect no matter what my size because you&#8217;re &#8220;so concerned for my health&#8221; is saying that what really matters is not my health, but your comfort &#8212; because if you knew anything about my health, you wouldn&#8217;t say a damn thing about my needing to lose weight.</p>\n<p>As for religion, it&#8217;s not a life or death situation for me, at least not here in Canada &#8212; but it does have a lot to do with my mental health, my happiness, my life going smoothly. If I&#8217;m making friends with someone, I&#8217;d rather know early on if they&#8217;re going to try to convert me to something else every chance they get, or if they&#8217;re going to call CPS to protect my (future) kids from my &#8220;devil worship&#8221;. That&#8217;s an actual worry for someone who IDs as a witch, by the way. Don&#8217;t kid yourself that it&#8217;s not.</p>\n<p>I want to know if someone is the type of person who believes, truly believes, that they cannot be moral without religion to guide them. Because I don&#8217;t want to know those people. If religion is the only thing stopping them from hurting other people, then I don&#8217;t want to be around if they have a crisis of faith.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d rather discuss politics and religion early on in a relationship. That way, if they&#8217;re a transphobic misogynist who doesn&#8217;t really believe I&#8217;m a person with rights and freedoms, I know to not let them any further into my life. That way, if they&#8217;re not bigoted, but just very uneducated, I know exactly what I&#8217;m getting into and can decide if I want to spend the spoons on educating this person. That way, if they&#8217;re the proselytizing type, they know early on there&#8217;s no point to try with me &#8212; I&#8217;m not open to conversion tactics &#8212; I know early on that I may need to be prepared to kick them out of my life, if they don&#8217;t stop trying. That way, if they believe that religion is the only way to have a moral compass, I can say goodbye early on. I prefer my friends to be able to steer their ships with their own moral compass regardless whatever god or gods may be in their lives.</p>\n<p>I try to keep the peace with people I still want to be friends with, even if they disagree with me on politics or religion. (There are not many people like this in my life, for the record, and those that are disagree with me on portions of politics that <em>aren&#8217;t</em> life or death for me.) Discussing these things only comes up if I think we might actually make progress, instead of talking past each other and getting angry.</p>\n<p>And as for talking religion or politics with random people on the internet&#8230;.

I decided to cast on 39 stitches instead of 79; this turned out to be a good thing, as I wouldn&#8217;t have had enough yarn for a 79 stitch shawl.) Whenever I do, however, I will make sure I have plenty of time to finish the thing. It&#8217;s the sort of project you can pick up whenever you have something else to do and you need to occupy your hands with something that requires little brain power; something that can be finished over a long period of time.

Often, that character has quirks and peccadillos and weird flaws and <strong>big</strong> sins that come out in the writing that I never would associate with my friend &#8212; and by that point, the character is their own person who happens to have been named after my friend, and perhaps they share some superficial similarities but that&#8217;s really <em>it</em>.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s so obvious to me, the writer, that this character and this friend have nothing to do with each other except a name that I forget it may not be obvious to said friend when they read the story.

You may see some of yourself in other characters, and that&#8217;s likely because you&#8217;ve been such a huge influence in my life that I can&#8217;t help but to write you in some way. Or, you helped me out on one of my campaigns and got a perk where you get to be a character &#8212; that&#8217;s also a possibility, and one in which I would work with you in character creation.</p>\n<p>But if you see your name in my story, don&#8217;t tear yourself up wondering if I was subtly trying to tell you something.

I can talk to people I don&#8217;t know, I can find like minds who live miles away. I often feel utterly alone in my local, meatspace communities. I suffer from social anxiety. I find it hard to leave the house quite often. Sometimes I just can&#8217;t stand the people I meet in real life. \u00a0Often I must make nice even though I dislike someone&#8217;s behaviour, or I&#8217;m &#8220;That bitch who makes waves&#8221;.</p>\n<p>But on the internet?</p>\n<p>I can block assholes from seeing me on Facebook or Google+ or Twitter. I can ban jerks from commenting on my blog. I don&#8217;t have to be nice for the sake of keeping up social pretences. Yes, there&#8217;s an increase in bullying and harassment because anonymity makes people brave, but there are also tools that make it a bit easier on me to deal with them &#8212; I hate confrontation in meatspace and walking away isn&#8217;t always an option. On the Internet, walking away is an option.</p>\n<p>The internet is where I come together with people who have similar ideas as I do and we collaborate on how to make the world a better place. The internet is where I talk about things that are important to me, where I do consciousness-raising. The internet is where I work towards dismantling the oppressive kyriarchy in which we live.</p>\n<p>Because of the internet, free apps are available to people, and I&#8217;m able to use programs like Evernote &#8212; something that literally has saved my butt as a writer. I don&#8217;t know how I got along before discovering Evernote.</p>\n<p>(Evernote has a premium version, which I&#8217;m planning on buying when I have the money. But the internet allows me to try apps and software before paying for them as well as cutting down on packaging.)</p>\n<p>On the internet, I have my own home &#8212; this blog. My website. These are <em>my</em> spaces. My online homes, as it were. I have a history of lacking a sense of home no matter where I live in meatspace, so having a sense of a place to call home online is important to me.</p>\n<p>The internet also allows me to keep in easy contact with my meatspace friends in other parts of the world. I lived in Hawaii for 10 years, and I&#8217;ve travelled to many different countries, where I made friends from all over the world. Thanks to the internet, I can still keep in touch without racking up thousands of dollars in long-distance phone bills.</p>\n<p>Speaking of phones &#8212; I actually hate talking on the phone. I have phone anxiety. Part of this is because I can&#8217;t see the person speaking, so I have trouble understanding what they&#8217;re saying. What I don&#8217;t have is Skype anxiety. I can Skype call my friends and chat with them without having a nervous breakdown.</p>\n<p>The internet saved my relationship. I&#8217;ve been in a long-distance relationship for almost 4 years. For the first 2 years, I was a 2 hour boat ride away and only saw Ogre once a month, if that. We Skyped and Facebooked constantly, and it kept our relationship going strong.</p>\n<p>Now that I live a 40 minute drive away, we still Skype several times a week or send each other Facebook messages.</p>\n<p>Without the internet, today wouldn&#8217;t be the one year anniversary of our getting engaged. Our relationship would have crumbled a while ago.</p>\n<p>I owe so many good things in my life to the internet. And yes, I owe some bad things too, but the good things so outweigh the bad that I am being completely honest when I say:</p>\n<p>To me, the internet is the greatest thing since sliced bread.

Yet none of those fictional bonds will ever top ours &#8212; we do not have manufactured drama tearing us apart.</p>\n<p>The dramas we have are real, and few and far between, and something we are able to work through. We have almost lost each other because of severe miscommunication on one end and mental health issues on the other, but we found our way back.</p>\n<p>She&#8217;s Glinda and I&#8217;m Elphaba. Miles away from each other, not sure if we&#8217;ll see each other again any time soon, but always the dearest and best of friends.</p>\n<p>We called ourselves the A.N.A., because those were the three letters our names had in common with each other.

I haven&#8217;t been back to Hawai<b>\u02bb</b>i since I left the place a few months into 2008; I haven&#8217;t been to Alaska, and she hasn&#8217;t been here.</p>\n<p>Before that visit, we saw each other for 10 minutes in the Maui airport while I went to catch my flight and she got off hers &#8212; early December, 2006.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://onourside.wordpress.com/\">Now we keep a blog where we write letters to each other</a>.

She&#8217;ll always be there, no matter what. Someday we&#8217;ll be the crazy cat and dog ladies at the end of the block, with our several hundred canines, felines, and chickens. Of course chickens.</p>\n<p>I learned the truth about soul mates, and that it has nothing to do with sappy, &#8220;romantic&#8221; Hallmark sentiment. Ogre is the lover I choose to commit my life to &#8212; Kana is my soul mate. Nothing can destroy that bond.</p>\n<p>I learned about respecting boundaries. Kana&#8217;s always respected mine, and (I think)* I&#8217;ve always respected hers. She&#8217;s possibly the only person who hasn&#8217;t pushed at any of my boundaries; she definitely leaves my comfort zone well the fuck alone, which I appreciate. I expand at my own rate.

There&#8217;s no excuse for a bunch of typos in a traditionally published book, in my opinion &#8212; they have hundreds of editors who should be making several passes through a book.

Sean Bean has died, and I am on my way to <del>Mordor</del> my [first] Master&#8217;s. (Working title for that part of the saga: <em>The Two Theses</em>.)</p>\n<p>Graduation day was a whirlwind and it basically murdered my energy levels. I&#8217;m pretty sure I borrowed against 2 weeks&#8217; worth of <a href=\"http://www.butyoudontlooksick.com/wpress/articles/written-by-christine/the-spoon-theory/\">spoons</a> to complete that day. It was worth it; I&#8217;m just sleeping a hell of a lot right now.</p>\n<p>Early Thursday morning Mr. Katje and I got up and went to catch the 7:45 ferry to Nanaimo. (Mr. Katje got the day off work so he could come to my graduation, and he didn&#8217;t guffaw once during the long speeches &#8212; I&#8217;m so proud of him!) We had breakfast on the ferry, and once we landed in Nanaimo we had to run around doing errands for a few hours: pick up regalia, drop off tickets in various places, drop off a book for a reader. Before we knew it, it was time for me to get ready with my fellow graduates.</p>\n<p>I went to the Coast Bastion and met the other grads in the ballroom assigned to us. Several of my friends were graduating on Thursday, too, so I got to high five and hug them and take silly selfies together.</p>\n<p>My fellow First Nations Studies grads and I had a brief prayer of thanks to the Creator before we started the procession, which was great &#8212; really helped me calm my panic and nerves.</p>\n<p>I realized, before we left, that I hadn&#8217;t given Mr. Katje my camera &#8212; I ran upstairs to see if he was still in the lobby, but he wasn&#8217;t, so I held onto the thing and hoped I&#8217;d get a chance to get it to him before I got on stage. Luck held out &#8212; he and my mom were sitting right next to where we walked onstage. I bent down and gave him the camera without missing a beat.</p>\n<p>Then came the sitting on stage through all the numerous speeches that were given. Honestly, this part could have been cut way down. There was one speech that was entertaining; during the rest I had to fight not to fall asleep. Then I had to fight hunger and trying to eat the hats off my fellow graduates. I hadn&#8217;t had any food since 8 that morning, and it was 3:30 at this point. My stomach was tying itself in knots.</p>\n<p>Finally, after all the speeches, they asked us to read our oath &#8212; the acceptance of our degrees. We did, clumsily and definitely not as one, and then we got to move our tassels from the right hand side to the left. Officially graduated!</p>\n<p>And then we got to walk the stage to our names being called out. The part we&#8217;ve all been waiting for, through the interminable speechifying.</p>\n<p>Even though my name change isn&#8217;t complete, the school still let me graduate with my real name on the parchment and read out by the Dean. I didn&#8217;t think he&#8217;d have trouble with one of my middle names &#8212; Ayla &#8212; so I just told him how to pronounce the ones that usually give people trouble (my first name, especially). Ah well, 4 out of 5 done correct is really good! (And they&#8217;re all spelled correctly on the degree, so I&#8217;m happy.)</p>\n<p>I walked across the stage without my cane, which my back has still not forgiven me for, but it was worth it. It was important to my state of mind that I walk across unassisted. As I walked, I held my hands up in a gesture of thanks used in First Nations Studies classes &#8211; <em>hy&#8217;chu&#8217;qa si:em</em>, to everyone in the audience, to everyone who supported me.</p>\n<p>In the middle of the stage I shook hands with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawn_Atleo\">Shawn A-in-chut Atleo</a>, the National Chief of the Assembly of First Nations in Canada and our school chancellor, and Ralph Nilson, our school president. I then posed for a picture with them before continuing on across the stage, where our registrar Fred Jacklin shook my hand and gave me my degree.</p>\n<p>After that I sat down again, and eventually we finished and proceeded out of the theatre again, to the lobby where our friends and family waited to congratulate us. I hugged folks, took pictures, accepted wonderful gifts from friends, and then ripped off my regalia, screaming about it being a demon frock of polyestered death.</p>\n<p>Seriously, worst part of graduation: the regalia. It is hot as balls sitting in that thing under stage lights for 2 hours. Also, so-called &#8220;XL&#8221; size? HA.</p>\n<p>Anyway. After all that, we returned the regalia and headed off for dinner, which was fun but had to be quick because Mr. Katje and I had to catch the 8:15 ferry home if we wanted to get our car back from the parking lot before they closed.</p>\n<p>We were so exhausted we fell asleep in our chairs on the ferry. When we got home we staggered into bed and fell asleep within minutes.</p>\n<p>I woke up early the next day but ended up sleeping some more that afternoon, getting back to my apartment around 12:30am. I went to sleep at 3am, again, and got up at quarter to 9.

The car has to be that full, because I have to take the long way to our new place to avoid the toll bridge, and I don&#8217;t want to make a trip that long for a half-full car. Also, I have to unload in one go, because the trip between Mr. Katje&#8217;s place and the new place is far enough that I don&#8217;t want to make it twice for one load.

I&#8217;m hoping that number will go up. But writing a poem is not the same as working on <em>The Jade Star of Athering</em> or <em>From the Ashes</em> for a few hours. It uses different skills, different parts of my brain.</p>\n<p>I have completely fallen behind in my Coursera courses and cannot bring up the energy to actually do any of the work for them. This is unfortunate, as I signed up for the courses in the hopes that they would help enrich my writing life.

Right now it is all I can do to keep myself moving, fixing on a future point when I will be fully in the new place, everything will be shiny, nothing will hurt, and I will have my brain back.

They then go on to talk about <em>taking care</em> of the armpit the way it deserves&#8230;</p>\n<p>&#8230;by using this certain antiperspirant on it.</p>\n<p><strong>Because nothing says love like suffocation!</strong></p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t wear antiperspirant. I haven&#8217;t for years &#8212; not since I was young and impressionable and believed capitalist patriarchy when they said so long as I sweat at ALL I was gross and unfeminine and boys would never want to kiss me.</p>\n<p>(This made worse by my father saying, basically, the exact same thing when I hit puberty.)</p>\n<p>I used to wear antiperspirant on a not-regular, but not-once in a while basis. Why? Because then it was <em>my only option for smelling how I wanted to smell</em>. I used to wear Old Spice deodorant. I hate smelling like Old Spice. I like the smell of it, but on <em>other people</em>. (Specifically Mr. Katje.)</p>\n<p>But there were no options for me! If I went to the deodorant aisle, the &#8220;women&#8217;s&#8221; section &#8212; ie, the ones that smelled <em>how I wanted to smell</em> &#8212; was <em>nothing</em> but antiperspirant. The &#8220;men&#8217;s&#8221; section had actual non-antiperspirant deodorant.</p>\n<p>I turned to natural deodorants in an attempt to find something that smelled the way I wanted to smell &#8212; and failed miserably. I have always had very strong sweat, both in amount issued by my body and smell. Even when I wore antiperspirant, it didn&#8217;t work for as long as it said it would. By the end of the day I was sweating through it, and stinking even worse.</p>\n<p>Natural deodorants were <em>no match</em> for my super-sweat. They&#8217;d last an hour, if my luck held out.</p>\n<p>So I started using antiperspirant on occasion. Not for daily use, but for going out to parties or with my friends or on Halloween night. It would wear off by the end of the night. <em>But</em>, I thought to myself, <em>at least I smell like flowers instead of musk.</em></p>\n<p>And then the pain started. The more I used antiperspirant, the more my armpits hurt. It felt like a knife was being stabbed into them.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d heard stories about antiperspirant and breast cancer, and I panicked. Put it down and didn&#8217;t pick it up again.</p>\n<p>I mean, even if there is no link between antiperspirant and breast cancer &#8212; you&#8217;re blocking your pores for hours on end. You&#8217;re blocking an area that&#8217;s <em>meant to sweat</em> from sweating. That <em>cannot</em> be healthy.</p>\n<p>I went back to wearing deodorant, searching high and low for &#8220;women&#8217;s&#8221; non-antiperspirant. Every time I found one, it would be gone from the shelves within months and I&#8217;d have to start my search again.</p>\n<p>Recently I found one that hasn&#8217;t disappeared yet (though I may have bought 7 sticks of it right off the bat, out of fear). It smells like roses &#8212; my favourite scent &#8212; and it actually lasts most of the day (depending on how active I am).</p>\n<p>It helps that I don&#8217;t live in Hawai&#8217;i anymore, too. 90 degree days are not a friend to the person with the terrible sweat problem.</p>\n<p>It really says something that I have to <em>search high and low</em> to find a &#8220;ladies'&#8221; deodorant that isn&#8217;t antiperspirant. We, as a culture, do not want women to sweat. It&#8217;s &#8220;not attractive&#8221;. Whereas the &#8220;men&#8217;s&#8221; section is FULL of deodorant that&#8217;s not antiperspirant &#8212; yes, there is antiperspirant there, but not in the same ratio as there is for &#8220;women&#8217;s&#8221; deodorants.</p>\n<p>(You&#8217;ll notice I&#8217;ve been putting &#8220;men&#8217;s&#8221; and &#8220;women&#8217;s&#8221; in scare quotes. This is because our segregation of deodorants into gender categories based on what kind of scents they have and whether or not they stop you from sweating is <em>absolute bullshit</em>. If a woman wants to wear Old Spice because she likes the smell of it on her, that&#8217;s awesome! She should go for it! And if a man wants to wear a rose-scented deodorant, he should also be able to go for it! Instead there is stigma around more floral or &#8220;light&#8221; scents as being a &#8220;woman&#8217;s&#8221; territory, and stronger scents are seen as more &#8220;masculine&#8221;. <strong>Scents are not gendered.</strong> There&#8217;s just what you like and what smells good on you. I happen to prefer the scents assigned me as someone socially-classed-as-woman, but that does not negate my genderqueerness.)</p>\n<p>The pushing of antiperspirant on women is yet another way our patriarchal culture tells women to abuse their bodies for the sake of being seen as worthy &#8212; in this culture a woman&#8217;s worth is measured by her sex appeal, and we&#8217;re told that sex appeal does not exist if there is sweat. (Which is stupid; I mean, what do people imagine happens when you have sex? THERE IS SWEAT INVOLVED. At least there is if you&#8217;re doing it right.)</p>\n<p><strong>If you want to wear antiperspirant for your own, personal reasons, and it doesn&#8217;t have any ill effects on your health, or even if it <em>does</em> &#8212; get on with your bad self; I&#8217;m not going to tell you to stop. That is between you and whatever god of armpits you worship.</strong></p>\n<p>But if you&#8217;re wearing it because you&#8217;re expected to? If you don&#8217;t like wearing it because it hurts? If you would rather quit but feel you can&#8217;t?</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t fool yourself into thinking it&#8217;s self-care to stop your pits from sweating. Don&#8217;t let the commercials fool you either.</p>\n<p>You are not required to wear antiperspirant if you do not want to.

I&#8217;m not sure when exactly this happened; I was too preoccupied with moving since late January and surgery + recovery this week to continue with my obsessive refreshing of the Tiptree website (some of you may remember <a href=\"http://amoebakat.wordpress.com/2013/12/30/2013-in-retrospect/\">my book was nominated</a>).</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to <a href=\"http://tiptree.org/2013-james-tiptree-award\">N.A. Sulway, author of <em>Rupetta</em>, winner of the 2013 Tiptree Award</a>.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d also like to extend congratulations to the members of the honor list: Eleanor Arnason, Aliette de Bodard, Nicola Griffith, Alaya Dawn Johnson, Ann Leckie, Bennett Madison, Sarah McCarry, Janelle Monae, Helene Wecker, and S.M. Wheeler.</p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t expect <em>Bellica</em> to win the Tiptree, but I did entertain some hopes of being short-listed. I would be lying if I said my pride weren&#8217;t a little bit stung right now.</p>\n<p>But I can see the logic. <em>Bellica</em> was my first novel and it was incredibly long. It&#8217;s not terribly revolutionary. It&#8217;s <em>good</em>, but perhaps it&#8217;s not award or short list material. (And who knows &#8212; Canada Post <em>says</em> the copies of the book arrived on time, but perhaps they didn&#8217;t. That would suck, but it would also be my fault for not getting the books out earlier.)</p>\n<p>Bottom line: I&#8217;m okay with <em>Bellica</em> not winning or making the list. I think my other books will have a better chance at being listed for awards, even if I never win any (with which I am also okay). I have a lot of faith in my latest book, <em>Stranger Skies</em>, and the rest of the series that will follow.</p>\n<p>Though my pride is stung &#8212; I am a Leo, after all &#8212; I do not harbour any bitterness or resentment towards the judges or the winners. <strong>The authors on that list worked hard for this achievement and they deserve it.

No biggie&#8230;except, well, the rats are <em>huge</em>. Apparently they&#8217;re Norwegian Roof Rats, and they come into houses because they don&#8217;t like the cold. My reaction to this:</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>Norwegian</em> rats who don&#8217;t like the cold? What, did Norway send us their defective rats? What the hell? I DEMAND BETTER RATS.&#8221;</p>\n<p>::shakes fist at Norway::</p>\n<p>Yesterday morning I woke up to a loud thumping sound from the kitchen. It was a massive rat, caught in the trap under the sink. A while later another came by, and they started making more noise under the cupboard, thumping all over the place. Mom dubbed this RAT DANCE and then called the rat man to get him to come take care of the rats.</p>\n<p>Tyee was very interested in the rats, and started going into Hunter Mode. He scraped and scrabbled at the floor, hoping it would help him get into the cupboard where he could hunt the rats. This prompted me to make a comment about him helping us renovate by ripping up the kitchen linoleum. Not really, though; that stuff is tough.</p>\n<p>We would have let him hunt the rats if there were no danger of said rodents getting into some poison, but there is. Mom was at the end of her rope a while ago and put out poison for the things. She felt awful but didn&#8217;t know what else to do &#8212; she&#8217;d bought a humane trap and every time the rats took the treats out and left it still open.</p>\n<p>The original trap didn&#8217;t work, the poison didn&#8217;t work, and now we have the Rat Man and his traps. He sets the trap up, the rats get caught, he comes and gets them.</p>\n<p>If the rats could mind their own business and leave us alone we wouldn&#8217;t have to do this, but they get into our food and keep us up by running around in the walls and basically make life very difficult, so we are forced to deal with them even though we&#8217;d prefer not to hurt or torture them. Being human can be pretty rough on your soul sometimes.</p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>The fireplace and I are in love. I stand by it and it warms my butt up. This is obviously true love. We are going to elope.</p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>Tyee is worried about me, because I am always going to &#8220;the vet&#8221;. Wednesday I had surgery at the hospital, Thursday I had a doctor&#8217;s appointment, and Friday I had a follow up dentist appointment. Tyee can smell the medicine on me each time and looks at me worriedly before cocking his head in confusion, as if he&#8217;s saying &#8220;But you have no balls to cut off! What could they be doing to you?&#8221;</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s honestly not that hard to confuse a wolf-dog.</p>\n<p>(Also, you&#8217;ll notice Tyee uses the wrong pronouns for me. That&#8217;s okay; I don&#8217;t ask him to try and grasp the intricacies of my genderqueerness. I tried to explain to him a few times about it and he just looked very worried and confused, and then licked my face to show me he still loved me.)</p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>Mom&#8217;s oven is broken. The CPU is fried. The burners work but the oven(s) (pizza and regular size one both) won&#8217;t turn on, nor will the warming centre (which mom calls &#8220;the hob&#8221;). The buttons are broken, basically.</p>\n<p>However, this did not stop the oven from <em>turning itself on to 350 degrees Farenheit in the middle of the night</em> on Thursday, nor from beeping at me unprompted throughout the day Friday.</p>\n<p>It is possessed.

It <em>is</em> terrorism. When you&#8217;ve suffered abuse, you can spend years living in fear that it &#8212; that your abuser &#8212; will come back.</p>\n<p>I cut my father out of my life on my 26th birthday. I&#8217;d tried for years to have some sort of relationship with him, but every time we got off the phone I wanted to binge-eat again. Every time he dropped by unexpectedly, I spent the next several hours double- and triple-checking the door locks, my heart threatening to pound itself out of my chest.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d spent my childhood afraid of him, and when I became a teenager that fear didn&#8217;t go away &#8212; it just became tempered with rage. When I entered college, I tried to let go of the rage. For a while I fooled myself into thinking I had.</p>\n<p>I hadn&#8217;t. I&#8217;d just masked it; convinced myself my relationship with my father was good now. Never mind that no matter what I did, nothing was ever good enough for him. Never mind that every visit, every talk, every email exchange with him was full of venomous barbs, the same verbal abuse that had kept me down since I was a baby.</p>\n<p>(You think I&#8217;m exaggerating. I&#8217;m not. He started his verbal abuse the day I was born &#8212; and never stopped reminding me of exactly what he&#8217;d said, because it was <em>hilarious</em> to him.)</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve spent most of my life thinking I&#8217;m ugly, stupid, smelly, a waste of space, a worthless daughter, a mistake (his word, not mine). I was hammered with those beliefs falling from his lips like the word of god.</p>\n<p>He was always angry. You never knew what would set him off. To be near him meant walking on eggshells. Something might be a lighthearted joke one day but would have him shaking me and screaming in my face the next. His temper was completely unpredictable.</p>\n<p>He was worse when he drank scotch, which mercifully happened not that often. But I knew, if that amber liquid was in his cup, to keep my mouth shut and avoid him until he&#8217;d slept it off.</p>\n<p>During the separation, the endless divorce, I began to fear he&#8217;d murder my mom. I started doing anything I could to keep him happy &#8212; because I believed if he was happy with me, he&#8217;d leave her alone. Of course, keeping him happy never worked; I never <em>knew</em> what, exactly, would keep his mood level, and I have a deep rebellious streak that I cannot seem to tame no matter what I do. I&#8217;d always slip up, and he&#8217;d be angry again.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve lived with the fear that he&#8217;d kill my mom for almost twenty years now. He hates her, though she never did anything to him.</p>\n<p>He thinks she stole me; he thinks she brainwashed me to hate him. She didn&#8217;t. She didn&#8217;t need to &#8212; I needed no help in cultivating an unhealthy-to-me amount of hate for the dude who donated the sperm to make me.</p>\n<p>The night before my 26th birthday I got a letter from him in the mail. It was full of more abusive statements. It left me in tears on the floor of my bedroom.</p>\n<p>Then, in the perfect clarity that comes when you&#8217;ve cried out all the moisture in your body and you&#8217;re sure you&#8217;re going to die from the pain in your heart and you transcend that into a perfect numbness, <strong>I realized it was time. I had to let him go. I had to cut him out of my life.</strong></p>\n<p>I&#8217;m sure he thinks he loves me, but that&#8217;s not good enough. His &#8220;love&#8221; is toxic and abusive. His &#8220;affection&#8221; puts a shard of ice in my heart, encases me in fear.</p>\n<p>After I cut him off &#8212; sending him an email telling him I never wanted to speak to him again, never wanted to hear from him, that he was effectively dead to me &#8212; he spent a year stalking me online, asking my sister (his other daughter) to get me to talk to him, sending me messages on Facebook and via email.</p>\n<p>I, of course, felt terrible &#8212; I&#8217;d been well-groomed by him.</p>\n<p>People wonder why others don&#8217;t leave abusive relationships, whether those relationships are romantic or familial or platonic. &#8220;It can&#8217;t be that bad if she won&#8217;t leave him,&#8221; people will say. Or, &#8220;She&#8217;s obviously abusive; why won&#8217;t he go? Why won&#8217;t he help himself? I guess he&#8217;s weak and stupid.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The people who wonder this have never suffered abuse. If they had, they would know the answer as to why people don&#8217;t go, and they would know it has nothing to do with being weak or stupid, or the abuse &#8220;not being that bad&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Abusers know what they&#8217;re doing (on some level; not necessarily consciously). They&#8217;ve done it before. They&#8217;ve picked up their skills either from practice, or from having it done to them.</p>\n<p>Abusers also often come from an abusive background. This is why it&#8217;s called the cycle of abuse &#8212; people repeat roles that played out earlier in their lives.</p>\n<p>Part of the abuse cycle is grooming. Grooming is what makes it possible for people who say &#8220;I&#8217;d never be with someone who abuses me; I&#8217;d get out right away&#8221; to find themselves trapped in a long, abusive relationship.</p>\n<p>Because abusers never <strong>start out</strong> as terrorists. They start out funny and charming and smart. A bit into the relationship, you might notice a bit of a temper, but that&#8217;s normal, right? <em>Everyone</em> gets road rage from time to time&#8211;the food at that restaurant <em>was</em> really bad. Besides, they made up for it right away. They apologized for yelling. They brought flowers.</p>\n<p>Then you notice that the temper gets lost more often and the time between it and the flowers or reconciliation becomes longer. Yet the time never takes too long, always coming just when you think you might have had enough. Then you think to yourself, &#8220;No, I am really loved. People sometimes just get mad.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a process, grooming is. They get you used to a cycle of behaviour wherein they abuse you and then they apologize. By the time the really bad stuff starts &#8212; the stuff that anyone would look at and say, &#8220;That&#8217;s abuse&#8221; &#8212; you&#8217;re already tightly ensnared in the web.</p>\n<p>My father groomed me for years. I&#8217;d get the abuse, and then I&#8217;d get a reward for suffering it. I began to believe the rewards were proof he loved me, and the abuse was just his clumsy way of expressing his love.</p>\n<p>Even if that&#8217;s true, it&#8217;s no way to live.</p>\n<p>So I felt bad after I cut him out, because the rewards had trained me well &#8212; always to think about <em>him</em>, about what <strong>I</strong> was doing to him, about what a <strong>bad daughter</strong> I was.</p>\n<p>I kept the inner voice telling me I should let him back into my life at bay, and held out for a year.</p>\n<p>Around my 27th birthday, I decided to give him one last chance. It would not be without conditions.</p>\n<p>I wrote out a lengthy letter, outlining the conditions I expected him to meet if we were to have any sort of father-daughter relationship again. I was very, very clear, resolutely firm on my boundaries (which were very narrow &#8212; they must be, with him: he will take any widening of boundaries as a sign of weakness, inviting a fresh invasion).</p>\n<p>He responded with a message that broke several of the conditions outright.</p>\n<p>That did it. I was satisfied, finally, that I had done <em>everything I possibly could have</em> to save the relationship, to save <em>him</em>. I was able to put that part of myself, the part that whispered in my ear <em>But you&#8217;re not giving him a fair chance!</em> to sleep. A deep sleep from which it will never wake up.</p>\n<p>I gave him more than enough chances. I gave him more chances than he deserved. Him, the man who doesn&#8217;t believe in giving people second chances, because &#8220;Screw me once, never again!&#8221;</p>\n<p>(Everyone is out to screw him. He is paranoid and delusional.)</p>\n<p>He didn&#8217;t stop stalking me. Sent me a message around Christmas. <strong>Tried to friend my best friend to stalk me via her profile.</strong></p>\n<p>A while ago, my mom was sleeping in the other room and I was just dozing off. She had a nightmare and screamed out in the night. I woke up in a tearing hurry, convinced I&#8217;d find my father standing over her and the dog, a smoking gun in his hands. <em>He&#8217;s done it&#8211;he&#8217;s finally done it&#8211;he&#8217;s killed her and now I&#8217;ll kill him</em> ran through my tired, fear-soaked brain.</p>\n<p>Of course, Mom was fine. The dog hadn&#8217;t even stirred, which tells me there was no real danger &#8212; he&#8217;s pretty good at distinguishing. His nose would have alerted him to a stranger far before my mom would have shouted in fear.</p>\n<p>But this is the terror I live with, every day.</p>\n<p>My father knows where I live.* He says he doesn&#8217;t, because he&#8217;s a liar, but the place I live has been part of my mother&#8217;s family for over twenty years. I spent most of my childhood here, visiting my Oma. <strong>He knows where it is.</strong></p>\n<p>In late January, I started receiving calls from the intercom downstairs &#8212; you can tell it&#8217;s from there because of the double-ring. The messages were silent (if I&#8217;m not expecting anyone, I wait for it to go to message so I can see who it is before I answer &#8212; this is part of the terror). They came every day at the same time.</p>\n<p>I was scared to leave my house. Coming up from the car with a load of stuff, I would be on hyper alert, waiting to hear my father&#8217;s voice down the hallway, and ready to bolt back to the car if I did, tearing out of there in an effort to escape to anywhere else. I was convinced he was waiting downstairs to charm someone into letting him in, just as he used to do in the bad old days in the throes of divorce.</p>\n<p>It turns out the calls weren&#8217;t from him but I lived in terror for weeks, afraid he&#8217;d come by for a &#8220;visit&#8221;, to &#8220;talk&#8221; to me about &#8220;this silly silent treatment&#8221;.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s much easier to keep at bay those voices in my head that live by virtue of the grooming I&#8217;ve received when he&#8217;s <em>not physically near me</em>. Faced with him in real life, I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;d do. Cry, likely. Scream, probably. Attack him? Maybe. Tell him I was wrong (when I wasn&#8217;t) and let his toxins seep back into my life (which would eventually kill me)? Definitely possible.</p>\n<p>This is what abuse does. It turns life into a battle against terror. Every day, until the day he dies, I will fear him. that he will come back to hurt me again, to kill my mom &#8212; to finish the job he started when I was a child, to destroy me completely.</p>\n<p><strong>My father is a terrorist.

Funnily enough I wasn&#8217;t aware of this, though I have spoken openly about my eating disorders before on this blog, and I am pro-awareness about them. It showed up in my Google+ feed as I was scrolling last night, and I clicked through to read more about it.</p>\n<p>NEDA is pretty good. It acknowledges that eating disorders affect people of all races, ages, genders, and sizes. This is really important. There&#8217;s a belief in our society that &#8220;eating disorder&#8221; is synonymous with &#8220;thin, young white woman&#8221;. It&#8217;s not. Anyone can suffer from an eating disorder, and you can&#8217;t look at someone and assume they have one or not based on their appearance.</p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t know much about eating disorders, you can <a href=\"http://nedawareness.org/about-eating-disorders\">read this page and it will give you a good overview</a>. In particular, pay attention to the list of what you should or should not do if trying to help someone with an eating disorder. I&#8217;ve had everything on the <strong>Don&#8217;t</strong> list done to me by well meaning people (and some not so well meaning) and I can tell you: it all drove me further into the arms of my disordered eating.</p>\n<p>The <strong>best thing</strong> you can do for someone who suffers from an eating disorder is <strong>reaffirm their personal agency and bodily autonomy</strong>. Many of us develop eating disorders because of a feeling of loss of control; even if that&#8217;s not the cause, having our agency and autonomy denied can definitely worsen the problem.</p>\n<p>You probably love someone who suffers from eating disorders. Please read up the info on the NEDA site and learn how to deal with us. Good intentions will not make up for a lack of skill in talking about this sort of thing, nor will they un-trigger someone who&#8217;s triggered.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amoebakat.wordpress.com/2013/09/17/how-not-to-be-a-dick-to-your-friendloved-onerelative-with-eating-disorders/\">There&#8217;s also my post about how to treat a loved one with eating disorders, if you feel like reading a lot of swear words. </a></p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t know what to say, just share something on social media related to NEDA.

We weren&#8217;t going to see it otherwise; it was definitely something we didn&#8217;t want to pay money for.</p>\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t as bad as we thought it would be.

If they&#8217;d stripped out the references and the homage bits and called it something else, turned it into something original, and taken it further (which they can&#8217;t do so long as they call it <em>Robocop),</em> I think they could have had a really good, original science-fiction film.</p>\n<p>Honestly, trying to make it a <em>Robocop</em> remake I think just held them back from what could have been a new, fresh film. Which is unfortunate, because Hollywood is kind of full of half-assed reboots and remakes these days. It&#8217;d be nice to see<em>\u00a0</em>more\u00a0<em>new</em> things.\u00a0<em></em></p>\n<p>I also wasn&#8217;t impressed with the female presence in the film. In the original <em>Robocop</em> Anne Lewis was a badass cop who was <em>unstoppable,</em> and that was without being turned into a half-robot killing machine. In the new <em>Robocop,</em> she doesn&#8217;t exist &#8212; Murphy&#8217;s partner is <em>Jack</em> Lewis, and he&#8217;s nowhere near as badass as Anne was.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Officer Anne Lewis&#8217; first action in the original was kicking criminal ass, and her last was responding to multiple gunshot wounds with high-explosive armor-piercing assault cannon fire.</p>\n<p>She was so tough, she endured all three <i>RoboCops</i>. Even the original RoboCop wasn&#8217;t tough enough to take that, and he had armor to hide his face and shame. But the new movie hated the idea of a tough woman so much that they turned her into a man and then shot her anyway, all before RoboCop even turns up.</p></blockquote>\n<div style=\"text-align:right;\"><a href=\"http://www.cracked.com/blog/5-signs-new-robocop-movie-might-be-terrible_p2/#ixzz2upqlWvXE\">Source</a></div>\n<p>The wife? I&#8217;ve met teaspoons with more emotional depth. Clara Murphy stayed locked in <em>sadness and tears</em> mode for 99% of the film. The other 1% she was sad but not crying. OH MY GODS HOW DYNAMIC</p>\n<p>The woman from Omnicorp&#8217;s Legal dept (Liz Kline) and the chief of police (Karen Dean) were almost as one-dimensional as the wife. The only female character I felt interested in at all, as a character, was Dr. Morgan&#8217;s lab assistant (Jae Kim). <em>She</em> had some depth.</p>\n<p>Also, the film did not pass the Bechdel test &#8212; which is not a measurement of the depth or complexity of female characters, or even a measurement of how feminist a film is; it is a measurement of the<em> presence of women who are not accessories to men</em>. Every conversation the women had, if they interacted at all, was about Alex Murphy. You can make the argument that he&#8217;s more machine than man so the movie <em>technically</em> passes, but I will give you the side-eye so hard you won&#8217;t know what hit you.</p>\n<p>By itself a failure to pass the Bechdel test doesn&#8217;t say anything about the depth or complexity of the female characters in a film or movie. Combined with the shitty treatment of female characters in <em>RoboCop,</em> it says a lot.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s pretty sad that the <em>2014</em> remake of a <em>1987</em> film did worse than the original with regards to depth and range of female characters when it had 4x as many chances to get it right.</p>\n<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> don&#8217;t see this one in the theatres.

Runny nose, inflamed eyes, hives, itching constantly &#8212; itching so bad I wanted to cut off my skin and set it aflame. I thought I was dying. I thought it was measles (there&#8217;s an outbreak in our area and I&#8217;m missing one of the shots). I thought I was patient 0 in the upcoming zombie apocalypse.</p>\n<p>Whatever I thought, I couldn&#8217;t think straight. Couldn&#8217;t work, could <em>barely</em> keep house. Most times I couldn&#8217;t even concentrate on watching TV shows, which uses the least brain power like, ever.</p>\n<p>The itching on my feet was the worst. At some point I attacked them with a pumice stone, viciously trying to scratch the itch out of my skin. It didn&#8217;t work, but the calluses are much smoother now.</p>\n<p>For three days I suffered until finally Mr. Katje kicked me out the door to go get some godsdamned antihistamines, for Zeus&#8217; sweet sake. (Actually I don&#8217;t really think Zeus cares if I&#8217;m itching or not; I think it&#8217;s rather a thing below his sphere of &#8220;Shit I Care About&#8221;.) I&#8217;m sure he would have picked them up for me if his work schedule didn&#8217;t prevent him from doing so.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not really sure how I looked to the people who saw me at the grocery store, but I&#8217;m sure it wasn&#8217;t pretty. Red-faced, red-eyed, frizzy hair. Jittering and rubbing my hands together constantly like a raccoon hoped up on caffeine pills, scratching my wrists and my arms and my neck and face, my head &#8212; whatever skin was exposed. I rubbed my legs together like a cricket and did little dances in the aisles, trying desperately to rub the arches of my feet against the inner soles of my shoes, anything to stop the ever present itch from HELL.</p>\n<p>I was so out of it from the allergy attack that it took me agonizingly long to find the antihistamines in the pharmacy section, and even longer to decide which one to get. I wanted non-drowsy, but budget won out &#8212; I got the 10 dollar cheaper drowsy meds, no-name brand. Perhaps there was non-drowsy no-name for the same price, but I didn&#8217;t see it. My eyes and brain were failing fast.</p>\n<p>I also picked up some itch relief cream for some immediate relief for my hands. That was more expensive than the allergy pills, and it didn&#8217;t work for shit.</p>\n<p>Dancing and jittering out of the pharmacy section, I picked up a new 4L bottle of milk on my way to the checkout. I got through as fast as possible and went home as fast as I could, eager to take pills.</p>\n<p>1 &#8211; 2 pills every 4 to 6 hours. I took 2, because the attack was so bad I knew I&#8217;d need it.</p>\n<p>A few hours later I fell asleep onto my keyboard. Keyboard face isn&#8217;t very attractive but it was so worth it. A little while later I staggered up and went to bed at 6pm. I slept for 4 hours, and went back to sleep at 5 am.</p>\n<p>Woke up at 8am today but despite the short sleep sessions, I feel 100 times better than I did yesterday. The allergy pills are fucking miracles. I can finally function again &#8212; as you can no doubt tell, seeing as I&#8217;m sitting here writing this post.</p>\n<p>Mr. Katje and I spent some time trying to figure out what caused the allergy attack. We just moved; there are a lot of new environmental factors in our lives. We narrowed it down to the new laundry detergent being the culprit. I&#8217;ve always had sensitive skin, and have always had to use sensitive skin laundry detergents. We didn&#8217;t check carefully enough when we picked this one up &#8212; we thought it was sensitive skin, because it was scent-free, but it wasn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s a brand we&#8217;ve never bought before &#8212; Cheer &#8212; and the only reason we got it was because we were at Costco and it was the only scent-free detergent there.</p>\n<p>(Both of us get headaches from scented laundry detergents, and often the scents cause allergic skin reactions for me. The only scented laundry detergents I can stand are the Arm and Hammer ones.)</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not bugging Mr. Katje, so likely he&#8217;ll continue to use it for his work clothes. In order to save my sanity and my skin, I&#8217;m switching to the Tide Free and Clear for my clothes, any clothing of his I may borrow, our towels, and our sheets.</p>\n<p>Thus is beginning the Great Rewashing of 2014. I&#8217;ve done several loads of laundry in the past 3 weeks &#8212; we both had dirty clothing from the move and from everyday wear, and our new washer is&#8230;incredibly small, compared to our last washers. We even have less clothing than we did, but now we&#8217;re doing more laundry.</p>\n<p>I have to rewash almost everything I own. There are very few things I&#8217;m <em>absolutely sure</em> I haven&#8217;t washed in the Cheer. If there&#8217;s any doubt in my mind about a piece of clothing, it gets rewashed. I cannot risk another reaction like this.</p>\n<p>Today I started with a load of pants and skirts, and ALL my underwear. Those seemed the most important. The last load I&#8217;m doing today is our sheets and duvet covers, as soon as Mr. Katje is awake and off to work &#8212; these are actually the most important things to rewash, but I couldn&#8217;t start with them because of our different sleep schedules. Tomorrow, shirts, socks, and towels. And so on and so forth, till the end of time.</p>\n<p>I feel guilty using the washer and dryer so much, and for clothing that&#8217;s ostensibly clean. But there&#8217;s no other option. I can&#8217;t continue to wear clothing that will give me an allergic reaction.</p>\n<p>Yes, theoretically I could go to the laundromat. If I could drive. So long as I&#8217;m taking the allergy pills, I can&#8217;t operate heavy machinery. Until I can stop taking the pills or we can get me the non-drowsy kind, I&#8217;m homebound unless Mr. Katje is driving. As his truck is still full of stuff and he&#8217;s working tonight, I&#8217;m definitely not going anywhere today.</p>\n<p>So it&#8217;s into battle with the laundry on the battlefield of the living room I go.</p>\n<p><em>Katje dons a suit of armor and goes charging at windmills with zir lance. &#8220;The Impossible Dream&#8221; plays in the distance.

Of course, because I have impossibly high standards for myself and I am incredibly hard on myself all the time, this has only added to the depression as I&#8217;ve been unable to complete as much work as I want to, and that is, my brain tells me, my fault because I am lazy and horrible.</p>\n<p>This is a sneaky way the depression and anxiety manifest themselves: make me have impossibly high standards so when I inevitably fail them I can hate myself more. Huzzah! Ale and whores for everyone, except Katje, because screw zir.</p>\n<p>I haven&#8217;t really been able to talk to people about this, because some of the conversations I&#8217;ve had about it have gone like this:</p>\n<p>Me: My fish are dead.<br />\nOther person: Have you tried feeding them?<br />\nMe: They&#8217;re dead.<br />\nOther person: I&#8217;ll help you look for them!<br />\nMe: My fish. are. dead.<br />\nOther person: Do you know why they&#8217;re missing?<br />\nMe: <a href=\"http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.ca/2013/05/depression-part-two.html\">Why can&#8217;t anyone see how dead these fish are?</a></p>\n<p>(Analogy courtesy Allie Brosh.)</p>\n<p>And it becomes exhausting trying to figure out who will see my fish are dead and who won&#8217;t, so I just don&#8217;t talk about it with anyone. I&#8217;m tired of people asking about the reasons behind my depression, as if 20 years of mental illness has a fucking reason. I&#8217;m sick. I have a disease. It flares up. There&#8217;s no reason except that&#8217;s what happens and I&#8217;m stuck dealing with it.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m tired of people suggesting going outside and getting oxygen as a way to make me feel better (pro-tip, I get cold easy and have allergies; going outside in springtime is not going to make me feel better by any stretch of the imagination unless it&#8217;s a ridiculously sunny and warm day and I have a few hours to kill at the park WITH A DOG and as I have no dog and this is Vancouver where the sun is afraid to come lest it be stabbed by someone, it is unlikely going outside will magically cure my depression).</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m tired of people suggesting ANYTHING as a magical cure for my depression. These reactions to &#8220;I have depression&#8221; are accepted and encouraged and yet if you said &#8220;Well have you tried vitamin D/being co-dependent on your fiance/oxygen/water/life/not having it/insert newest yuppie health craze item here?&#8221; to someone suffering from cancer or some other visible illness you&#8217;d be a Grade A Douchecanoe.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m tired of people saying &#8220;Well you sound really upbeat! You don&#8217;t sound depressed at all!&#8221; Thanks for letting me know my camouflage is working; I&#8217;ve only been perfecting the mechanism for 20 years.</p>\n<p>People don&#8217;t like you when you&#8217;re depressed. This isn&#8217;t Hundred Acre Wood, and my friends are not going to continue to be my friends when I&#8217;m Eeyore all the damn time. Sad truth about the world &#8212; <strong>people abandon you when you need them most</strong>. Because you &#8220;won&#8217;t accept their help&#8221; (when they can&#8217;t understand what help you really need because they&#8217;ve never been through it themselves and thus think that suggesting Vitamin D or some good old fashioned exercise will &#8220;get you out of that funk&#8221; and raring to go again). Because you &#8220;want to be depressed&#8221; (yes, totally, thinking about killing or hurting myself all the time and being unable to function as a human being and breaking down in tears because I burned dinner is awesome! Who wouldn&#8217;t want this?). Because you&#8217;re &#8220;looking for attention/whining/making mountains out of molehills&#8221; if you dare talk about your problems honestly, if you dare answer &#8220;how are you?&#8221; with anything other than &#8220;I&#8217;m fine, just tired&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Having mental illness means you learn to minimize what&#8217;s going on with you, or you learn to be alone.</p>\n<p>Depression becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy that way. Your inner voices say everyone will leave you because you&#8217;re worthless; you talk honestly about your problems; people who don&#8217;t understand depression leave you because they don&#8217;t understand; this reinforces what depression has told you and drives you further into its arms.</p>\n<p>So, yes. My Facebook has (mostly) been silent or mainly happy for a month now. I posted once about being depressed but I made sure the post was funny, and not depressing. Because I didn&#8217;t want to alienate anyone by being honest about my illness.</p>\n<p>If I feel like posting about how something in my life has gone awry, or how I&#8217;m feeling shitty, I don&#8217;t. Not because I believe in the power of positive thinking, or because I think posting about it will make me feel worse (often I think it&#8217;ll make me feel better). Because I have learned how to minimize my problems to the rest of the world so they&#8217;ll continue to like me. (And because I&#8217;m tired of dealing with the fallout of &#8220;helpful advice&#8221;.)</p>\n<p>This is why I&#8217;ve been silent on this blog for so long. I couldn&#8217;t find anything to say that wasn&#8217;t &#8220;I&#8217;m really, really depressed right now and having trouble finding the will to continue existing.&#8221; And heavens forfend I&#8217;m honest about that on my blog, where I need to be happy and funny all the time, or I&#8217;ll lose readers.</p>\n<p>And I&#8217;m tired of it. I&#8217;m tired of minimizing my problems; I&#8217;m tired of constantly arguing against the minimization done of them by others.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m depressed. Deal with it. I have for 20+ years. It is not a small deal. It is a big deal, but don&#8217;t worry, if I can handle it so can you.</p>\n<p>I will not be magically cured by oxygen or water or vitamin D or whatever thing is being heralded as a magical cure for depression. My meds and going to therapy will help. They will not &#8220;fix&#8221; me, not overnight, and perhaps never. I cannot always function because of my depression, and that means I might not be able to come out to meet you for coffee or even talk to you on the phone. I might not be able to do much more than stay in and try to keep the ever-creeping mess from swallowing me and Mr. Katje whole. This is not me being lazy; this is me desperately fighting to survive.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not minimizing anymore. I&#8217;m speaking honestly about what&#8217;s going on with me.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m ill. I&#8217;m fighting a battle against a disease that is often terminal. I have good days and bad days. Sometimes, it&#8217;s mostly bad days. So far I have not succumbed to the disease. So far I am <strong>still alive</strong>.</p>\n<p>That is more than a lot of people can say, including my late aunt, who lost her battle with depression when I was a child.</p>\n<p>If my honesty depresses you, if you think I&#8217;m just looking for attention, if you don&#8217;t want to read about my battle with the illness because the illness is killing my optimism cells and making it difficult for me to look on the bright side of anything, if you think I am exaggerating &#8212; the door is over there. Leave my blog, leave my life.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m fighting a battle where the best support you can give me is a listening ear and unconditional belief that I am <strong>telling the truth</strong>. If you can&#8217;t give me the former, that&#8217;s fine. But you must be able to give me the latter, or I can&#8217;t have you around. Because you will be helping the depression win.</p>\n<p>If you claim to be a friend or ally to me and yet don&#8217;t believe it is as bad as I say it is, if you minimize what I&#8217;m going through, if you refuse to listen to me when I speak of my life experience, then <strong>you are fighting on the side of the depression. You are supporting my illness, which is often terminal.</strong></p>\n<p>So it&#8217;s time to choose a side, because I&#8217;m no longer taking this lying down. I am not going to let the stigma against mental illness silence me anymore.</p>\n<p>I refuse to minimize my disease for the convenience of others. My disease is not convenient to me. You do not get that luxury where I lack it, and especially not at my expense.</p>\n<p><strong>The first step in being an ally to those of us suffering from depression or anxiety or anything similar is to put your convenience and your comfort aside.</strong> No, it is not convenient being friends with someone who has depression. Sometimes it is downright uncomfortable. But what is more uncomfortable is living in this skin, this skin that never sits right, that whispers lies to me, that I feel is transparent so everyone can see the monster inside. What is more inconvenient is having my depression ruin good things in my life because it destroys my ability to function. I get that it sucks you can&#8217;t have coffee with your friend. It sucks more that I just fucked up an entire month&#8217;s worth of work, leaving me scrambling to find rent at the end of the month.</p>\n<p><strong>Fight the minimization. Listen. Believe. Choose our side. Choose us.</strong></p>\n", "post_id": 4895, "location": false, "date": "03-31-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Bloodchild and other stories", "Medicine River", "Tuesdays with Morrie", "Thomas King", "Write.

They&#8217;ve both made their goals, but with more help they can make their stretch goals and make an ever bigger difference in the world.</p>\n<p>The first is <strong>Fattitude, a documentary by Lindsey Averill, exposing fat hatred and offering an alternative means of thinking.</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><b>WHY WE ARE MAKING THIS FILM</b>?</p>\n<p>We feel that most people are ill informed when it comes to fatness. We want to offer a counter argument to the current popular notions that condemn fatness in all forms, an argument that overturns notions of fat hatred in favor of body acceptance.</p>\n<p>The media and other cultural sources say that people need to lose weight &#8211; that obesity is a deadly epidemic, but there is scientific research that shows that weight loss and health are not linked like we think they are. For example, according to ASDAH, &#8220;Weight and BMI are poor predictors of disease and longevity. The bulk of epidemiological evidence suggests that five pounds \u201cunderweight\u201d is more dangerous than 75 pounds \u201coverweight.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>Lindsey has been attacked by fat-hating trolls and had herself, her husband, and her supporters dox&#8217;d just for daring to campaign for people to treat fat people like human beings. (Doxxing is when someone&#8217;s home address and phone number are posted publicly, online, with the express purpose of sending harassment that person&#8217;s way.) Having trolls attack en masse like that is terrifying, but Lindsey has stayed strong and now her campaign has been funded.</p>\n<p>I still think it deserves more backers, so if you&#8217;re inclined, <strong><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/319256879/fattitude-a-body-positive-documentary\">you can fund it here.</a></strong> (You have the option to put yourself as anonymous when you back it so you can&#8217;t be dox&#8217;d.)</p>\n<p>The second is <strong>Make Me a Radical Dietitian by Michelle Allison, aka <a href=\"http://www.fatnutritionist.com/\">The Fat Nutritionist</a>.</strong> Reading Michelle&#8217;s blog, in the early days of my coming to Fat Acceptance, helped me on the road to recovery with my eating disorders. She &#8212; more than anyone &#8212; let me know that it was safe to eat, that I was not a bad person for eating or not eating, that food was not a moral choice. Her blog told me I could make my own decisions about my food and I would not be wrong, because it&#8217;s <em>my body</em> and I know it best. I learned about intuitive eating from her and attempting to put it into practice is what has helped me start to recover from my disorders.</p>\n<p>I say <em>attempting</em> because I&#8217;m not perfect, and recovery is a journey, not a destination. I mess up, have slip ups, fall backwards. But I pick myself up and continue onwards. I am committed to my recovery.</p>\n<p><strong>If Michelle does this dietitian internship, she can help even more people like me.</strong> She will be given a bigger platform to do the good she does in the world. I think that&#8217;s worth supporting.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/make-me-a-radical-dietitian\">You can fund her here.</a></strong></p>\n<p>I myself plan on supporting both campaigns, assuming I get some money in the door in the next few days (and assuming I can decide on what perk I want; there are so many cool ones). <strong>If you feel the urge and you can, you should too. Signal boosting is also an awesome thing to do.</strong></p>\n<p>Campaigns like this, when successful, will help to make the world a safer place for people like me. This is why it&#8217;s so important to me that these campaigns reach their stretch goals. I want to someday live in a world where I am not on guard all the time, where I am not constantly fighting against fathatred, food shaming, people triggering my eating disorders. I want the world to be safe for me and for the next Katje who&#8217;s growing up, hating herself for eating, hating herself for not eating, and not receiving any support from the world around her.</p>\n<p>-Katje</p>\n<p>PS: Fat-hating comments will not be approved and the IPs will be blocked.

It&#8217;s weird because I still feel like she&#8217;s not really gone. I have to keep reminding myself: <em>no, really, she&#8217;s dead. Been for a while now.</em></p>\n<p>Eight years ago is when we started to face that we were going to lose her for good. For four years she went on a rollercoaster of &#8220;fine&#8221; to &#8220;at Death&#8217;s door, holding the knocker aloft&#8221; while my mom spent most of her life in Vancouver instead of Powell River, sleeping in the car, on the recliner, leaving Major, the dog, with me or taking him with her and keeping him on the down-low as much as she could, just so she could take care of her apparently dying mother. Doctors did nothing, instead prescribing so many conflicting medications it&#8217;s honestly a miracle they didn&#8217;t poison Oma to death. &#8220;It&#8217;s just diabetes symptoms,&#8221; they&#8217;d say, as we spent another week getting ready for her passing. It took those four years for her to finally get a diagnosis, in the summer of 2010: leukemia.</p>\n<p>By then, it was hospice time. Oma spent the last weeks of her life at Crossroads Hospice in Coquitlam, finally happy because she could actually <em>ask for pain medication and receive it</em> without being treated like a junkie. (No, really, they treat everyone looking for pain meds like junkies, even 90-something little old ladies who are obviously in so much pain they can barely walk into the doctor&#8217;s office.) Mom and Opa spent the last days with Oma &#8212; I was in Powell River holding down the fort.</p>\n<p>When it happened I got the call a little before 8pm. I had to scramble to find a way down to Vancouver by the next day so I could see Oma&#8217;s body before they cremated it. I needed that closure, which mom understood, so she had them hold on till I got there. I had to catch a ferry to the Island, drive down to Nanaimo, spend the night on a couch at the place I&#8217;d be living come September, and then get up as early as possible the next day to catch the first ferry over to Vancouver. I was sleep deprived and empty inside. I couldn&#8217;t feel any grief. I couldn&#8217;t feel anything.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d been taken to this threshold so many times but never brought over till that moment. All my grieving was bottled up inside me and it felt like it could never come out &#8212; like I&#8217;d shoved the cork in so tight, so many times, that I was stuck with no release.</p>\n<p>It still feels that way, though I am slowly releasing the grief. It comes out in little bits, every so often. That first year I would randomly cry a lot. I don&#8217;t so much anymore. I still have to search for ways to let go of her, little by little. I still am aching to find closure, pushing my shoulder against an old wooden door that sticks on the stones, creaks with every movement, giving centimeter by centimeter over more time than I want to give.</p>\n<p>June the 6th, after spending an all-nighter on a Pinterest binge of boards dedicated to DIY, organization, and <a href=\"http://www.unfuckyourhabitat.com/\">unfucking one&#8217;s habitat</a>, I decided to finally deal with the table of spices and soup mixes and gods know what else in my kitchen. All stuff I&#8217;d brought over from Oma&#8217;s old place, where it had sat since well before she&#8217;d died. Stuff she&#8217;d bought (or mom had bought for her). <em>Groentesoep</em> packages &#8212; what use did I have for vegetable soup with directions all in a language I can barely decipher on a good day? Why had I kept this stuff so long? I should have thrown it out when I first moved into Oma&#8217;s old place.</p>\n<p><strong>Easy answer there: sentiment.</strong> I couldn&#8217;t get rid of the various packages of Knorr soup, bouillon, soup mixes bought at the Holland Shop, or expired spices because <em>they had belonged to Oma</em>. They were evidence that she once kept a thriving kitchen, eight years or more ago. They were evidence of my childhood spent in that kitchen, making things with her, whether actual edible food or a soup made from almond soap (I was maybe 6 okay &#8212; it smelled good).</p>\n<p>These things were evidence of a lifetime spent at Oma&#8217;s house, eating dinner with her &#8212; they were evidence that she&#8217;d been there. And if I threw them out, I was closing the door a little bit more. Letting out some more grief. I wasn&#8217;t ready to do that.</p>\n<p>Until twelve days ago.</p>\n<p>I released the grief that was stuck in those soup packets and spice bottles. I&#8217;m not sure how I feel right now, but it&#8217;s better than empty.</p>\n<p>-Katje</p>\n", "post_id": 4919, "location": false, "date": "06-18-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["personal", "homeschooling", "not ALL USians!"], "text": "<p>Last month, <a href=\"http://www.hannahettinger.com/fuck-the-patriarchy-guest-post-by-clare/\">this post</a> and various posts relating to it made the rounds on the internet. I don&#8217;t think I need to tell you my reaction; if you&#8217;ve been paying attention at all you&#8217;ve figured out I&#8217;m a sex-positive feminist. What happened at that girl&#8217;s prom is bullshit.</p>\n<p>What interests me more right now is the reactions to the post. They&#8217;ve been varied, but something I&#8217;m seeing pop up now and again &#8212; and by &#8220;now and again&#8221; I mean &#8220;pretty often&#8221; &#8212; is the reaction of &#8220;It was a homeschool group, so of COURSE this makes sense &#8212; they&#8217;re all religious fundamentalist nuts.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In fact, it seems that nowadays whenever the word &#8220;homeschooling&#8221; is even <em>breathed</em> online people are quick to jump all over it as the worst experience ever: religiously repressive, misogynistic, downright abusive. And when I&#8217;ve responded to that with &#8220;That is not my experience at all, nor the experience of many of the other people I know who have been homeschooled,&#8221; it&#8217;s made clear that my experience doesn&#8217;t matter &#8212; because what <em>does</em> matter, apparently, is that people from the South and Eastern United States will <em>assume</em> all those horrible things when I say homeschooling. So I should prepare myself for their responses. Even after I&#8217;ve explained that&#8217;s <em>not</em> the universal experience. I understand, of course, that there ARE homeschooling cultures that are like that, but it&#8217;s not everywhere.</p>\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter that I explain this. The people with these reactions have already made up their minds. They have already decided that homeschooling is bad &#8212; and because they haven&#8217;t seen any evidence to the contrary (ie, people like me telling our stories), they have trouble believing it.</p>\n<p>I can&#8217;t speak for others with positive homeschooling experiences, but for myself I haven&#8217;t done any big reveal on it because&#8230;it was a good experience. I felt no need to process past events via writing, as I often do with my trauma and abuse. It was one of the good parts of my life. So, naturally, I tend to carry the assumption that if I do mention in passing I was homeschooled, or that I plan on homeschooling my kids, the first reaction from folks <strong>won&#8217;t</strong> be to jump on me and tell me homeschooling is awful and I should reconsider doing it because it is categorically awful, no exceptions ever. This is a logical assumption on my part: before the majority of my interactions were on the internet, they were in person, on the West Coast or Hawai&#8217;i &#8212; places where people don&#8217;t have those sorts of biases against homeschooling.</p>\n<p>Now, though, if I mention I was homeschooled I have to immediately launch into qualifications: &#8220;It&#8217;s <em>different</em> out west; it wasn&#8217;t religious at all; my mom is a Buddhist; it was totally secular.&#8221; And people still sideeye me like I&#8217;m the creature from the fundamentalist lagoon. Heavens forfend I mention wanting to homeschool (or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unschooling\">unschool</a>) my future spawn &#8212; then I&#8217;m a terrible parent who&#8217;s going to set up my children for years of therapy! Pretty impressive that I&#8217;m breaking all the Good Mom Rules, seeing as I&#8217;m not even a parent yet.</p>\n<p>So, can we stop? Can we stop with the POV of the South and Eastern United States as being the dominant narrative? And maybe the Midwest too; those terms are sort of nebulous to me, to be honest. One thing I do know, as a resident of the West: <strong>in conversations online with United Statesians further east from this coast, on <em>any</em> topic, more often than not my experiences and opinions are consistently dismissed.</strong> &#8220;Well it&#8217;s not the MAJORITY,&#8221; I get told. Because &#8220;majority&#8221; apparently equals not only USian, but <em>eastern</em> USian.</p>\n<p>(I see this sort of attitude directed towards west coasters in the US, too &#8212; not just Canadians. And yes, of course, not <em>every</em> eastern USian does this &#8212; but enough do that I&#8217;ve noticed a pattern. One that is tiring me out greatly.)</p>\n<p>Dear people who have been homeschooled in really sucky or even abusive situations:</p>\n<p>I am sorry. I <em>really</em> am. No one should ever have to go through that, and I understand you might have a kneejerk reaction to the word &#8220;homeschooling.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But it would be really, really great if you could remember that regional (and individual!) differences play a huge role in determining how much homeschooling is going to suck or not suck &#8212; and out West, at least in my experience, homeschooling is <em>largely</em> seen as a positive, secular experience done by forward-thinking parents.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not going to tell you your experience was positive, or your parents were forward-thinkers.

Ok, not clever, but not too terrible (except as being in the context of this horrible game).</p>\n<p>But then there are the ones that are directly related to pregnancy. Those really get my goat, because guess what many breast cancer survivors suffer as a result of their ordeal? Infertility.</p>\n<p>So you&#8217;ve got a bunch of people who don&#8217;t have breast cancer &#8220;raising awareness&#8221; about the disease by <em>lying</em> about being pregnant on Facebook. Maybe they&#8217;ve got friends who have survived, for whom that sort of message is painful, but they still want to be happy for their friend &#8212; so they post &#8220;congratulations!&#8221; and get in response that it&#8217;s just a <em>game</em>, you guys, to <em>raise awareness</em> of this <em>horrible disease</em>.</p>\n<p>If I were a breast cancer survivor suffering infertility and I saw that?

Why? Well, I&#8217;ve always felt intimidated by fatshion posts and have never wanted to do them before because I felt I would be found wanting. I&#8217;m not super trendy. I wear whatever I feel like wearing on any given day. A lot of my clothing is stained or ripped or just <em>old</em>; I&#8217;m not a person who can afford new pieces all that often and I&#8217;m not a person who <em>cares</em> if my clothing is ripped or stained. Is it still functional? Then I&#8217;m keeping it. The joke of &#8220;all it needs is a viable waistband!&#8221; that I hear men make about their underwear applies to my underwear as well &#8212; with the added &#8220;and enough fabric to conceivably stick a pad or panty liner to&#8221;. (This is something my hubs is constantly teasing me about, but he really doesn&#8217;t have a leg to stand on. We both have to go to specialty places &#8212; in his case, the bloody States, to find underwear that fits and is comfy. KEEP IT TILL IT DISINTEGRATES is the household motto.)</p>\n<p>So I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;d get chased out of fatshion circles for being an unkempt schlub.</p>\n<p>But, whatever. This isn&#8217;t fatshion circles &#8212; this is my blog. Where I can do whatever the fuck I want. So I&#8217;m starting this Friday post thing so that other fat people out there who don&#8217;t feel fashionable enough for the same reasons I don&#8217;t can see that you don&#8217;t have to be super cute or trendy to participate in fatshion &#8212; if you&#8217;re comfortable and happy, that&#8217;s all that matters! SCHLUBS UNITE</p>\n<p>Also this will make sure that I make an attempt to post here weekly.</p>\n<p>(And, I mean, I&#8217;m sure there are fatshion circles that are way inclusive of my &#8220;fashion&#8221;? Maybe? But I haven&#8217;t really seen any, and to be honest I find that so many places that talk about fashion <em>at all</em> start to get caught in that trap of shaming people for what they wear or snarking about their lack of fashion sense, or whatever, and I just really dislike that. So instead of moving in fashion circles and having to avoid those sorts of things, I&#8217;m just going to post here and Instagram and do my own thing and if you want to shame what I wear in the comments you will either be blocked or publicly mocked. Or both.)</p>\n<p>On with the fatshion!</p>\n<p><a title=\"#fatshionfriday overshirt: stolen from hubs. Undershirt: Costco camisole. Pants: thrifted.

Mr. Katje and I marathoned through several seasons and then got all caught up, and started catching episodes as they came out.</p>\n<p>If you asked us why we&#8217;ve stuck with it we&#8217;d likely respond with &#8220;Stockholm Syndrome.&#8221; The show is like a trainwreck: awful, but you can&#8217;t tear your eyes away. At some point the only characters on the show we weren&#8217;t constantly wishing death upon were Lafayette, Eric, and Terry. (Other characters had their moments but these 3 were the only ones we consistently did not hate.)</p>\n<p>All of the protagonists are stupid. The show is terribly written. They handle rape so awfully I should be surprised but sadly I am not. (Seriously, really really awful.)</p>\n<p>And yet we keep coming back. We&#8217;re addicted to it, like one gets addicted to V.</p>\n<p>So on that note, my thoughts on the first episode of the final\u00a0(thank gods) season. There be spoilers and a <strong>lot</strong> of swearing ahead; mind yerself. (though if you haven&#8217;t seen it my thoughts might not make much sense, anyway.)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How is Sookie not dead? She is literally the stupidest character I have ever seen. She really should have died sometime in Season 1, though honestly it was forgivable back then because she was so new to all this mortal danger stuff. Season 7 though? No excuse. No fucking excuse. Why are you walking home alone at night when ALL YOUR FRIENDS WERE JUST ATTACKED BY HEP-V VAMPS? What is WRONG with you? So your boyfriend had a less than charitable thought about you. Boohoo. That does not suddenly make it safe to walk home alone when there are hep-V vamps everywhere. Especially after you&#8217;ve wasted so much of your super magic fairy light because you&#8217;re\u00a0<em>stupid</em>. &#8220;Oh gee, here&#8217;s this one power I have that works against vampires who also think I&#8217;m catnip because I smell so good. I know, because my life is hard because of my mindreading powers I will TRY TO GET RID OF MY FAIRY POWERS SO I WILL BE DEFENSELESS. THIS IS A GOOD PLAN.&#8221; Jeez, girl. Take a vamp friend if you&#8217;re so pissed at Alcide. Really simple.</li>\n<li>Uh, way to screw Tara out of what she deserves yet\u00a0<em>again</em>, writers. Seriously, we get no death scene? You&#8217;re going to Greek tragedy this shit? Because of this I refuse to believe Tara is dead. REFUSE.</li>\n<li>They recast James, which is fine because apparently Luke Grimes didn&#8217;t want to stay on because his character is going to be doing ~*~gay stuff~*~ this season, pretty obviously set up in the scene between Lafayette and him. Also Luke Grimes has gone on to play Elliot Grey in<em> Fifty Shades of Grey</em> so, you know, have fun with that rape culture manifesto turned shitty movie, dude! (Abuse is fine but gay sex? OH THE HUMANITY.) Whatever; Nathan Parsons is\u00a0<em>much</em> hotter.</li>\n<li>Jessica what r u doing. You need to eat. What is wrong with you. You are setting yourself up for murdering the last of Andy&#8217;s fairy daughters here.</li>\n<li>Why doesn&#8217;t anyone get some crossbows with wooden-shafted bolts? Like, seriously. Jessica could have taken care of that Hep-V vamp in no time at all if she&#8217;d had a crossbow. Or, IDK, guns with WOODEN BULLETS? Seeing as their existence has been established. Guys it&#8217;s been 6 months since the Hep-V epidemic started, WHY HAVE YOU NOT ARMED YOURSELVES?</li>\n<li>I&#8217;m wondering if Bon Temps and Sunnydale are secretly the same place because everyone is in constant mortal danger and\u00a0<em>super stupid about it</em>.</li>\n<li>Why is everyone blaming Sookie again? Is it because she&#8217;s a terribly-written Mary Sue who is so special and ~*~different~*~ everyone\u00a0<em>has</em> to hate her or she&#8217;s not special enough? Is that it? Oh, it is. Okay then.</li>\n<li>What&#8230;why are these people forming a mob and blaming all the vamps again? Like, haven&#8217;t we worked through these issues? Haven&#8217;t we figured out that until the hep-V thing passes, y&#8217;all need vamps for protection? Are you, Mr. Ringleader, seriously\u00a0<em>that</em> upset about losing the mayoral race to Sam? &#8220;If I can&#8217;t run this town I&#8217;mma wreck it so YOU can&#8217;t run it!&#8221; Whyyyyyyyy, Bon Temps. Whyyyyyyy.</li>\n<li>Yeah, ok, Jason/Violet fucking on the car was pretty hot. High point of the episode probably.</li>\n<li>Ugh Alcide and Sookie are the most boring. couple. ever. Where the fuck did their chemistry go?</li>\n<li>There was a complete lack of Eric and not nearly enough Lafayette. In Terry&#8217;s absence, this is not acceptable. NEEDS MORE ERIC AND LAFAYETTE.</li>\n<li>Woooooow what a shitty, anticlimactic way to end an episode. Fuck you guys.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Honestly if it weren&#8217;t the last season we probably would have said &#8220;fuck this shit&#8221; at the end of season 6. So far season 7 is not off to a good start. Hopefully episode two won&#8217;t be\u00a0<em>so fucking boring.</em></p>\n<p>-Katje</p>\n", "post_id": 4945, "location": false, "date": "06-25-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["house shoes", "trip to India", "fatshion", "clothes"], "text": "<p><a title=\"#fatshionfriday June 28.

I&#8217;ve had it for most of my life &#8212; the test that shows the age level one&#8217;s auditory processing is at starts at age 5 and goes to age 18, but we are fairly certain my deficit started when I was 2 years old. Trauma can often be the cause of these sorts of deficits, and there was a doozy of one directly associated with hearing and listening when I was two. (I&#8217;m not getting into the story right now. I might at some point in the future.)</p>\n<p>Before I took the test, mom thought I was just being a teenager with selective hearing. She&#8217;d have to repeat herself several times before I would remember what she said. I explained that I wasn&#8217;t forgetting or mishearing things on purpose; it was just that I literally had no memory of her saying certain things.</p>\n<p>When I took the test she realized it was an actual problem, so we took steps to fix it. The test, called the Gibson Cognitive Test Battery, is part of a program called <a href=\"http://www.cognitiontherapy.org/\">PACE &#8212; Processing And Cognitive Enhancement.</a> It tests several areas of processing and function in the brain &#8212; the framework upon which you put content learning. Auditory processing, memory, visual processing, and other areas are tested. Often people who bottom out in one area will max out in another, because it&#8217;s their brain&#8217;s way of coping. I had maxed out on visual processor and a few other areas.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a program my mom does, and she&#8217;s damn good at it. I did the program with her, though I didn&#8217;t get the full benefit. Ideally PACE is done quickly &#8212; the 36 hours within a few weeks &#8212; because this ensures the most advancement for the brain. Because mom had other students and I was in theatre we were both so busy we rarely had time for PACE sessions. We did the program over 2 years, often sitting for several hours in a session, determined to get as much done in one sitting as possible. For the longest time I held the record for levels passed in a session &#8212; not hard when your sessions are 7 hours long.</p>\n<p>Still, even though it took us 2 years to do the program, I came up several ages in the areas I was lacking. When we were done I was age 16 in auditory processing &#8212; that was an advancement of 11 years (14 if we accept that the deficit was lower than 5 and likely at 2 years of age).</p>\n<p>We tested me again recently and I have somehow made it up to age 18. However, I still struggle with remembering things that are said, and when I&#8217;m stressed or tired my processing goes down the tubes. (It also does not help that Mr. Katje is an avowed mumbler.)</p>\n<p><strong>It&#8217;s important to note that auditory processing is not a hearing problem.</strong> It is not a physical problem with the mechanisms for hearing things &#8212; my ears work fine (with the exception of the constant tinnitus). It is a problem with my brain &#8212; specifically the area used to process sounds.</p>\n<p>However, so few people are even aware of auditory processing deficit as an actual <em>thing</em> that when explaining why I don&#8217;t listen to podcasts or why someone has to repeat something to me a few times to make sure I remember I often default to saying &#8220;I have a hearing problem,&#8221; even though I don&#8217;t. I can hear you just fine. Unfortunately, my ears don&#8217;t always give my brain the memo &#8212; especially when I&#8217;m stressed, or when the words are said in certain tones (because said tones stress me out). And these days I&#8217;m pretty much always stressed.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s honestly pretty shitty having this. School has been a struggle since high school, and last time I asked a teacher to slow down because he was speaking a mile a minute and I needed extra time to process, he said &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you try just <em>listening</em>?&#8221; (As if I wasn&#8217;t.) I explained the processing deficit and he and the entire class laughed in my face. That was in University, by the way, but this wasn&#8217;t the first time I was treated like that for having learning disabilities. (I was in Special Ed throughout high school and I swear, the fact that my mom kept fighting for me to get certain help in school was the <em>only</em> reason I graduated. If it weren&#8217;t for my mom I would have dropped out.)</p>\n<p>Because the test that shows the deficit isn&#8217;t considered an official source by most schools I often can&#8217;t get any concessions for classes. This, combined with my other learning disabilities, depression, anxiety, and more recently physical disability, ensured that it took me 10 years to get my Bachelors instead of 4.</p>\n<p>There are tons of podcasts I&#8217;d really like to listen to regularly, but I can&#8217;t because podcast listening for me entails sitting stock still and concentrating very hard on everything being said. It&#8217;s exhausting, and soon my mind starts to wander and then I need to rewind and find my place again.</p>\n<p>Also it contributes to lack of communication with people I love, which creates fights. Just the other day I thought Mr. Katje said something that he didn&#8217;t, and we fought for over an hour over it. I misheard a sentence because I was really tired and my processing skills weren&#8217;t up to par, and he was mumbling more than usual that day. We made up, and talked it out, and all is forgiven &#8212; but I hate fighting with him and for that hour we were both miserable.</p>\n<p>But, like with all things I have to live with, I learn to cope. I&#8217;ve done what I can to bring up my auditory processing to a manageable level, and I&#8217;m planning on doing PACE again with mom &#8212; maybe it&#8217;ll improve some more. In the meantime, I accept that I might always have problems processing what people say, and I work harder to keep it from adversely affecting my life too much.</p>\n<p>In return, I only ask for a little patience from my loved ones.</p>\n<p>So next time I need to ask you to repeat yourself, or I don&#8217;t remember what you say, please don&#8217;t take it personally. It&#8217;s just my super fucked up brain making my life a little more difficult. (So<em> original</em>, brain.

It is a matter of fact telling of things that happened to me and how much they fucking suck. </em></p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>As most of you know, I have a spinal injury. It happened, I believe, in 2009, but somehow didn&#8217;t flare up till 2012. Bodies are weird. I&#8217;m quite sure it was 2009 because that&#8217;s the only time it could have happened &#8212; there was a drunken theatre party and a few of my compatriots decided to start wrestling and landed on my head. I felt my entire spine compress, a line of loud <em>pops</em> ringing out from my neck to my pelvis.</p>\n<p>The pain was short-lived, so I didn&#8217;t think much of the incident. The fact that afterwards I started feeling a new pain in my lower back whenever I walked uphill or anywhere for a long period of time was easily ignored: I&#8217;ve had chronic back pain since I was 9 or 10. This was obviously just a new permutation of it. I ignored it.</p>\n<p>It was in January, 2012, after I got home from my trip to Orlando, Florida, that the spinal injury finally made its presence fully known &#8212; 3 bulging discs in the lumbar region &#8212; and I became a self-proclaimed cripple. (Was it the rides I went on at Universal Studios that finally tripped the back into full blown agony? Or was it the 3 feet of snow I had to drag my heavy, Harry Potter-merchandise-laden suitcase through when I got home to cold Nanaimo? We may never know.)</p>\n<p>I was bedridden for weeks and it was only with physiotherapy was I able to walk again, albeit with a cane. I completed my theatre show, knowing it would likely be my last. I adore acting and I always give 110% to any role I&#8217;m in. The reality of my life post-injury is that I must always be careful, and I cannot trust myself to be careful if I&#8217;m in a show. Whatever the director asks for, I will do. I cannot set boundaries; I sacrifice myself on Dionysos&#8217; altar.</p>\n<p>I stopped going to physiotherapy &#8212; not because I was done with it, or because I wanted to stop, but because it&#8217;s not covered by MSP and I have no extra insurance. Each visit is in the ballpark of 50 dollars, and I would have to go a few times a week for several months to get the sort of results &#8212; back to a degree of normal living &#8212; that I want.</p>\n<p>Instead I&#8217;ve tried to remain as active as my back will allow me to be, and kept as positive a worldview as I can. I was suicidally depressed during my weeks of being bedridden, crying into my mother&#8217;s arms about how my life was ruined and I would never be the same. My <em>youth</em> was over &#8212; something I felt I never really had in the first place; a childhood cut short by the trauma of an abusive father and an 11-year long divorce. My 20s was when I started to reclaim some of what I&#8217;d lost, and now that, too, was cut short, by a body that was broken.</p>\n<p>But I had come to a point where I was finally starting to feel better about my different life, and I had begun a job search for work outside the home &#8212; something I didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d be able to do again. (I get zero assistance, even though I&#8217;m permanently disabled.) Maybe after I got a job I would even be able to afford physiotherapy, I dreamed. Maybe within 6 months I would be able to walk <em>without</em> the cane.</p>\n<p>Then on Friday, July 4th &#8212; Independence Day! The irony burns &#8212; after coming home from driving Mr. Katje to pick up his truck from the mechanic&#8217;s, I slipped and fell in the kitchen. My leg twisted severely, and I was racked with pain so terrible I screamed uncontrollably for 5 minutes.</p>\n<p>Mr. Katje, of course, was not home &#8212; I was about 10 minutes ahead of him on the road as he&#8217;d pulled over to check something out with the car. Our landlady, a nurse, heard my screams and came downstairs to help me to a sitting position. She went and grabbed a kitchen chair from upstairs &#8212; the only chairs we have are rolly ones, not suitable for this sort of thing &#8212; and by the time she came back downstairs Mr. Katje was home. I was sitting on the floor, shaking and crying (silently, thank gods), still in agony.</p>\n<p>With their help I got onto the chair, and again with their help I got to a recliner in the living room. We put the leg up and iced the knee, which had then swollen exponentially. I was still in tremendous pain, even sitting still, so Mr. Katje brought me some of my Tramadol and some Ibuprofen. (The Tramadol I have for especially bad back pain days, though I try not to take it unless I&#8217;m basically unable to move without it.)</p>\n<p>About an hour later the pain lessened to the point where I could distract myself with TV. Mr. Katje ran around getting me things, including two of my three canes. I used them as makeshift crutches to get around the house, as I could not put any weight whatsoever on my left leg. My right leg started to protest at being used so roughly and threatened to join a union.</p>\n<p>I could barely make it from the recliner to the bathroom, and bending my leg too far or straightening it too much was agony. We decided I need to go to the hospital, but by the time the decision was made it was dark outside, and rainy. I would have to bum up the stairs that lead down to our front door, so we decided to wait until the next day. I would sleep in the recliner. We also wanted to see if the swelling and pain would go down.</p>\n<p>It didn&#8217;t. We began to believe I had fractured a bone &#8212; a preferable outcome, truth be told. A fractured bone would mean 6-8 weeks in a cast and a relatively short recovery time afterwards. A torn ligament, meniscus, or tendon could possibly mean surgery and certainly months of physiotherapy &#8212; physiotherapy I definitely wouldn&#8217;t be able to afford without a job outside the house, which I definitely can&#8217;t get now that I can&#8217;t walk.</p>\n<p>We slept most of the day, still on Mr. Katje&#8217;s night schedule, and started to leave the house for the hospital sometime around 6:30, 7pm. We didn&#8217;t arrive until 8pm. It is a 20 minute drive. That should give you an idea of how long it took to get me to the truck.</p>\n<p>At 8:30 we were finally able to check in at ER. Eventually we got to see a triage nurse who took my blood pressure and asked various questions, then we were directed to another person who confirmed or changed my contact info. We were then told to wait in the waiting area for a doctor to see us.</p>\n<p>At 11:30 pm we were finally called in. By that point, my leg had started to hurt a lot again &#8212; I couldn&#8217;t put it up anywhere, and it was bent too severely in the wheelchair I sat in. Something in the knee was moving around. It felt like my kneecap was dislocated but I don&#8217;t know if that was the case. All I know was that I was crying from the pain and terrified to relax my muscles, lest the leg move too much and something slid around again.</p>\n<p>The place were called into was another waiting room. Sometime before 1am we were brought into a treatment room and I was lifted onto a stretcher. As my legs were brought up and the leg straightened out, that horrible grinding and moving sensation happened again and I started sobbing and crying loudly, shouting <em>Ow ow ow ow oh gods make it stop please oh gods no ow ow ow</em>. Finally the movement ceased, and I was left to lie on the stretcher, staring up at a fluorescent light and trying to disassociate while I wondered if amputation was an option.</p>\n<p>Someone came in to give me painkillers. I told them very emphatically, several times, not to give me morphine because I react badly to it and hate it, so they gave me hydromorphone instead &#8212; morphine&#8217;s cousin and 8 times stronger. They also gave me a shot of gravol to help with the nausea. I assume it did, because I only vomited 3 times instead of 8 or 10 (as many times as I did the last time I got morphine).</p>\n<p>Luckily the vomiting didn&#8217;t occur until after I was done with xrays, and the painkillers did help me get through that experience, where I had to move my leg about in various positions so they could get good pictures. Mr. Katje stayed with me through most of it, though he wasn&#8217;t allowed in the x-ray room, and as they wheeled me back to the treatment area I looked up at him and told him he was pretty. I was pretty godsdamn high from the painkillers.</p>\n<p>We were wheeled into a treatment room. After I dozed and had semi-hallucinations for a bit, I asked Mr. Katje to get a nurse to bring up the stretcher so I could sit up, as lying down was bad for my back, and to also bring some sick bowls because the nausea was getting pretty bad. He also did me the courtesy of closing the curtain to our treatment area so no other patients would see me vomit, though they most assuredly heard it.</p>\n<p>(Morphine-induced sickness is the worst, for me. It&#8217;s the kind that takes complete control of your body and leaves you feeling like someone with brass knuckles just punched you repeatedly in the diaphragm. It usually leaves me crying and begging for it to stop. Hydromorphone-induced sickness was no different.)</p>\n<p>During this time I also discovered that hydromorphone makes my nose incredibly itchy. I could not stop rubbing my nose, trying to dispel the itch. It was like someone was using an electric toothbrush on me as torture.</p>\n<p>Mr. Katje, sitting beside me, researched the drug on his phone and told me the stats. He then said, &#8220;So apparently you just can&#8217;t have opioids. No heroin for you!&#8221;</p>\n<p>I wasn&#8217;t planning on it.</p>\n<p>The doctor then came in and told me a semi-diagnosis &#8212; that is, the x-rays revealed no broken bones, so he thinks it&#8217;s a torn Medial Collateral Ligament, or the ligament on the inside of the knee. The fact that I can&#8217;t walk at all means it&#8217;s probably pretty severe. I have to go in in a week to see a different doctor, to whom I am getting a referral, and then I&#8217;ll get a better idea of the diagnosis and prognosis.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, we got an immobilizer for my leg, which is basically a soft cast, and some crutches. They make it so I can hobble around a lot easier, and I was even able to get down the stairs at home on my feet, more or less.</p>\n<p>We left the hospital at 2am. Mr. Katje had to wheel me out to the car, however, as I was still so incredibly high from the painkillers I couldn&#8217;t make it very far on the crutches without stumbling or vomiting. We got fast food for dinner, because neither of us had eaten in about 24 hours and we didn&#8217;t want to go home and cook &#8212; well, Mr. Katje would be cooking while I sat in my recliner and tried not to throw up.</p>\n<p>Luckily the food settled my stomach and I wasn&#8217;t sick for the rest of the night.</p>\n<p>We got home at about 2:45, 3, and by 3:30 I was sitting in my recliner again. I was still pretty drugged until I woke up today at 7pm, and I&#8217;m guessing the drugs are what made me sleep so much.</p>\n<p>The immobilizer, while a miracle that helps me function somewhat, at least enough so I can survive while Mr. Katje is at work this week, is a thick, hot, monstrosity which I cannot take off nor get wet. It also keeps sliding down, so every so often we need to re-tighten the velcro straps &#8212; when it was put on me at the hospital it was no where near tight enough so when I was crutching myself to the front door, it was sliding down my leg and resting on my sandal. I told them to pull super tight &#8212; the fat squishes and at that point I wasn&#8217;t feeling anything &#8212; but they didn&#8217;t. Mr. Katje had to re-do it when we got inside.</p>\n<p>The most we can do is loosen the straps a bit so my leg can breathe, and then tighten them up again. I have to be careful not to move when the straps are loosened. I&#8217;m not able to shower for a while, so a washcloth and the bathroom sink are keeping me from overpowering the house with the smell of B.O.</p>\n<p>At this point, we don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s in store. I&#8217;ll likely have to be off my feet for a few weeks at least, and physiotherapy is probably a definite. Whether or not I need surgery remains to be seen.</p>\n<p>The hard, sad truth that I must accept, however, is that this is forever. Once you injure your knee like this, it&#8217;s very likely to happen again. Mr. Katje&#8217;s brother-in-law has injured his ligaments 2 or 3 times. I&#8217;m looking at a life of being extremely careful lest I re-injure my knee <em>or</em> my back.</p>\n<p>The irony is, when I started to fall in the kitchen I panicked and tried not to fall &#8212; because a fall could be catastrophic for my back. Yet if I had just gone rag-doll limp, I might not have injured my knee so severely.</p>\n<p>My injuries have made me a creature of spun glass. I must always be careful now, lest I break.</p>\n<p>I have always been an optimistic person, but at this moment in time all optimism has fled me. I cannot find a plus side to this. I do not want to be an inspiration in my positivity in the face of adversity. I do not want people to remind me &#8220;how lucky I am&#8221; because at least before the injury I had a few years of a semi-working body; I do not want my situation to be compared to others in worse positions, as if I&#8217;m not allowed to mourn the loss of my life. I do not want to &#8220;Think positive!&#8221; because there is nothing positive about this. My body is broken, and my spirit has gone with it.</p>\n", "post_id": 4955, "location": false, "date": "07-07-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["excruciating pain", "publishing", "Mr. Katje", "personal", "broken leg", "work", "disability", "writing", "injured knee", "plaster cast", "Stargate SG-1", "editing", "injuries", "Depression"], "text": "<p>In about 6 hours I have an appointment with a doctor at the hospital&#8217;s cast clinic.

Turns out I do have a break &#8212; a femoral condyle fracture. I broke my femur.</p>\n<p>However, I still don&#8217;t know if I <em>also</em> have tendon or ligament tears or if all the excruciating pain was from the fracture. There is also still the issue of the slipping/grinding noise/pain that happened that night at emerge when my knee was bent for too long. Since then my leg has been kept straight by the immobilizer, so it hasn&#8217;t happened again, but I&#8217;ll be asking the doctor about it. I don&#8217;t want a possible bone dislocation or something else to get missed.</p>\n<p>If it is <em>just</em> a broken bone, then things have improved dramatically. Yes, my summer is still ruined, and yes I&#8217;ll still have to spend my birthday in a cast, at home, likely stinky from lack of regular showering (I showered on Monday with the help of Mr. Katje; I doubt I&#8217;ll have the energy to do so more than once a week, leastwise not until I&#8217;m able to get the shower seat from Oma&#8217;s old place). If there&#8217;s no ligament damage, I won&#8217;t be facing quite as much physiotherapy as before thought.</p>\n<p>But I still don&#8217;t know. And until I know, I&#8217;m not letting myself get too optimistic. The fact is regardless the full extent of the injury, I&#8217;m going to be down and out for the next several months. Recovery, whether incredibly long with a torn ligament or comparatively short with just a fracture, is still going to be long, slow, and hard.</p>\n<p>In the meantime I have fallen into a deep depression over this. I feel useless and helpless and like a burden, and I hate feeling these things. When it was just a spinal injury I wasn&#8217;t the <em>most</em> active of people, but I could still do my part. I was in pain daily but I could <em>move about</em> and <em>get things done</em>. Now the most I can do is sit around in a recliner all day, trying not to move my leg too much in the immobilizer-that-doesn&#8217;t-immobilize.</p>\n<p>I am trying to fling myself into writing, editing, and publishing &#8212; useful, productive things I <em>can</em> do. It hasn&#8217;t cured the depression but it does distract me from it for a little while.</p>\n<p>Distraction is currently my best weapon against despair. Instead of sitting and staring into space, thinking about how much this fucking sucks, I open my computer and work, or turn on the TV and watch <em>Stargate </em>and let the absolute adorableness of Teal&#8217;c carry me away from my problems.</p>\n", "post_id": 4958, "location": false, "date": "07-10-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["stories: The Jade Star of Athering", "Mr. Katje", "personal", "broken leg", "writing life", "writing", "gywo", "stories: Stranger Skies", "books", "plaster cast", "Stargate SG-1", "stories: Bellica", "Kaimana Wolff"], "text": "<p>The title is better if you imagine it being read in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzyd91NFx-Y\">Comic Book Guy&#8217;s voice</a>.</p>\n<p>Long and short of my trip to the cast clinic is yes, I have a broken femur, there is apparently no tendon or ligament damage, and no, I cannot have a plaster cast, <em>because my leg is shaped weird</em>.</p>\n<p>Yes, you read that right: I have a weird leg.

But basically, no nothing for Katje until the end of August.</p>\n<p>I have some projects to keep me busy while I&#8217;m stuck without a working leg. A big one is <strong>writing</strong>.

My &#8220;that was a depressing waste of energy&#8221; face.</p></div>\n<p>It&#8217;s not easy. I feel that&#8217;s one way The Doctor is very much like regular doctors &#8212; give you a straight answer when you ask a question? MADNESS</p>\n<p>But, finally, I did. Yesterday, at my follow-up appointment at the cast clinic. After he told me that I&#8217;d probably have to be in the brace and off my feet until October, basically (so, a bit longer than originally thought), I finally got an answer regarding the possibility of ligament or meniscus damage:</p>\n<p><strong>They don&#8217;t know.</strong></p>\n<p>They won&#8217;t know until my fracture is healed up, because they can&#8217;t do an examination to figure out if the ligaments or meniscus are damaged without risking further damage to the fracture. So in several weeks, I may get an answer to that question.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m guessing it&#8217;s going to be &#8220;Yes, your knee is damaged,&#8221; mostly because my knee still feels like it&#8217;s been smashed with a hammer and I can&#8217;t bend my leg without extreme pain.</p>\n<p>But apparently the reason they kept avoiding my questions about the knee was because they didn&#8217;t know and couldn&#8217;t tell me for a while. Which is all I wanted to know! Just <em>an</em> answer, any answer.</p>\n<p>So now I know it&#8217;s still on the table, the possibility of more severe damage, and I just have to wait and see what happens. And in the meantime, don&#8217;t put any pressure on the broken leg.</p>\n<p>This weekend we&#8217;re picking up a wheelchair for me and maybe getting me a proper shower at the in-laws&#8217; place. If I&#8217;m up to it, Mr. Katje might even take me out for dinner at our favourite restaurant.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m honestly pretty excited about the wheelchair. Apparently it has a leg rest on the left hand side, which already makes it a million times better than those stupid hospital wheelchairs. (Yes, I totally have the muscle strength to just hover my leg straight out the entire time I&#8217;m in that thing. Not.)</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t mean to sound bitter about our experience with BC medical this time around. I&#8217;m getting the help I need. I&#8217;m just frustrated and tired of being cooped up in a chair 24/7, and looking at another 2 months of being cooped up like this.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 330px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a title=\"Book has been proofed, as of last night. now to change the files and ship em off. by Kat van Loon, on Flickr\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/katjevanloon/14542119137\"><img src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5572/14542119137_e51ece1232_n.jpg\" alt=\"Book has been proofed, as of last night. now to change the files and ship em off.\" width=\"320\" height=\"320\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">I think I went through 5 stacks of post-it notes.</p></div>\n<p>So, I&#8217;m trying to set my brain to productivity. Namely, edits, rewrites, and writing fresh words (and, on the other side of the business: publishing). I&#8217;m just finishing up the work for a book by Kaimana Wolff, called<em> Broken Sleep</em>. It&#8217;s a really good book, even if the subject matter is hard for me to take. I said in my review that it&#8217;s a harrowing expos\u00e9 of abuse, and I stand by that. It needed a lot of proofing, though, as you can no doubt tell by the picture. Right now it&#8217;s on round 3 of proofs. I&#8217;m waiting to hear back from the author, and then I can finish up work on it.</p>\n<p>If you want to get an ebook ARC &#8212; advance reading copy &#8212; <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1DaCVFGhhHocFiHkUwNVocHI19LDiU-O0IC-sLW6cIVE/viewform?usp=send_form\">you can sign up for one here</a>. They will be sent out as soon as I&#8217;m done with the ebook formatting.</p>\n<p>Regarding my own writing, currently I&#8217;m working hard on <em>The Jade Star of Athering. </em>When I started re-writes there were 9 entirely new parts I had to write. Now there are 4, along with the various continuity edits and smaller rewrites within the finished chapters. <strong>For the record, editing and re-writing <em>Jade Star</em> has been like trying to marathon through a swamp filled with eels and unspeakable horrors.</strong> I am never doing vomit-out-words-and-fix-it-in-post writing again &#8212; after this, I&#8217;m going back to the much-more-natural-for-me edit-as-I-go style of writing. Fixing it in post is torture.</p>\n<p>After I finish my edits and rewrites, I&#8217;ll be sending off the manuscript to my editor for the first round of edits. When she&#8217;s done, it&#8217;ll be time for beta readers to have at it. Once I&#8217;ve implemented beta feedback, it goes for its final round of edits, and then I start the publishing process. It&#8217;s at this point I release an ARC for advance readers. During the publishing process, we proof the manuscript several more times (and likely find more errors). Hopefully by the time release day rolls around there are no more errors left. (I say <em>hopefully,</em> because we are human.)</p>\n<p>When <em>Jade Star</em> is off with the editor and beta readers, I&#8217;ll be focusing on finishing up the first draft of <em>From the Ashes</em>, sequel to <em>Stranger Skies</em>. I have a deadline of the end of the year to finish the first draft, but if I&#8217;m lucky I&#8217;ll get it done sooner.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve got a lot of writing projects planned out for the next year or so. I really want to finish <em>Jade Star</em> and <em>From the Ashes</em> soon because I have another book I&#8217;m starting in November &#8212; <em>Anala</em>, the sequel to <em>Jade Star</em> and third book in The Third Age. It&#8217;s going to need to be outlined very carefully, however, as it happens during the same time period as Book 4 (which is so far untitled).</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a lot more on my plate, writing wise, but if I outlined my entire year&#8217;s plan here then I&#8217;d have no choice but to stick with it and I like to give myself some leeway for failure. (Insert winky face here.) Accountability is great, so long as I&#8217;m making myself publicly accountable for things I know I can accomplish.</p>\n<p>So right now it&#8217;s just a matter of keeping busy with what matters to me, which thankfully is something I can still do while I have a broken leg. I have to be grateful for that &#8212; my passion doesn&#8217;t involve using my leg. I can still work on it even when injured and chair-ridden.</p>\n<p>-Katje</p>\n<p>PS: <strong>If you want to be first to hear about release dates, tours, events, etc for both my mother and me, then <a href=\"http://eepurl.com/XTQ-1\">you should sign up for our mailing list</a>.</strong> It comes out about once a month, and it gives you the opportunity to sign up to receive ARCs before anyone else can, or to pre-order first.

I think even abstract concepts like &#8220;life&#8221; or &#8220;the universe&#8221; have limits on how much bullshit from one person they can tolerate.</li>\n<li>Lafayette is still one of the most down to earth, practical, straight forward, feet on the damn ground characters in this show and I truly do appreciate him. Also his sass cannot be outmatched by anyone.</li>\n<li>Hooray, more stupid assholes stirring up drama for no damn reason! What? Sam is a politician you can&#8217;t trust? OH MY GAWD, NO WAY. A POLITICIAN LIED? How _weird_!</li>\n<li>Ugh, Charles Percy, of course you&#8217;re part of this. I still don&#8217;t forgive you for how you treated Izzie.</li>\n<li>Using Fae powers for good! Hooray! Perhaps Adilyn will be smarter about this shit than Sookie is. (Yes, Sookie has used her powers for good, but she&#8217;s also been very stupid about the whole thing.)</li>\n<li>Why is everyone in this town dead? Why didn&#8217;t they just stay indoors at night until the Hep V vamps all died? Why did they let them inside? Why did they answer the door? WHY IS EVERYONE IN THIS WORLD TERMINALLY STUPID?</li>\n<li>Seriously, Kenya? You&#8217;re going to allow the fact you&#8217;ve been passed over for promotion drag you into mob rule? Yes, racism and sexism SUCK and you&#8217;re probably totally right that&#8217;s why you got passed over for promotion but I _think_ the Hep V vamps are a bigger problem right now? Maybe? Just maybe? And mob rule isn&#8217;t going to help anyone? Hello? ::tap-tap:: Is this thing on?</li>\n<li>Sorry Jessica, you chose a really stupid friend. No getting a hold of her because phones are for trees!</li>\n<li>Oh gods I hope Hoyt&#8217;s mom dies this season.</li>\n<li>How were they taken in the middle of pizza dinner? Did they hear the doorbell ring and go &#8220;Oh hey, that must be the Hep V vamps, let&#8217;s go answer the door and let them eat us!&#8221;</li>\n<li>Pizza forensics. Best.</li>\n<li>Waaah, so tragic and sad these people are dead! Even though they were terminally stupid.</li>\n<li>Jason you are terrible at keeping house. Who flings a pizza on the piano? Seriously.</li>\n<li>Sookie reading mystery dead girl&#8217;s diary about her romance with a vampire totally not ham-handed way of shoving in her ~*~true feelings for Bill~*~ in at all. Nope no hamhandedness here, nope. (Alcide notices how this affects you, Sookie. You are not hiding anything.)</li>\n<li>Oh Jesus, now we get flashbacks. ::gets barf-bag::</li>\n<li>&#8220;How could this be happening? How could our government be leaving us for dead?&#8221; Because you&#8217;re too stupid to stay indoors?</li>\n<li>Ok so apparently this season is set 3 years ago. Weird. That is a brain-fuck.</li>\n<li>I didn&#8217;t think Lettie Mae could get worse, but she did. Seriously though, I am worried for this woman&#8217;s state of mind. Has anyone considered, I don&#8217;t know, gently convincing her to go to therapy?</li>\n<li>Let sleeping vampires lie, Lettie Mae. It&#8217;s like poking a sleeping bear for fuck&#8217;s sake.</li>\n<li>That is some _subtle_ imagery there, with Tara on a cross, speaking in tongues, and a giant snake wrapped around her. Very subtle.</li>\n<li>So is Arlene infected with Hep V then? Because, you know, Betty died super quick after biting into her and drinking.</li>\n<li>&#8230;yes, Sookie, prove even more how stupid you are. Seriously. What. HAVE YOU HEARD OF A TELEPHONE oh wait that&#8217;s right YOU FLUNG IT AWAY augh why do I even bother anymore, go ahead, go walking alone after sundown, maybe you&#8217;ll get eaten this time (we can only hope).</li>\n<li>Oh shit, no. Not Eric. Fuck you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Episode 2 was possibly less boring than episode 1? I don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s hard to tell. Also, I called it Gay Blood because of the starting scene and the running theme of James/Lafayette. This is a positive thing, in my view. I think <em>True Blood</em> needs more gay. MOAR GAY PLS</p>\n<p>(All of TV needs more gay. And more bi. And more trans*. Just more QUILTBAG in general, please.)</p>\n<p>See you tomorrow for episode 3.</p>\n<p>-Katje</p>\n", "post_id": 4970, "location": false, "date": "08-07-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["True Blood"], "text": "<p>And we begin another episode.

We have to work hard at it. Really make sure we&#8217;re getting everything we can out of the time we waste.</p>\n<p>After feeling awful for over two weeks because I haven&#8217;t been writing or editing, I finally got down to working on <em>The Jade Star of Athering</em> again today. I thought that working on it would make me feel better &#8212; and you know, it has. I&#8217;ve worked on it for maybe 20 minutes and written about 150 new words in it. Now I&#8217;m feeling &#8220;Okay, I worked on this, can I quit and do something else now?&#8221; <em>That</em> sort of &#8216;feeling better&#8217;.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the thing with <em>The Jade Star of Athering</em>. I set myself up for editing failure with it.</p>\n<p>My natural writing state is to write a bunch and go back and edit it before moving on. I am an edit-as-I-goer. That was how I did <em>Bellica</em>, and while <em>Bellica</em> took way too much time, its finished first draft was about 10x cleaner than its sequel&#8217;s first draft.</p>\n<p>I started doing <em>Jade Star</em> that way, too. It is, as I said, my natural state.</p>\n<p>But then I published <em>Bellica</em> and became active in online indie author circles and started reading all this advice and&#8230;somewhere along the way I internalized the idea that the point was to get it written and edit it later. <em>I&#8217;LL FIX IT IN POST,</em> my brain drunkenly screamed as I tried like hell to finish my first drafts. <em>THIS IS A GOOD IDEA</em>, it further said, swigging some vodka (I don&#8217;t know where my brain got the vodka) before knocking over a lamp.</p>\n<p>This worked out okay for <em>Stranger Skies</em>, which was fully plotted before I wrote it (and therein lies the difference, likely). I say <em>okay</em>, because editing <em>Stranger Skies</em> was still like dragging my carcass through a swamp made of death and tears in a way that editing <em>Bellica</em> wasn&#8217;t.</p>\n<p>And now editing <em>The Jade Star of Athering</em> is turning out to be even worse.</p>\n<p>Part of my issues are related to Fear of the Sequel, yes &#8212; I won&#8217;t deny that. There lurks a fear in me that I can only do great first books and whatever book is next in the series will fall short. Which is fair, as it&#8217;s basically a trope now that Sequels Always Suck, so it makes sense I&#8217;d feel that way about my own work (whether or not it&#8217;s true). But mostly, the big wall that keeps springing up is the fact that this finished first draft is the messiest pile of crap I have ever produced. And that&#8217;s because I absorbed &#8220;Don&#8217;t get it right, get it written&#8221; when I was finishing it.</p>\n<p>Look, &#8220;Don&#8217;t get it right, get it written&#8221; is actually <em>great advice</em> for people who are not natural edit-as-we-goers. If you are the type of writer who works better editing after the first draft is done, then yes, absolutely, vomit those words onto the page and make it pretty, make it make sense, later. Do it, because it works for you.</p>\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t work for me. And that&#8217;s a lesson I&#8217;ve learned, now, and I won&#8217;t repeat this mistake in the future. When I&#8217;m finished <em>The Jade Star of Athering</em> &#8212; which was supposed to be at the beginning of this month, by the way, and now it&#8217;s looking like I&#8217;ll have to push the release date &#8212; I&#8217;ll be working on <em>From the Ashes</em>, the next book in The Borderlands Saga. And I&#8217;m going to let my natural inclination to edit as I go take the lead, this time.</p>\n<p><strong>How to procrastinate:</strong> let writing advice override your natural inclination for editing as you go. Finish a first draft. Try to edit that first draft.

But I don&#8217;t know where to begin.</p>\n<p>Do I begin at the beginning (for me) &#8212; when I was 2 and encountered severe trauma related to food? When I was screamed at for getting dessert on Christmas, when I was so upset I threw up all my food?</p>\n<p>That is where it started for me, my rocky relationship with food. Imagine, being told by your loving mother you can have a fancy eclair because you ate enough of your Christmas dinner and it is, after all, bloody <em>Christmas</em>, and then having the other parent in your life unleash a torrent of his abuse on you both until your little body can&#8217;t take the stress and you just lose it, everywhere.</p>\n<p>That wasn&#8217;t the only time my biological sire made me vomit with his anger, either (or his reckless driving). To this day, strong negative emotions and, especially, <strong>angry men make me sick to my stomach.</strong></p>\n<p>I suppose it&#8217;s strange I never developed bulimia, not really. There was a period of time when I was vomiting after every meal, like clockwork, and sometimes it was induced, but it wasn&#8217;t bulimia. It was me feeling physically sick all the time, and needing some relief. As suddenly as it appeared in my life, it disappeared.</p>\n<p>No, instead, I developed binge eating disorder and, much later, anorexia.</p>\n<p>My father didn&#8217;t stop when I was two, you see. He continued to abuse me in many ways throughout my childhood and adolescence, including at the dinner table, in restaurants &#8212; really, anywhere food was involved, he made sure to give me a complex about eating.</p>\n<p>His excuse? I was being spoiled rotten by my mom and Oma, he said. Or I was getting too fat, or eating too much sugar. Or any other reason he could come up with to abuse me for daring to want food.</p>\n<p>Abusers always find it easy to justify their actions. It&#8217;s <em>for your own good</em>. Always for your own good. <strong>It was for my own good</strong> when he took me to get a treat at Dairy Queen, said I could order whatever I wanted, and then took that food away from me when I had it and ate it in front of me, saying I couldn&#8217;t have it because I was &#8216;getting fat.&#8217; <strong>It was for my own good</strong> when he screamed at me at the dinner table because I was &#8216;too fat&#8217;, making me cry and feel too sick to my stomach to eat &#8212; which he then yelled at me some more about, because I was a <em>wimp</em> who was crying and <em>why wasn&#8217;t I eating</em>? He&#8217;d slaved over the stove to make that food so I better eat it or <em>he&#8217;d give me something to cry about.</em></p>\n<p><strong>It was for my own good</strong> when he made me sit at the dinner table until I finished my food, even though I told him I didn&#8217;t like squash, not at all, not a little bit, I had to eat it because it was good for me. And when my step-siblings came in from their after-dinner swim at the pool and saw me sitting there &#8212; I was determined to sit there all night, and hoped I peed on the chair, hoped for that small revenge &#8212; they told me to take the food and just throw it in the compost, and lie about eating it! I said <em>no</em> &#8212; he&#8217;d know, he always knew, nothing was safe &#8212; but they took it and did it for my anyway, and then dad came back into the room and pulled out squash covered in coffee grinds and other organic waste and force fed it to me, holding my mouth shut until I swallowed it.</p>\n<p><strong>It was for my own good</strong> when he force-fed me salmon and called me a wimp and weakling for not liking it. To this day, the smell of salmon makes me want to vomit and cry.</p>\n<p>He was convinced that every time he put another landmine in my brain with his actions, he was doing it for my own good. He swore up and down that someday, I&#8217;d thank him.</p>\n<p>Well, he was wrong about most things, so add that to the list.</p>\n<p>The <em>for your own good</em> narrative doesn&#8217;t stop with my father, though. It continues on every day I am forced to interact with people who have bought into the propaganda of our fat hating culture. Shaming me for my food choices is <em>for my own good</em>. Constantly talking about diets is <em>for my own good.</em> Maybe, if they make me feel enough shame, I will magically lose weight. That&#8217;s the belief, so it&#8217;s easy to justify with <strong>for your own good.</strong></p>\n<p>This is all true, and it&#8217;s probably important background for this tale.<strong> But is that where I start? Is this the best place to begin for this particular story?</strong></p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s start again, maybe.</p>\n<p>Google+ has a function that shows you things from people you haven&#8217;t circled. Other people you <strong>have</strong> circled click the plus button on shares, and those things might show up in your feed. You can&#8217;t turn this off, to my knowledge, though I have posted asking people for help finding out if you can.</p>\n<p>Today someone I quite like, someone I don&#8217;t want to uncircle, plussed something that triggered my disorders to hell and gone. It was pro-diet culture &#8212; an image talking about negative or zero calorie foods. (I am not resharing it here.)</p>\n<p>On my road to anorexia one of the first things I did was learn which foods I should stick to &#8212; zero- or negative-calorie foods. I learned to love celery without peanut butter. Ate it as much as possible. Occasionally, when I could no longer fight against the hunger that gnawed at me, when I was going mad from the lack of food, I&#8217;d have a bowl of ramen &#8212; but I&#8217;d feel so guilty after that it&#8217;d be nothing but celery sticks for another few weeks, until the hunger drove me mad again.</p>\n<p>So I know very well about negative- and zero-calorie foods. And I try very hard not to think about them.</p>\n<p>The person who shared the image said it would be &#8220;useful&#8221; to people wanting to diet.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s what I thought when I started too. That I was just &#8220;helping along&#8221; my diet by focusing on zero or negative calorie foods. That I was just trying to lose a little weight.</p>\n<p>It didn&#8217;t take long for those thoughts to spiral into full-blown anorexia.</p>\n<p>I am now a recovering anorexic, and a recovering binge eater. I spend every day being vigilant about my mental processes, trying desperately to keep the voices of my disorders at bay. I&#8217;ve built walls against them, but they are smart, and the walls are not 100% strong. There are holes.</p>\n<p>And outside myself, there are battering rams, explosives, corrosive chemicals &#8212; things like that image shared, or when people start talking at length about their diets, or an explicitly anti-calorie discussion about the &#8220;nutritional qualities&#8221; of a dish. (To quote my friend Kiya Nicoll on this, &#8220;Food is good. You know how you can tell? IT SUSTAINS LIFE. Anti-calories is anti-life, dammit.&#8221;)</p>\n<p>Diet culture is actively harmful &#8212; not just to me, not just to people who are recovering from their eating disorders, but also to people who haven&#8217;t yet developed eating disorders or disordered eating. I say &#8216;yet&#8217; because with diet culture helping us along, it&#8217;s really only a matter of time for most folks.</p>\n<p>Diet culture tells us there are good foods and bad foods, and that eating the bad foods makes us bad people. It tells us that so long as we stick to good foods, we&#8217;re allowed to occasionally &#8220;indulge&#8221; in the bad foods &#8212; but only a little bit, and never as much as we actually want, or we&#8217;re Bad. Diet culture tells us that the only way we&#8217;re worth anything is if we&#8217;re a certain size (thin) and that the only way to become that size is by dieting, no matter the fact that that&#8217;s a blatant lie. Diet culture co-opts the term &#8216;diet&#8217; to mean not &#8216;the nutrients one intakes in order to keep living&#8217; but to refer to &#8216;a restricted amount of food and calories consumed in the ever-present yet false hope that doing so will change your body enough for people to think you&#8217;re a human being and treat you accordingly&#8217;.</p>\n<p>Diet culture tells young people, especially girls, that they are not good enough the way they are. It tells them food &#8212; life-sustaining food, the thing we all need to live &#8212; it tells them food is the enemy and they must always be ready to fight it.</p>\n<p>Diet culture denies the truth of individual bodies needing individual nutrition. It claims to focus on health while asserting that health can be measured by one&#8217;s size. It promotes only a few diets as ways to that <del>health</del> One True Size, and while the specifics of those diets may change over a period of months or years, someone is always going to be promoting &#8220;fewer calories in, more calories out&#8221; as the Go To for weight loss (and therefore, health). Diet culture ignores the facts that show that long-term weight loss interventions don&#8217;t work. Diet culture conflates size with health, and health with worth, and it tells people they&#8217;re allowed to shame people for not eating &#8220;correctly&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Diet culture says there is only one way to &#8220;eat correctly&#8221; and fuck you if you think your body feels better after something different, something not on the list of acceptable foods. Diet culture says you don&#8217;t know anything about your body, and if you say you do, you&#8217;re lying.</p>\n<p>Diet culture, ever sneaky, ever pernicious, hides and disguises itself in new terms like &#8220;clean eating&#8221; or &#8220;healthy lifestyle&#8221; or &#8220;real food&#8221; vs &#8220;fake food&#8221;. A whole new language has been created so people can shame you for what you eat or don&#8217;t eat without ever mentioning the term &#8220;diet&#8221; &#8212; making them blameless, of course.</p>\n<p>Diet culture leads to people talking constantly about their diets or &#8220;lifestyle changes&#8221; because they&#8217;ve internalized the belief that they are unworthy of human contact unless they try to prove, all the time, that they are trying to be different, that they are trying to earn their worth. <strong>Yes, your diet is boring &#8212; I would rather hear about your actual accomplishments, not your succumbing to a culture that hates you. It is boring to hear you talk about something that is not worth celebrating as if it is, and more than that, it is sad, and it is triggering.</strong></p>\n<p>People need to stop talking about other peoples&#8217; food choices, but more than that, they need to stop talking about their own diets. Because there&#8217;s no response to that for those of us who are triggered. If someone makes a comment to me, directly, about what I am eating, I can respond. I can tell them that&#8217;s inappropriate. If someone talks about their own diet? If I say anything, <em>I&#8217;m</em> the ass &#8212; when I&#8217;m the one getting triggered so bad I&#8217;m considering self-harm and suicide again.</p>\n<p>If you absolutely need to talk to people about your diet, do it privately, with folks who <em>want</em> that sort of conversation. If you&#8217;re on G+ create a circle for it. On FB? Join a group, or create a private list. Don&#8217;t share that shit publicly. Because your right to swing your fists in the air ends where my face begins, and that pro-diet, pro-disordered eating stuff is like 10 punches in the face for me, <strong>every time</strong>.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m tired of feeling bruised and battered from a session of social media. I&#8217;m tired of being afraid of signing into my networks, never sure who&#8217;s going to do this to me next.</p>\n<p>If you are a person who shares this pro-diet culture, pro-eating disorder stuff, I want you to stop and think: are there any people in your circles or friends lists who might be recovering from eating disorders? If the answer is <em>maybe</em>, ask yourself this: do I care enough about these people that I don&#8217;t want to hurt them? If I met these people on the street, would I punch them in the face and feel no remorse? If you do care enough that you don&#8217;t want to inflict pain, if you would feel remorse, then don&#8217;t share those pro-diet things.</p>\n<p>Everyone will be a lot happier if you choose not to spread that stuff around in public.</p>\n<p>-Katje</p>\n<p>PS: comments will be closely moderated; if I get too high an influx of crap I will turn them off. This is not the place to share your concern-trolling about people&#8217;s sizes or any other pro-diet, fat-hating BS. Nor is the place to tell me I&#8217;m wrong and that dieting &#8220;successfully&#8221; is something to be celebrated. A: <a href=\"http://danceswithfat.wordpress.com/2014/06/21/how-can-you-say-weight-loss-doesnt-work/\">There is no such thing as a successful diet</a>.

I mean, for fuck&#8217;s sake, Jenny and Vastra didn&#8217;t even get a good shot! They got an <em>awful</em> close up. It was an incredibly small bone to throw our way.</p>\n<p>Not only that, but some of those kisses that are apparently just <em>dandy</em> for a kids&#8217; show are very hazy on issues of consent. The first Rose and Ten kiss, f&#8217;ex, is actually Cassandra in Rose&#8217;s body. Ten doesn&#8217;t ask Martha if he can kiss her, he just does, and then treats her like shit during the rest of the season. <strong>Oh, and let&#8217;s not forget where Eleven forcibly kisses Jenny &#8212; a queer woman &#8212; against her will.</strong> She slaps him after, and he doesn&#8217;t even apologize, or admit that he was wrong. Hell, the scene was quite clearly <a href=\"http://cratesandribbons.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/kissing-sailor.jpg?w=600&amp;h=897\">a staging of this picture</a> &#8212; which has <a href=\"http://cratesandribbons.com/2012/09/30/the-kissing-sailor-or-the-selective-blindness-of-rape-culture-vj-day-times-square/\">recently had the romance debunked right out of it to show it&#8217;s a picture of someone&#8217;s consent being violated</a>. No, see, those are all <em>just fine</em> for kids to watch. But have two married women lock lips briefly to save each other&#8217;s lives and suddenly it&#8217;s &#8220;pushing preferences&#8221; and &#8220;brainwashing the kiddies&#8221; and the show has a &#8220;blatant gay agenda&#8221;. (Yes, blatant gay agenda, because look at ALL those examples of gay relationships! SO MANY OF THEM THE GAY IS LITERALLY FALLING OUT OF THE SHOW AND CRUSHING US)</p>\n<p>If you want something in <em>Doctor Who</em> to get upset about, take your pick: casual sexism, hazy issues of consent throughout that are often played for laughs, fatphobia&#8230;. These are all problems in our mainstream culture that get replicated in our fiction and media.</p>\n<p>You know what another problem is? Invisibility of queer people. At least <em>Doctor Who</em> (and its spinoff, <em>Torchwood</em>) have taken steps to remedying <em>that.</em></p>\n<p>And yet that&#8217;s what people flip out about. Because ~*~think of the children~*~.</p>\n<p><strong>I am thinking of the children:</strong> the queer children who have little to zero representation on television. <strong>For them, Jenny and Vastra&#8217;s kiss is a victory.</strong> An incredibly small one in the face of the figurative flood of heterosexual representation, but a victory nonetheless.</p>\n<p>If you have a problem with that, I suggest you reexamine if you&#8217;re really concerned for children (ALL children, not just heterosexual ones), or if you&#8217;re just using &#8220;think of the children!&#8221; as a convenient excuse for your bigotry. If it&#8217;s the latter, I recommend a bigotryectomy.*</p>\n<p>-Katje</p>\n<p>*I considered the word <em>bigotectomy,</em> as it sounds better, but <em>bigotryectomy</em> is more accurate: I&#8217;m suggesting a removal of bigotry from people, changing them from bigots into decent human beings; not the removal of bigots from people, which sounds like a fancy new word for fungus or tumours or something.</p>\n<p><strong>Featured image credit:</strong> &#8220;Dr Who (316350537)&#8221; by aussiegall from sydney, Australia &#8211; Dr WhoUploaded by russavia.

It was from this chick who calls herself the &#8220;Food Babe&#8221; and it was full of paranoia, propaganda, lies, and bullshit &#8212; with a huge, HEAPING dose of food shaming. (I am not sharing the image on this post, because it&#8217;s food-shaming and gross and could trigger either eating disorders or an explosion of rage, and I really don&#8217;t want to give any of y&#8217;all aneurysms.)</p>\n<p>You can easily see this image is a crock of crap <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/food/ingredient/pumpkinspicelatte.asp\">if you go to Snopes</a> (warning, they do share it).

She actually appears to be on a bit of a crusade against them, which sends up MAJOR red flags as to whether or not I should trust what she says. She claims to be skeptical, but doesn&#8217;t realize that to be skeptical means to <em>neither believe nor disbelieve</em> &#8212; ie, be <strong>neutral</strong> &#8212; not hold in outright contempt. (<em>Lots</em> of self-identified skeptics could stand to relearn the definition of the word.)</p>\n<p>One of her complaints? &#8220;The latte has no real pumpkin in it!&#8221;</p>\n<p>Well, duh? It&#8217;s a Pumpkin <em>Spice</em> Latte, not a Pumpkin Guts or Pumpkin Seeds Latte. Honestly, having pumpkin mash in your latte would be disgusting and not drinkable. I ordered a Pumpkin Spice Latte, not a flipping smoothie. I&#8217;m perfectly okay with that delicious spicy flavour coming from a syrup, not actual pumpkins. (Also, can you imagine the <em>cost?</em> Starbucks is already expensive.)</p>\n<div style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a title=\"fall coffee by Kat van Loon, on Flickr\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/katjevanloon/8073529149\"><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8322/8073529149_b525b5feaf.jpg\" alt=\"fall coffee\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Mmm, delicious pumpkin-free coffee on a nice fall day.</p></div>\n<p>The biggest issue with the Pumpkin Spice Latte, according to &#8220;Food Babe&#8221;, is the inclusion of Caramel Colour IV because it&#8217;s apparently carcinogenic. What she fails to note is that the thing that is carcinogenic, 4-MEI, not only occurs as a natural byproduct of cooking some foods, but is in levels so small the FDA has labelled it as safe. Here&#8217;s a quote from them:</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>What is 4-methylimidazole (4-MEI)?</strong></p>\n<p>4-methylimidazole (4-MEI) is a chemical compound that is not directly added to food; rather it is formed as a byproduct in some foods and beverages during the normal cooking process. For example, 4-MEI may form when coffee beans are roasted and when meats are roasted or grilled. 4-MEI also forms as a trace impurity during the manufacturing of certain types of caramel coloring (known as Class III and Class IV caramel coloring) that are used to color cola-type beverages and other foods.</p>\n<p><strong>Is there a risk from eating foods that contain 4-MEI?</strong></p>\n<p>Based on the available information, FDA has no reason to believe that there is any immediate or short-term danger presented by 4-MEI at the levels expected in food from the use of caramel coloring.</p></blockquote>\n<p>See that? <strong>It may form when coffee beans are being roasted.</strong> So you can&#8217;t even escape it by eschewing Pumpkin Spice Lattes and drinking home-made coffee. Don&#8217;t think your barbecue is safe, either, because it might form in grilled meats.</p>\n<p>Bottom line on this one: the FDA may not be infallible, but they&#8217;re also not run by a cabal intent on hiding info to poison the world. Trust them on this one, and not &#8220;Food Babe&#8221; (whose qualifications are <em>what,</em> exactly?).</p>\n<p>She also claims Starbucks is hiding the ingredient list, which is an outright lie, seeing as it&#8217;s listed on their website. Though it should be noted, the ingredients for the pumpkin syrup listed on the site is the ingredients for the sold-for-home syrup, which differs from the syrup used in retail locations. Namely, the syrup used in retail locations doesn&#8217;t have HFCS, while the sold-for-home syrup does.</p>\n<p>Another claim: made with &#8220;Monsanto milk!&#8221; Yeah, no. <a href=\"http://consumerist.com/2007/09/05/starbucks-to-stop-using-monsanto-milk/\">Starbucks phased out the use of Monsanto milk products back in 2007</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Food Babe&#8221; also seems to think that 50g of sugar is a &#8220;toxic dose&#8221;. <strong>If nothing else, this should tell you she&#8217;s completely ignorant and shouldn&#8217;t be trusted.</strong> 50g is not a toxic dose of sugar. A fruit salad would send you to ER if it were. &#8220;She&#8217;s probably talking about processed sugars,&#8221; you may shout, desperately clinging to the idea that this woman knows something (hint: she doesn&#8217;t). Even if she is, 50g of processed sugar is not a toxic dose. Most North Americans get that level daily, or at least weekly. <strong>Most of us would be dead or dying if 50g were a <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">toxic</span> dose.</strong></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5012\" src=\"https://amoebakat.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/inconceivable.png?w=502&#038;h=282\" alt=\"inconceivable\" width=\"502\" height=\"282\" /></p>\n<p>Also on the list: &#8220;ambiguous &#8216;natural flavours&#8217; that can be made from <em><strong>anything on earth</strong></em>&#8220;. OH MY GODS. NATURAL FLAVOURS FROM <em>ANYTHING?</em> IT&#8217;S PROBABLY MADE OUT OF BELLADONNA AND HEMLOCK, FOR THAT ZESTY AFTERBURN. Fear-monger more, lady.</p>\n<p>Artificial flavours she claims are made from petroleum. Uh, sources please? Oh wait, you probably can&#8217;t supply any, which explains why there are none in the blog post and it&#8217;s all just a bunch of vague fear-mongering. (Which leaves me wondering about the critical thinking skills of the people who take what you say at face value.)</p>\n<p>Preservatives and sulfites that &#8220;can cause allergic reactions.&#8221; Look, anything can cause allergic reactions. Literally <em>anything.</em> And on that note, Mr. Katje&#8217;s mom is allergic to sulfites and she&#8217;s able to drink Pumpkin Spice Lattes WITH NO ILL EFFECTS. (So long as she orders it without nutmeg.) So I seriously doubt the levels of sulfites are at a dangerous level.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Possible pesticide residue from using non-organic coffee beans.&#8221; Oh my gods could you be any more pretentious. If you want organic coffee beans, go to a different store, and complain about how much more expensive it is while you talk about how environmentally conscious you are drinking a beverage <strong>made from beans that are shipped thousands of miles to make it into your cup regardless if they&#8217;re organic or not.</strong> Also, sources please? And maybe you could mention what kind of pesticides are used, seeing as there are MANY MANY pesticides that are completely harmless to humans. Oh wait, again, you can&#8217;t supply any of this info, because you don&#8217;t actually know anything.</p>\n<p>Her final complaint? The latte is <em>not vegan</em> even with soy milk options because of the use of condensed milk products. Again: sources, please. Also: you are ordering a coffee from a place that gets hundreds of customers a day. There may be trace elements of something not vegan in your soy-substituted latte. I&#8217;m sorry, but that&#8217;s the truth. It might happen. You may not get 100% precision with your drink made by a rushed barista who just dealt with three assholes and someone under the influence (I salute you, baristas). If you absolutely cannot abide by minuscule trace elements of non-vegan ingredients in your food, then I advise you to eschew lattes at Starbucks, stick to their regular coffee, and bring your own soy or other milk substitute to add. Or just make coffee at home. Or learn to like it black.</p>\n<p>This entire sundae of BS is topped off with the words &#8220;THINK before you drink!&#8221; Not only does &#8220;Food Babe&#8221;, with her absolute lack of any qualifications in the area of nutrition or chemistry, want to spread a bunch of lies about various foods that people enjoy, she has to shame them for liking them. Food Babe, I <strong>did</strong> think before I had that Pumpkin Spice Latte. I thought, <em>Man, today would be great for a delicious Pumpkin Spice Latte, </em>and then I enjoyed a delicious Pumpkin Spice Latte and suffered no ill effects from it. Just because I didn&#8217;t come to the same (misinformed) conclusions you did does not mean I didn&#8217;t think.</p>\n<p>While I spent the past several days ranting about this image to Mr. Katje and anyone who would listen, it became clear to me that I&#8217;d seen &#8220;Food Babe&#8221; around before &#8212; back when she posted some serious BS about the ~*~dangers~*~ of beer. <a href=\"http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/vani-hari-a-k-a-the-food-babe-the-jenny-mccarthy-of-food/\">That was thoroughly debunked by people who actually know chemistry and science</a>. From the link:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Yes, it would appear that the Food Babe got her education from popular books and Google University and somehow got the messianic bug to save the world! Maybe a better way to describe her is the Jenny McCarthy of the food industry. Of course, I don\u2019t mean that as a compliment. Just as Jenny McCarthy has been a prime force spreading fear and ignorance about vaccines, Vani Hari has been a malignant force promoting ignorance about food. Sure, mixed in with all the pseudoscience, antivaccine beliefs, and <a href=\"http://www.science20.com/pfired_still_kicking/food_babe_hath_spoken_and_subway_bread_will_still_suck-131716\">admiration of cranks like Russell Blaylock</a>, is the occasional bit of good advice about eating more vegetables, avoiding too much processed food, and recipes that, for all I know, might actually be tasty. But the price is too high, buried as the occasional trivial bit of good advice is under the tsunami of nonsense.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Bottom line, Food Babe &#8212; or &#8220;Fraud Broad&#8221; as she&#8217;s becoming known &#8212; is a quack. She has no qualifications for what she&#8217;s talking about, and it shows. Her conclusions are BS and she thinks that &#8220;chemicals are dangerous&#8221;.</strong></p>\n<p>Right. Chemicals are dangerous. I guess we should work to avoid things like Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B12), or (2R,3S,4S,5R,6R)-2-(hydroxymethyl)-6-[(2R,3S,4R,5R,6S)-4,5,6-trihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)oxan-3-yl]oxy-oxane-3,4,5-triol (Starch), or (heavens forfend) 3,7-Dihydro-1,3,7-trimethyl-1H-purine-2,6-dione (Caffeine).*** All very dangerous things that will surely kill us! <strong>Live a chemical-free life today: stop eating, drinking, and breathing.</strong></p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not listening to anything the Fraud Broad has to say, and neither should you. Her stuff is not only fraudulent to the point of being dangerous, it&#8217;s food-shaming, too. If you want to read things from an <em>actual nutritionist</em> who won&#8217;t shame you, <a href=\"http://www.fatnutritionist.com/\">I recommend Michelle Allison</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>And keep on drinking your Pumpkin Spice Lattes! I&#8217;m certainly not stopping.

Actually, the bone is healed, I just can&#8217;t walk normally yet (muscles, ligaments, etc, are not so eager). But I can walk with the help of my crutches and I should be able to walk normally by the end of this month. I just have to take it slow, and be patient and ARRRRGGGG I DON&#8217;T WANT TO BE PATIENT WHEN ARE WE GETTING CYBERNETIC BODY PARTS FFS? Ahem. I mean, yes. Patience. Taking it slow. Things I am <strong><em>so good at don&#8217;t you know</em></strong>.</li>\n<li>You might notice a change to the info in the sidebar. Specifically, images for Barefoot Books. <strong>I am now a Barefoot Books ambassador</strong> and will be selling children&#8217;s books to anyone who&#8217;s interested. I am pretty excited about this opportunity, as I love books (duh), am interested in championing literacy (double-duh), and the books are really high quality (you&#8217;ll have to take my word for this for now). I am probably going to pen a larger post in the next few days, but for now I just wanted to give y&#8217;all a small heads up. (Also, don&#8217;t worry, I won&#8217;t turn into a spam-o-matic.)</li>\n<li>I submitted 2 pieces of microfiction to a writing contest and I am incredibly nervous. Winners are announced at the end of October. <em>That is a long time away.</em> Someone hold me.</li>\n<li><strong>There is still time to pre-order <em>Broken Sleep</em>,</strong> my mom&#8217;s new book! I know, I know, shameless plugging, but I&#8217;m serious when I say it&#8217;s a good book, and <strong>you get a discount for pre-order.</strong> So if you want to read the really incredible first book in The Falling Sky Trilogy, <a href=\"http://katandwolff.com/books/the-falling-sky-trilogy/broken-sleep/\">go here and click the link of your choice</a>. (Paperbacks ordered from Storenvy will be signed!)</li>\n<li>I will be doing <strong>Fifty Shades of Drinking</strong> again starting in a few weeks. My goal is to have the next episode up by October 1st. Hopefully I will be able to stick to that. It depends on how well I can walk by then. (The problem being, of course, that going to the bathroom is such a tremendous effort while one is on crutches that drinking alcohol is a <em>terrible</em> idea. Water I can hold for 4, 6, 8, 12 hours. Coffee about 4 to 6. Alcohol? 1 hour. And then every 15 minutes for a few hours after. That is way too much hobbling for me right now, unfortunately.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That&#8217;s the news in a nutshell, basically. New site look and layout, my leg is doing well, Barefoot Books is a thing that&#8217;s happening for me, I am now submitting short fiction and terrified, <em>Broken Sleep</em> is coming out really soon, and Fifty Shades of Drinking&#8217;s hiatus is nearing its end time.</p>\n<p>-Katje</p>\n", "post_id": 5008, "location": false, "date": "09-09-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["True Blood", "stories: The Jade Star of Athering", "housekeeping", "comments", "stories: Bellica"], "text": "<p>I announced on my Facebook page last night that I had big news to reveal today.</p>\n<p>The big news is I finished revising <i>The Jade Star of Athering</i> and sent it off to the editor a few nights ago.

General content warning for the post.</p>\n<p>So, first: I want to say that objectively, my life is pretty great. And subjectively, too. I&#8217;m engaged to a really awesome person who respects me and my career. We live together in a nice place, in a nice neighborhood. I&#8217;ve started a new business and my career as an author is going pretty well. Overall our life is a nice thing.</p>\n<p>But of course this does not preclude shitty things happening to us, and of course our lives are not 100% great. There are definitely areas that are causing some long-term stress and, for me at least, depression, anxiety, and all those other fun things I get to deal with already for no particular reason. Except now they&#8217;re being given a reason, and I&#8217;m finding my already fragile mental state being poked at constantly.</p>\n<p>The main thing that&#8217;s poking the bear of mental illness for me right now is my physical state. Some of you know that almost 3 years ago I suffered a spinal injury. That&#8217;s actually not entirely accurate; the injury itself happened in 2009. It didn&#8217;t flare up like a fireworks show, however, until 2012, leaving me bedridden and unable to walk for weeks. After a lot of hard work in physiotherapy, I slowly was able to walk with a walker for short bursts, and then longer bursts, and then finally upgraded to a cane. I&#8217;ve been walking with a cane since 2012, though there have been times when I&#8217;ve been able to go without for a short period of time.</p>\n<p>Likely, had I continued with the physio after getting to that state of wellness, I would eventually have gotten to a point where I could walk without a cane, and probably get somewhere near the state of health I was at before the injury knocked me down. Even in the years I had the injury but it hadn&#8217;t flared up I was doing pretty well, despite the new, sharp, knife-twisting pain in my lower spine that I had chalked up to &#8220;Another weird permutation of the chronic back pain I&#8217;ve had my entire life because genetics is a shitty lottery.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But I didn&#8217;t continue with the physio. I quit in 2012. This wasn&#8217;t because I wanted to, or because I thought I was done: I wanted to continue and knew I needed more. But I could not find a new physiotherapist when I went back to Nanaimo after staying in Coquitlam for several weeks, and not only that &#8212; the price went up. You only get a few visits at the reduced rate with a doctor&#8217;s prescription, you see, and I would need to continue to go every week to see progress.</p>\n<p>Fifty dollars a week is too steep for me. Then, and now.</p>\n<p>So for 2 years I have lived no where near what &#8220;normal&#8221; is for me, just dealing with the pain, taking a strong painkiller on the days when I can&#8217;t move without it, and continuing to do things that are probably contraindicated for my spine&#8217;s condition but hey, what else am I going to do? My social life has dropped off considerably and my ability to do a lot of things in a short period of time has gone to zilch, approximately. I now need a few days to recover after an event that wouldn&#8217;t have left me winded 3 years ago.</p>\n<p>It has been an adjustment, to say the least. I still overextend myself because I am used to a body that can handle more than it can. And though mentally I have gotten better since it first happened, I still have dark nights of the soul.</p>\n<p>So when I broke my leg this summer &#8212; 3 months exactly as of this coming Saturday &#8212; I slipped into depression again.</p>\n<p>Here I was, looking at 3 months at least of not being able to do what I was doing before, which by itself was not *good enough* for me. I was a pretty active person, once upon a time. I was strong. Heck, in high school I was known as &#8220;one of the strongest girls in the drama department.&#8221; Even with my genetically-diminished back.</p>\n<p>But now, I was in a recliner with a broken femur and a broken spine and a broken spirit.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_4957\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-4957\" src=\"https://amoebakat.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/leginbrace.jpg?w=640&#038;h=640\" alt=\"My leg in an immobilizer.\" width=\"640\" height=\"640\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">This was my only reality. It was hard to take.</p></div>\n<p>Trauma to the body is difficult to deal with when you&#8217;re not already saddled with mental illnesses like depression or PTSD. Those ghosts taking up residence in my brain made it that much harder to accept.</p>\n<p>After several weeks of depression, wild mood swings, and lots of crying, I finally got to a more emotionally balanced place &#8212; even if I was still depressed, at least I wasn&#8217;t having a complete breakdown every five minutes. And then, finally, the day came &#8212; I got the news that I&#8217;m allowed to walk without the crutches, after 3 weeks of walking without putting full weight on the (now-healed) leg.</p>\n<p>Of course what I discovered during those three weeks of sort-of walking with the aid of the crutches was that my spine had gotten worse. Weeks of compensating for an out-of-commission leg meant that now I was in even more pain than before.</p>\n<p>Walking without the crutches is possible for me now, at least around the house and for short distances. But it&#8217;s agonizing. Getting up for more than a few minutes at a time hurts my back so much I want to die.</p>\n<p>And I am back to being depressed and full of self-loathing (even though I have a prescription for physio from the doctor; I&#8217;m not able to go until I can drive again, which will happen&#8230;???? I don&#8217;t know when; and even then, I don&#8217;t know how many visits I&#8217;ll be able to squeeze in before I can&#8217;t afford it again). I am a huge proponent of radical self-love, and I stand by that: but right now? I hate my body. I hate that it&#8217;s broken. I hate that it&#8217;s slowed me down so much. I hate that it doesn&#8217;t listen to me, that the pain is constant, that I can only accomplish a few things each day. I hate that today it was too much for me to shower.</p>\n<p>And I hate myself, for being a klutz in the first place and breaking my leg. I hate myself for getting too drunk that night in 2009 to think to move out of the way before 2 people landed on my head and compressed my spine. I hate myself for being so broke that I can&#8217;t afford the physio that will give me something resembling a normal life again, that will allow me to no longer be a burden on my loved ones.</p>\n<p>I am a broken spirit in a broken vessel, and this has been getting me down for quite some time.</p>\n<p>Until tonight. Tonight &#8212; I don&#8217;t know why this happened, or why the catalyst for it was what it was &#8212; and the catalyst doesn&#8217;t matter, not really. What matters is that tonight, for some reason, I was reminded of <a href=\"http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/leonardcohen/anthem.html\">Leonard Cohen</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Forget your perfect offering<br />\nRing the bells that still can ring<br />\nThere&#8217;s a crack in everything<br />\nThat&#8217;s how the light gets in.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>I am broken. But I&#8217;m perfect, too, because there <em>are</em> still bells that can ring. I am a cracked chalice. Light flows from me and into me. I was made perfectly, and after I broke, I was repaired perfectly. I am still perfect, though I may be broken.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know how long this feeling will last. But I wanted to write about it, before it went away, so I could remind myself and anyone else who may be reading this, who may need to know this right now: <i>you may be broken but you are still perfect. Your body may be injured but it is still holy. There is room for these strong emotions, whatever they may be, within all this. You can still be perfect, and broken, whether you love or hate yourself right now. </i></p>\n<p>-Katje</p>\n", "post_id": 5156, "location": false, "date": "09-30-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Wordpress"], "text": "<p>I know, I&#8217;ve done this before &#8212; from WordPress.com to my self-hosted site, then back to WordPress.com.

But this is no ordinary letter &#8212; it&#8217;s a letter to someone who may go down in history as the single most important influence in my life.</p>\n<p>Ms. Loudon was my drama teacher in high school. I went to HP Baldwin High in the hopes of joining the drama club, and join I did. I soon learned that I knew nothing about work ethic, as I was always the first one sneaking out of the room to avoid doing anything strenuous. After Ms. Loudon was done with me, I was the first to jump in and work, yelling at the Freshman for being lazy.</p>\n<p>I was really depressed in high school, and I think &#8212; had I not had a purpose in drama &#8212; I could have really hurt myself. But that room was my home, and Ms. Loudon was the Queen of it. She was my Queen. (I remember at some point I ran into the room, fell to my knees in front of her, and said &#8220;Ms Loudon! I am your <em>spaniel</em>!&#8221; because you can never go wrong with a quote from <em>Midsummer&#8217;s</em>. At another point in time, she was addressing everyone in the auditorium and I had something to tell her. I walked up to her and dropped to one knee, arm crossed over my chest, and said &#8220;My liege.&#8221; I could always make her laugh.)</p>\n<p>Ms. Loudon not only taught me a strong work ethic, but she also taught me how to act, how to make an inch of paint in the bucket paint the whole front of the stage, how to use duct tape to fix anything, how to hide the mess in the room in order to get ready for a show, how to quick change in the dark, how to do make-up quickly before the sun set, how to not break character when the sets are crashing down around your ears, and &#8212; most importantly &#8212; how to treat your fellow actors.</p>\n<p>There were no divas in our drama room because Ms. Loudon wouldn&#8217;t stand for it. Everyone was equal, and bad behaviour was tolerated no more or less from a lead role than it would have been from a chorus member.</p>\n<p>That strict etiquette is, I&#8217;m sad to say, lacking in the other places I&#8217;ve been.</p>\n<p>I excelled at theatre not only because I had raw natural talent for it (I do, let&#8217;s not be coy), but because I was <em>willing</em> to learn what Ms. Loudon had to offer me. I would not be where I am today were it not for her influence and presence in my life.</p>\n<p>This blog post doesn&#8217;t even come close to expressing all my feelings about Ms. Loudon. So you see my trouble when it comes to trying to write this to her in a <em>letter</em>.</p>\n<p>She is turning 70 at the end of July and the letter is supposed to be part of a huge birthday bash for her. It&#8217;s a surprise, so you won&#8217;t see this blog post until after the fact &#8212; just in case.</p>\n<p>So, where do I even begin?</p>\n<p>Dear Ms. Loudon&#8230;.</p>\n", "post_id": 680, "location": false, "date": "08-01-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Hermione Granger", "J. K. Rowling", "Harry Potter", "Harry Potter universe", "The End of an Era", "Hogwarts"], "text": "<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Unless you live under a rock, you&#8217;re aware that the final <em>Harry Potter</em> film was recently released. If you know any fans of the series (statistically speaking, you probably do), you have somewhat of an inkling just how big a fucking deal this is.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">For me, <em>Harry Potter</em> ending represents the ending of my childhood. Sure, I didn&#8217;t like the movies when they first came out (for many reasons that deserve their own blog post, really), but after the books ended the movies became the last thing to look forward to. Now, the final film has released, and its leaving theatres at the end of summer signals the imminent end to my adolescence.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Ok, ok, I&#8217;m almost 25 and so technically my adolescence ended about 6 years ago. Biologically, at least. Socially and mentally, I&#8217;m still a teenager. (Socially because no one really treats you like an adult until after the magical age of 25, and mentally because a) when one is treated like a teenager one tends to remain in that mindset and b) I don&#8217;t really want to grow up.) When I started reading <em>Harry Potter</em>, I was a really fucked up teenager. I was floundering, lost in depression and bad choices. One morning Mom woke me up by flinging a book at my head; I opened it up and started reading, and from that moment on my life began to change.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The Golden Trio were characters who were major influences during my formative years (as were the rest of the characters in the series). The <em>Harry Potter</em> series taught me about the power of friendship and its value. It taught me about courage in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds. It taught me that it&#8217;s ok to be emotional and logical at the same time (Hermione: truly feminist witch). It taught me about strength of heart, and the power of love.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">On top of all the lessons the series had to offer me, it also offered me escape \u2013 but an escape that I could share with other people, which was far more valuable than an escape only I knew about.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">My friends and I were rabid <em>Harry Potter</em> fans. At one point three of us called ourselves the Golden Trio (because we were, really), and a group of my friends in high school and I would run around LARPing on campus as <em>Harry Potter</em> (and <em>Lord of the Rings</em>) characters. (Not true LARP, there were no costumes and we were far from SRS BSNS.) When we didn&#8217;t want to think about all the shit that was happening in our lives (and my friends and I went through a lot of shit in our adolescence), we had Hogwarts to escape to.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">I used to dream that my letter had gotten lost, and I was truly a student at Hogwarts. Sometimes I still do.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Now, I have to face a future where we&#8217;re not waiting for another instalment of the life-changing series (JKR has said that there are \u201cno more books in her\u201d which I have a lot of strong opinions about, but anyway), where everything <em>Harry Potter-</em>related is an expression of nostalgia, not anticipation.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">There&#8217;s nothing wrong with that, but it does signify the ending of an era of my life \u2013 and the lives of many other people. That ending needs to be mourned. Life goes on, but only after we&#8217;ve given what is ended its proper dues.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">So I graduate from Hogwarts \u2013 I can go back, but as alumni, visiting current students. I don&#8217;t have much in common with them \u2013 I&#8217;m now in the adult wizarding world, working (as an Auror, of course), and I cannot recapture that magic of school days.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">My one hope is that someday in the future my children will pick up a copy of <em>Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#8217;s Stone</em>, and I can watch the magic begin all over again with a new generation of young wizards and witches, who have yet to learn just how powerful they really are.</p>\n", "post_id": 692, "location": false, "date": "08-01-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Literature", "Democracy", "poetry", "Robert Frost", "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening", "Langston Hughes"], "text": "<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>Favourite Poem or Collection of Poetry</strong></p>\n<p>This is a difficult one.

Dumbledore&#8217;s words of wisdom reached more ears than just Harry&#8217;s, I can tell you that.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">In fact, you could say my obsession got bigger as time went on &#8212; the more adult I became, the more engrossed in the world of Hogwarts I became, clinging to a world I didn&#8217;t want to graduate.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Well, graduation&#8217;s over, and I&#8217;m ready to face the world head-on. I should hope so, for I&#8217;m 25 now and if I&#8217;m not ready at <em>this</em> age, I never <em>will</em> be. The lessons I learned at Hogwarts will help me with that &#8212; I have an arsenal of spells at my disposal, courage and luck guiding my hand, and friendship to keep me strong.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">And <strong>eternal fucking gratitude</strong> that it was <em>not</em> a bugfuck obsession with <em>Twilight</em> that shaped my adolescence, because otherwise I&#8217;d be wailing about how I need a boyfriend to continue to live (I can tell you that if I were a twihard, my boyfriend would not be with me &#8212; thank the gods for that; it shows he has strength of character) and probably still living in my mother&#8217;s house, provided she hadn&#8217;t killed and eaten her own young by this point.</p>\n", "post_id": 927, "location": false, "date": "08-15-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Harry Potter", "Severus Snape"], "text": "<div class=\"zemanta-img\">\n<div style=\"width: 228px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Young_Severus_Snape.jpg\"><img title=\"Teenage Severus Snape (Alec Hopkins) in Harry ...\" alt=\"Teenage Severus Snape (Alec Hopkins) in Harry ...\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/21/Young_Severus_Snape.jpg\" width=\"218\" height=\"193\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image via Wikipedia</p></div>\n</div>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>Saddest character death OR best/most satisfying character death (or both!)</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I realise I&#8217;ve been <a title=\"Graduation from Hogwarts: the end of Harry Potter and my\u00a0adolescence\" href=\"http://katjevanloon.com/graduation-from-hogwarts-the-end-of-harry-potter-and-my-adolescence/\">talking a lot about Harry Potter in the past few weeks</a>, but you&#8217;ll have to bear with me as I do so again with <a href=\"http://wp.me/ppYI4-eX\">this particular topic</a>. Warning, thar be spoilers ahead. (Major fucking spoilers for the last book/movie, so if you haven&#8217;t read or seen it by now DO NOT READ THIS POST.)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The <em>Harry Potter</em> series is full of character deaths. Perhaps not so many as other fantasy series, but a fair whack. They&#8217;re all written well enough to bring at least a tear to the reader&#8217;s eye &#8212; who didn&#8217;t choke a bit at Cedric Diggory&#8217;s death (<em>especially</em> in the film, with Amos screaming in anguish &#8220;That&#8217;s my boy!&#8221;), or sob like crazy when Sirius went beyond the veil in the Department of Mysteries? These characters were unequivocally seen as good guys, so their deaths hurt.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Not as much, however, as Snape&#8217;s death in the final book.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Many of you didn&#8217;t trust Snape after the ending of <em>Half-Blood Prince</em>, which I suppose is understandable &#8212; myself, I always trusted him, and knew the reasons behind his actions would be revealed and he would be good at heart. I was pleased to see myself vindicated, even as I cried out every drop of moisture my body possessed.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">In Snape&#8217;s final moments, he gives Harry all his memories, and in a single chapter JK Rowling tells a devastating love story: that of Snape&#8217;s hopeless passion for Lily, how every action on his part was to protect <em>her only child</em>. She shows Snape&#8217;s pain in following Dumbledore&#8217;s orders to the very last &#8212; to have to kill the only man who had granted him his trust, his only real friend. And his refusal to accept that Harry Potter&#8217;s fate is to die &#8212; that they&#8217;ve been raising the child like a pig for slaughter, that soon all that remains of Lily in the world will be snuffed out, extinguished like a candle not allowed to burn out its full life.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Had Snape not been bitten by Nagini, had he not died giving Harry his memories, we never would have known all this. He never would have been vindicated. Harry would never know the truth &#8212; that Snape had grown fond of him, had grown to view him like the son he never had.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">And so it is that Snape&#8217;s death is not only the saddest I can think of, but also the most satisfying &#8212; it&#8217;s only in death that he is redeemed, only in death do we see the true Severus.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><del datetime=\"2011-08-03T11:48:44+00:00\"><a href=\"http://wp.me/ppYI4-dA\">And only in death do we get that ridiculous fucking name for Harry&#8217;s kid.</a></del></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">This is what makes Severus&#8217; death so truly poignant and heartbreaking. It is not until all sides of the story are known that we can see true goodness, brought about by nearly impossible choices.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\n", "post_id": 942, "location": false, "date": "08-16-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["women writers in SF&amp;F", "Writers Worth Reading"], "text": "<p>As you may or may not know, I am always on the lookout for other writers of fantasy, especially of either the feminist or woman-identified variety (or both).</p>\n<p>When I was voting on <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2011/08/02/138894873/vote-for-top-100-science-fiction-fantasy-titles\">NPR Book&#8217;s Top 100 Science-Fiction, Fantasy Titles</a> (which is a flawed list but that&#8217;s beside the point), I saw &#8220;The Inheritance Trilogy&#8221; by an N.

As this is the blog of a writer and an avid reader, my topic will be <strong>Books I Think You Should Pick Up</strong> <strong>(And Read, Obviously)</strong>. This will probably remain the topic for a while, but I will always post the topic as the title for the entry.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>The City of Ember</em>, by Jeanne DuPrau. YA literature is not just for young people and <em>The City of Ember</em> is highly enjoyable. (Though, if you plan on seeing the film as well I recommend watching the movie <em>first</em>, so it doesn&#8217;t spoil your enjoyment of the book.)</li>\n<li><em>Green Grass, Running Water</em>, by Thomas King. I&#8217;ve <a title=\"30 in 30: Day 14 (in which I briefly talk about the Chaotic Canine, as portrayed by Thomas\u00a0King)\" href=\"http://katjevanloon.com/30-in-30-day-14-in-which-i-briefly-talk-about-the-chaotic-canine-as-portrayed-by-thomas-king/\">blogged about this great book before</a>, but I think it bears reiterating that it&#8217;s well worth your time to pick up this novel and give it a read. It starts out a bit wonky, as King doesn&#8217;t adhere to traditional rules in novel writing, but persevere &#8212; it&#8217;s worth it.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://thepackpress.com/poetry/glasstown/\"><em>glasstown</em></a>, by yours truly. This is my poetry book, and I think a lot of people should pick it up (by which I mean buy it) and read it. Just saying.</li>\n<li><em>The Undomestic Goddess</em>, by Sophie Kinsella. This is a good story about a high-powered lawyer who finds out who she really is in the unlikeliest of places &#8212; the kitchen of a rich family. It&#8217;s not &#8220;chick lit&#8221;* because it&#8217;s not about how important it is to have a boyfriend &#8212; it&#8217;s about how important it is to be true to yourself. (The fact that there&#8217;s a hot guy involved? Bonus!)</li>\n<li><em>The Fifth Sacred Thing</em>, by Starhawk. <a title=\"30 in 30: Day 02 (in which I\u2019m actually pretty serious about The Fifth Sacred\u00a0Thing)\" href=\"http://katjevanloon.com/30-in-30-day-02-in-which-im-actually-pretty-serious-about-the-fifth-sacred-thing/\">Another great book I&#8217;ve blogged about</a>. Seriously, pick this up and read it. The film has reached its funding goal on Kickstarter, which means that soon pre-production will begin. I&#8217;m sending an email to Starhawk to ask for the chance to audition. So, who knows &#8212; you might see me on the silver screen in a few years. <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-wink' title=';)'>;)</span> Regardless what happens, read this book.

I&#8217;ve blogged about the amazing Kushiel&#8217;s Legacy series on multiple occasions, but if you want to get into it I recommend starting with this book. It is the first, after all.</li>\n<li><em>Good Omens</em>, by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman. This book is a hilarious send-up of all those ridiculous apocalypse books that hit the markets from time to time. Involving an angel and demon who are millennias-old drinking buddies, a misplaced antichrist, and the completely accurate prophecies of a witch named Nutter, this is one novel you do not want to pass by.</li>\n<li><em>Wicked</em>, by Gregory Maguire. A bit depressing, but worth it.</li>\n<li><em>The Mists of Avalon</em>, by Marion Zimmer Bradley. A book with a heady sense of myth if there ever was one.

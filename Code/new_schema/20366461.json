In fact, the only &#8220;C&#8221; I remember getting in elementary school was in handwriting (back when you received grades for that sort of thing). One time in fifth grade I tried to forge my mother&#8217;s signature on a report card because I realized that I had brought it back unsigned. I didn&#8217;t consider for one moment that the scrawling mess on the paper wouldn&#8217;t pass for my mother&#8217;s. Also, I didn&#8217;t realize that the name Barbara did not contain an &#8220;e&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, I was caught immediately, and my teacher called up the school&#8217;s police officer who informed me that what I did was illegal and I could go to jail. I&#8217;m pretty sure I am scarred for life.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-style:normal;line-height:23px;\">The Writing On The Wall.</span></h3>\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t until the end of college that my own handwriting improved. I was about to start student teaching in a first grade classroom; the teacher, an old dragon of a woman who was approaching thirty years of teaching, asked me to write something on the board. I had only written a couple of words when she stopped me and said, &#8220;<em>You</em> are not teaching <em>my</em> students with <em>that</em> handwriting!&#8221;</p>\n<p>She made me stay after school let out each day to practice my handwriting on the old black chalkboard, I kid you not. I felt like Bart Simpson in the opening credits. She wouldn&#8217;t let me write on the board in front of the students until my penmanship was up to par, which took some time. I am forever grateful for that woman, tough as she was.</p>\n<p>In my own classroom, I still teach handwriting. Some years I start of the year with it, and others I wait until my students beg me to teach them how to have beautiful cursive penmanship. This year my students are begging, so in the spring I will begin to teach it. The only thing I can&#8217;t do is grade them on it, as I learned from a sharp admonition from an administrator a few years ago.</p>\n<h3>Paying It Forward.</h3>\n<p>Recently, I gave a detention to one of my sixth grade boys for roughhousing, or something like that. He returned the following morning with his detention slip in hand. At one glance I knew that it wasn&#8217;t his dad&#8217;s signature, but I didn&#8217;t say anything.

vice principals\u2014both of them.</p>\n<p>They wanted to talk to me about my teaching methods and classroom management style. \u00a0In other words, they wanted to tell me how to teach my class. \u00a0Never you mind that I constantly employ best practices in my classroom. \u00a0That&#8217;s not the kind of stuff that really matters.</p>\n<h3>What I Learned From Administrators</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>I should not have a reading corner in my classroom, a pleasant area wherein students can relax and read when they are done with their classwork (best practice), because they cannot be properly monitored. \u00a0They should always sit at their desks, as uncomfortable as they are.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Students should not be allowed to listen to music as they work (best practice). \u00a0Does it matter that it helps students focus? \u00a0Nope.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Students should not be allowed to play educational games (best practice). \u00a0Games like <a href=\"http://www.freerice.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.freerice.com</a> that build vocabulary skills should not be played to give incentives for students finishing their work and achieving good scores.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li> Make sure that students pass, especially special education students. \u00a0Whether students turn in their work or not, whether they make an effort to learn or not\u2014they need to receive passing marks. \u00a0It&#8217;s not that it makes a difference in their moving on to the next grade level. \u00a0Students will go to the next grade whether they earn 50&#8217;s or 100&#8217;s, and no matter if they pass the state standardized tests. \u00a0It&#8217;s just that it makes the school look bad and requires more paperwork; that&#8217;s what matters.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What I Learned From Students</h3>\n<p>I went on to remove the comfy seats of the reading corner, and begin implementing the suggestions (directives) from my bosses. \u00a0The first thing that students asked as they came into the classroom was, &#8220;What happened to the reading corner? \u00a0Where did the seats go?&#8221;</p>\n<p>I had to go on to explain that students would no longer be able to sit in the back and read when their work was done. \u00a0They had to stay in their seats to read quietly. \u00a0They would no longer be allowed to listen to music as they worked. \u00a0They could certainly not be allowed to play online games if they finished their work.</p>\n<p>They were pissed. \u00a0All the rest of the day I had to tacitly explain that students could not partake in the things that previously motivated them to learn. \u00a0The comments from students ranged from &#8220;Why can&#8217;t we do this anymore?&#8221; to &#8220;This sucks&#8221; and &#8220;I hate this school.&#8221; \u00a0A couple of highly motivated students asked if they could write letters of complaint to the head principal about this.</p>\n<p>Way to go admin. \u00a0This is why students do not love school. \u00a0It is no longer a place of creating lifelong learners, but an oppressive environment aimed at producing high numbers on a spreadsheet (not that I should mention that in previous years my students have had some of the highest standardized test scores in the district).</p>\n<p>I guess my students and I both learned the same lesson today: school is not fun.</p>\n", "post_id": 77, "location": false, "date": "03-11-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["school", "middle school", "educator", "hair", "Good Hair", "buzz", "voodoo",

href=\"http://www.rachelschallenge.org\" target=\"_blank\">Rachel&#8217;s challenge</a>, was raising money for a family in need. In coming up with possible fundraising ideas, we threw around the typical penny war, baked goods sale, and car wash. But these were all chump change; we wanted to raise serious funds for a serious need\u2014a student and family experiencing a very difficult time, even for our demographic.</p>\n<p>Then the idea came: a buzz-off. There is nothing that kids want to see more than a teacher humiliated, and what better way than shaving teachers&#8217; heads live during a pep rally? That, surely, would be a big draw. This is where I come in. I was asked whether I would be willing to volunteer to have my head shaved for the fundraiser. Now, this is a pretty big request. I mean, I have good hair. I take pride in my stylish, tussled-yet-professional mane. After asking permission from the girlfriend,\u00a0I reluctantly agreed to put my coiffure to the chopping block.</p>\n<p>For each several hundred dollars raised, a different teacher would be slated to undergo the razor. I determined that my hair was worth at least $1,000. However, as my school is Title I, that was deemed a bit ambitious, and I had to settle for the $400 dollar mark (far below the true value of my gorgeous hair, and sadly ranked below the shorter hair of another administrator).</p>\n<p>Each day during lunch the donation jars were carted around, collecting funds, and the school was plastered with posters of the participating teachers&#8217; faces with the hair photoshopped out. At first it was rough, and not many donations were collected, but with the daily announcements and plenty of heckling from teachers, the dollars started to flow. One fellow teacher participating was awesome enough to mock his students by styling his hair just like several of his students throughout the week, including signs with their names worn around his neck.</p>\n<p>My students were incredibly and surprisingly passionate about the issue. \u00a0Some students told me they they would bring a hundred dollars just to see me have my head shaved (which is unlikely as most of my kids eat on <a href=\"http://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program-snap\">SNAP</a>, but hey, you never know). Other students were vehemently opposed to seeing my head without its glorious locks, and begged me not to do it. I didn&#8217;t know that my hairdo would cause such a reaction.</p>\n<p>There were a few students who definitely took it overboard. One of my students asked me if she could keep a lock of my hair. I gave her a glance of repudiation and said, &#8220;No. That&#8217;s <em>creepy</em>.&#8221; The last thing I need is to wake up at night in searing pain as a child twists a pin in her newly completed <a href=\"http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/voodoo-doll_163.jpg\">voodoo doll</a>.\u00a0Two of my other students drew a gravestone on my whiteboard and asked if we could have a moment of silence for my soon-to-be beheaded hair.</p>\n<p>Middle schoolers are weird.</p>\n<p>When the time finally came for the pep rally, students were mocking my hair, asking me if I was scared to lose it, cruelly telling me to kiss it goodbye. I mean, really? This is just hair, not Jesus before the Sanhedrin. Nonetheless, I was a little nervous, not because I am vain about my hair (which I am), but because I have a brilliantly germanic bone structure that just seems to shout, &#8220;Deutschland \u00fcber alles!&#8221;</p>\n<p>The pep rally itself had very little to do with our sports teams, who have not earned any accolades for some years, but we did have some sports group recognized for a moment after our band, choir, and cheerleaders all performed. There were a few silly teacher vs. student games, and then came the big moment, the finale. Two other teachers and myself were called out to the floor. It was announced that we had raised over $800 for this family\u2014pretty amazing for our student population.</p>\n<p>As we came down to the court, I could hear sixth graders chanting my name. It was strangely awesome. I felt like Petyon Manning, or rather, more like a Roman gladiator entering the Colosseum. We were seated, and behind us came the buzzing whir of three electric razors. Then as the whirring came close, hair began to fall in small heaps on the ground.</p>\n<p>Minutes later there we were, three teachers, sheared as sheep.</p>\n<p>I kept running my hands over my newly pared hair; it felt soft and fuzzy, but I was worried as to what I would see when I looked in a mirror. However, I had no need. As students exited the gym, one student came up to me and deftly said, &#8220;You look like Walter White.&#8221;\u00a0Ouch.</p>\n<p>Well, hair grows back, but until then I will be needing to wear my beanie, mostly because my head is cold, but also because kids keep asking to touch my head.

In the midst of explaining that copying the URL on a website wasn&#8217;t a sufficient citation, I heard some sort of banging noise in the hallway.</p>\n<p>I looked out of my door, and I didn&#8217;t see anything, but the sound was getting louder. It was the\u00a0pounding violent sound of hammers on metal. Oh, no.

There was nothing I could do until the storm passed over, so I continued to tutor my student on the ways of citation and talk to my coworker about tasty libations.</p>\n<p>A few minutes after\u00a0the terrible sound subsided, a fellow teacher ran into my room wide-eyed and frantic.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so sorry to interrupt, but you need to see your car.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Destroyed?&#8221; Considering the cacophony, it would be no surprise.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s pretty bad.&#8221;</p>\n<p>That was as good of a time as any to call it a day, so I sweep the student out of the room and walked upstairs with my coworker and out of the building to the parking lot, where half a dozen teachers were staring in disbelief at their cars.

The storm has been the talk of the town, and a picture of my poor car even made it into the local newspaper. Now my students are pelting me with questions about my car: Is it ruined? How are you going to get to school? Want my dad to fix it?</p>\n<p>Within the next few weeks, there will be a whole lot of teachers pulling up to school in their sweet new (and by that I mean used) rides.</p>\n<p>Hmmm\u2026maybe we should lobby for covered parking.</p>\n<p>(Just kidding; we don&#8217;t even have enough money to pay for remediation materials!)</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_830\" style=\"width: 250px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://aminusteacher.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/image.jpeg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-830\" src=\"https://aminusteacher.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/image.jpeg?w=240&#038;h=320\" alt=\"Ouch.\" width=\"240\" height=\"320\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Hail found by a coworker in the same neighborhood as our school.</p></div>\n", "post_id": 829, "location": false, "date": "04-14-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["middle school", "standardized testing", "testing", "educator", "teaching", "education", "teacher"], "text": "<p>Another year, another round of standardized testing.

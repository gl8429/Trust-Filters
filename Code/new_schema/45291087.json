I won\u2019t deny it. If you gave me the choice between a video and a piece of erotica, I\u2019d choose the video every time. I wouldn\u2019t care if the fiction was a literary fucking masterpiece, there\u2019s just something about seeing two plump lips wrapped around a cock\u2014taking one for the team\u2014that\u2019ll win that prize every time. I almost wanted to give the girl a hug.</p>\n<p>It didn\u2019t take long until I was begging for release. In fact, I\u2019d say this girl had done this once or twice before. She stood and pulled a condom from her purse, ripping it open in haste. Slipping it onto me, she discarded the foil on the floor. I yanked up her skirt and pressed my fingers inside of her, ensuring she was ready.</p>\n<p>I\u2019d seen this done in the movies\u2014I\u2019m pretty sure Armond did it in book two, as well\u2014and even though this woman couldn\u2019t have weighed much more than a hundred and twenty pounds, this was a hell of a lot harder than I thought it\u2019d be. I pulled her up onto me, fumbling and crashing against the wall. Three minutes passed before my arms started burning at the attempt to keep her in place. By that point, I was so far gone that I just wanted this whole thing to be done with. It was sexy, but it was exhausting.</p>\n<p>I pumped into her, keeping one hand gripping her knee and the other against the wall behind her shoulder. She yelped in pain\u2014in pleasure\u2014over and over, crying the name <em>Christoph.</em></p>\n<p><em>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </em>\u201cFuck,\u201d I muttered, feeling the orgasm build. That was another thing I\u2019d have to reconsider when writing sex scenes: Having an orgasm while standing? Not. Fucking. Easy. I was so focused on keeping her upright, keeping my dick from slipping out, making sure that if anyone walked in the door that I was being quiet enough, all the while still thrusting, still breathing, still trying to keep my facial expression somewhat attractive as I hit the peak, that I wasn\u2019t really concentrating on blowing my load. And dammit, my arms were about to burst into fucking flames.</p>\n<p>\u201cS\u00ed, s\u00ed Armond,\u201d she whispered.</p>\n<p>And that\u2019s all it took. I didn\u2019t have to come up with the perfect character response. And I didn\u2019t have to plan the dialogue, timeline, or worry about the flow of my narrative. The world that Christoph Strong lived in wasn\u2019t something <em>I\u2019d</em> created\u2014it was real\u2014and it surrounded me at that very moment.</p>\n<p>I snapped. I stopped thinking about the pain; I stopped worrying about whether or not someone would walk in. I was no longer concerned with whether or not I\u2019d say the right thing or be the right person. I stopped thinking about writing the character, and <em>became</em> him.</p>\n<p>I nipped ferociously at her bottom lip, grating my teeth against it as she cried out again. A sneer spread across on my face as I grabbed the backs of her thighs, slapping them against the tile. The velvety skin of her thighs displayed before me, like the in-flight wings of a monarch as I pinned the beautiful creature against the wall.</p>\n", "post_id": 28, "location": false, "date": "06-27-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p><a href=\"https://amaliesilver.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/bigballs-copy.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-42\" src=\"https://amaliesilver.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/bigballs-copy.jpg?w=187&#038;h=300\" alt=\"BIGBALLS copy\" width=\"187\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Big Balls<br />\n\u00a9 Amalie Silver 2014<br />\nNighttides anthology</p>\n<p><strong><em>Prologue</em></strong></p>\n<p>The first thing you need to know about the Beavers is that we\u2019re not quitters.</p>\n<p>We live the game.<br />\nWe breathe the game.<br />\nWe own it.</p>\n<p>Win or lose, it brings a spontaneous rush of adrenaline. A reflex. Something our bodies were designed to do.</p>\n<p>Fast-pitch softball was our way of life. And we aimed to perfect our game.</p>\n<p>I\u2019d spent three seasons with these ladies, and none of us would ever turn our backs on each other.</p>\n<p>Ever.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Chapter 1</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>April 14<br />\nGame 24<br />\n79 degrees Fahrenheit</strong><br />\n\u201cEverybody in!\u201d I called, taking off my catcher\u2019s mask.<br />\nOne by one the ladies jogged toward me, ceasing their warm-ups and stretches. Ponytails flopped loosely behind red caps, cleats crunched over the gravel, and gloves were taken off and tucked into armpits.<br />\n\u201cAll right. ladies. The game starts in five minutes. Up until last week, we were undefeated. So there are a couple of things I don\u2019t want repeated.\u201d I panned the field, looking for any stray red uniforms.<br />\n\u201cKelly, get your ass over here! And fix your pants.\u201d She walked over, and I lowered my voice to a rumble. \u201cYour camel toe is so obvious I feel like I should lead you to water.\u201d<br />\nThe ladies snickered.<br />\n\u201cOkay, like I was saying\u2026 We made some obvious mistakes last game. So Lilah,\u201d I looked to my left, letting my chin drop and my brow rise, \u201cif I catch you checking your manicure during a game when your eye should be on the ball, I\u2019m going to rip every one of those things off your fingers with a needlenose. Understood?\u201d<br />\nShe shamefully nodded.<br />\n\u201cGood. Jessy.\u201d My eyes shifted to the blonde standing at Lilah\u2019s side. \u201cI understand that we all have our personal problems. But you are to never again bring a breakup onto the field. Leave that shit at home.\u201d<br />\n\u201cSorry, Jacky,\u201d Jessy said, twisting her hair and looking down toward the grass.<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to date during the season, that\u2019s up to you. Just don\u2019t let it affect the team,\u201d I said with a tight nod.<br />\n\u201cAnd Becky,\u201d I added, finding her at my side. \u201cGet a sports bra. This isn\u2019t a striptease.\u201d<br />\nShe went to defend herself, but I put up my hand. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get into another discussion about the poor craftsmanship of our uniform\u2019s buttons.\u201d<br />\nBecky chewed the inside of her cheek and dropped her shoulders in defeat.<br />\n\u201cTonight is a doubleheader,\u201d I continued. \u201cBack to back, same team. We gotta show them who\u2019s boss right out of the gates. Remember,\u201d I pointed to my head, \u201cthis game is ninety percent psychological and twenty percent skill. I want to see everyone\u2019s one-hundred-and-ten out there tonight.\u201d<br />\nThey all swiftly nodded.<br />\n\u201cGood. Hands in!\u201d<br />\nWe piled our hands over each others\u2019. \u201cOn three. Ready?\u201d<br />\nIn unison, we shouted, \u201cOne. Two. Three. Beavers!\u201d<br />\nHome team had its advantages. Being first in the field meant we\u2019d close the game batting. Which would be necessary if we were behind by the ninth inning, but I had no intentions of letting it get to that point.<br />\nThat evening we were playing the Cougars.<br />\nThey were tough.<br />\nBut we were tougher.<br />\nWe\u2019d played them in the Division Championship last year, and we handed them their asses. We took the College World Series, too. But a lot of our seniors graduated last season, and a slew of freshmen and sophomores were added to our starting team. And although we had a strong team, we\u2019d still need a lot of work if we stood a chance at winning it all again this year.<br />\nNow, more than ever, it was vital that we stay focused and committed.<br />\nOur coach\u2019s name is Marny. She chews tobacco, wears cologne, and walks like she has a pair of testicles. She\u2019s not much of a talker and only pulls one of us aside if she notices a flaw in our technique. Otherwise she usually sits quietly keeping score on the bench.<br />\nThe team took their positions on the field. I was catcher. Izzy stood on the pitching mound, while Jessy jogged over to first base. Wanda stopped on her way to second base to pull up her sock, and Lilah was in the infield at shortstop tightening the knots on her shoes. Becky sat at third, smoothed the wrinkles from her uniform, and winked at a group of guys in the bleachers.<br />\nBut even with the hustle onto the field and the sounds of nearby traffic, birds chirping, children laughing, and the pings of aluminum bats at surrounding fields, I knew that as soon as the umpire walked onto the gravel, the girls could morph into fast-pitch softball killing machines.<br />\nFierce.<br />\nDetermined.<br />\nGreedy.<br />\nFocused.<br />\nOnce the outfielders got into position, I surveyed the team. The umpire walked from behind the backstop and I watched as each lady put on her game face. The heat of the evening was still bearing down, but I could feel a slight lift to the humidity as the sun began to set.<br />\nThe Cougars were dressed in their bright orange uniforms, and each one stood behind the backstop rooting for their first up to bat. Cleats were perched between the fencing, and fingers gripped the wire. They all chewed big wads of bubble gum and gave us the stink eye. Those girls looked a lot tougher than they were.<br />\nI squatted behind the plate and nodded to Izzy. Her eyes flickered toward the umpire and waited for his words.<br />\n\u201cPlay ball!\u201d he shouted.<br />\nMy insides flipped as I wiped the sweat from my brow just before sliding on my mask. I took one last look at the ladies, ensuring they were all in position.<br />\nEach one of them crouched; their eyes remained glued to the batter walking into the infield.<br />\nKayla was the first up to bat on the opposing team. Not that I didn\u2019t already know who she was, the position she played, and her batting average, but her teammates were behind me calling her name.<br />\nI took a deep breath and signaled the pitch. Izzy nodded and stood straight, keeping the ball and glove close to her chest.<br />\nWith a whip-like arm, she pulled it swiftly in a circular motion and took one step toward me, releasing the ball. But before I could feel it hit my glove, I heard the plinking echo of the ball making contact with the bat.<br />\nKayla had hit a line drive straight to Lilah at shortstop.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for Lilah, she didn\u2019t move her glove fast enough.<br />\nI heard the crunch of her kneecap from behind home plate just before I watched her fall to the ground.<br />\n\u201cHoly fuck!\u201d I yelled, running toward her and flipping off my mask. Lilah lay in the dirt, gripping her knee with both hands, as the ball rolled off into foul territory. She screamed, and then choked on her own vomit.<br />\n\u201cCall the fucking paramedics!\u201d I shouted and looked around at the stunned crowd surrounding the field.<br />\nWhen no one moved, I screamed even louder, \u201cNow!\u201d</p>\n<p><em>To read the rest of this novella, along with nine other sexy summer stories, visit the links below.</em></p>\n<p><span class=\"text_exposed_show\">US Amazon: <a href=\"http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB00MF4IEM0%2F&amp;h=JAQGBIaR-&amp;s=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow nofollow\">http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MF4IEM0/</a><br />\nUK Amazon: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Nighttides-Lisa-Suzanne-ebook/dp/B00MF4IEM0/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1407225589&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=nighttides\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow nofollow\">http://www.amazon.com/Nighttides-Lisa-Suzanne-ebook/dp/B00MF4IEM0/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1407225589&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=nighttides</a><br />\nBN: <a href=\"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/nighttides-lisa-suzanne-m-c-cerny/1120055655?ean=2940149651085\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow nofollow\">http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/nighttides-lisa-suzanne-m-c-cerny/1120055655?ean=2940149651085</a><br />\nKOBO: <a href=\"http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fstore.kobobooks.com%2Fen-US%2Febook%2Fnighttides&amp;h=RAQFGxy3k&amp;s=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow nofollow\">http://store.kobobooks.com/en-US/ebook/nighttides</a></span></p>\n", "post_id": 43, "location": false, "date": "08-30-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["#amaliesilver #hotforteacher #anthology #novella"], "text": "<p><a href=\"https://amaliesilver.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/debating-number-10-final.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-56\" src=\"https://amaliesilver.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/debating-number-10-final.jpg?w=187&#038;h=300\" alt=\"debating number 10 final\" width=\"187\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Debating Number Ten</strong><br />\n<strong> \u00a9 Amalie Silver</strong><br />\nHot for Teacher Anthology</p>\n<p><strong>Chapter One</strong><br />\nPresent Day</p>\n<p>Red toenails.<br />\nHigh arches.<br />\nThin ankles.<br />\nBlack stockings.<br />\nI had never wanted a woman more than I wanted Katie Shields\u2014or \u2018Miss Shields,\u2019 as I had been forced to always call her.<br />\nUntil this moment.<br />\nMy eyes wander higher to her calves, knees, and thighs as she sits on a white Chippendale chair at her vanity. I can almost taste her desperation from across the room as she stares me down with her hungry eyes.<br />\nWe\u2019ve both waited for this moment for too long.<br />\nAs she stands, she wastes no time in removing her clothes, and my dick twitches as I continue to watch from my place on the bed. She\u2019s putting on this show for me: each movement thought out, a slow torture.<br />\nAfter her clothes come off she stands in front of me with one finger in her mouth, looking down innocently at the bra and panties that remain. But if my prediction is correct, she\u2019ll leave them on for a while to taunt my imagination.<br />\nHer hand trails from her mouth to her cleavage, and her fingers brush between her perfect tits. My eyes sweep across her flat stomach and down to her black panties, where her thighs rub together in anticipation.<br />\n\u201cTouch me, Simon,\u201d she pleads.<br />\nMy eyes remain hooded as I rise from the bed. I take my time strolling toward her, staying in control the entire time, reassuring her that I\u2019m in command of this. The air leaves her chest, defining her ribs, making her breasts peak and her stance straighten.<br />\nThere\u2019s a slight apprehension in her eyes, an excited fear of the unexpected. It\u2019s a suspense that tickles both of our insides. And the smallest sound, taste, smell, or touch makes our skin feel like it\u2019s on sensory overload.<br />\nI reach my hand out to tuck a dark tendril of hair behind her ear, and her eyes flutter shut at my touch. I grip her chin and jerk her eyes to mine.<br />\n\u201cShame on you for making me wait so long.\u201d My firm hold keeps her head still, and I wait until her eyes grow lazy in submission before I appraise her body. Her skin is tan and supple, her lips red and plump. And her nipples poke through the satin of her bra.<br />\nI motion with a flick of my chin toward the bed. \u201cLie down.\u201d<br />\nShe nods timidly and crawls on top of the sheets.<br />\n\u201cStay there. Just like that.\u201d Her ass is straight up in the air and her thighs are spread slightly as she waits for me.<br />\nShe\u2019s so beautiful. Everything about her is perfection. She\u2019s my ideal woman in every way: from the small divot in her chin to her long black silky hair. To think I\u2019ve come as far as I have since the first day I laid eyes on her makes my chest expand with pride. But I need to take this slow\u2014slower than my greedy hands and dick have planned.<br />\nTo think about a woman for so long, so hard, and with such intensity; I\u2019ve played this moment over in my head thousands of times. Now that I\u2019m finally here, I need to savor her so that she\u2019s guaranteed to return for more. I can\u2019t blow this.<br />\nI strip down, removing my shirt, pants, and boxers, and crawl onto the bed. She\u2019s still lying submissively, her lips parted, her arms above her, and her eyes on me. My fingers dip underneath the thread of her panties, and her back arches as she exhales. With one yank I have the silk down to her knees, and her bare ass is in view. My eyes close and I sit back on my heels, privately thanking any god who can hear me. Miss Shields must hear me make a sound, because she giggles, and my eyes open.<br />\n\u201cTurn over, Katie.\u201d<br />\nShe quickly follows my orders and lies on her back. I remove her panties slowly until she has nothing on but her bra. \u201cTake it off,\u201d I demand.<br />\nReaching behind, she unclasps her bra, letting the material hover over her chest as a tease, and I know she\u2019s enjoying every second of this.<br />\n\u201cI\u2019ve wanted you for so long, Simon.\u201d Her words sing to me and echo in my ears.<br />\n\u201cI know, baby.\u201d I snatch her bra away and throw it to the floor. For a moment she looks shy, covering herself with her forearms. I ease myself on top of her and pin her arms to her sides, just before taking her dark nipple into my mouth.<br />\nI can\u2019t seem to slow myself; I\u2019m too needy for her. I want all of her at once: her skin, her hair, her tits, her pussy, and that beautiful ass\u2014everything she\u2019ll give me. Even though I know she\u2019s a woman I should take my time with, I feel ravenous and Katie Shields is my only satisfaction. I open her thighs wide, and dip down to taste her. Shuddering, I delight in her exquisite flavor.<br />\nHer body is immaculate, tender, and ripe for me as I dip my tongue inside her. She\u2019s drenched, and I feel another stab of pride knowing that I was the one to get her there. I hum a vibration against her, and she rewards me by whispering my name.<br />\nHer hips begin to move against me and her fingers find my hair. She pulls gently, rocking against my face and uttering small, sweet groans. A smile spreads across my face as I stop and look up at her.<br />\nGliding her hands down to her nipples, she tweaks and twists them, and I think briefly about asking her to pleasure herself for me. But I realize there\u2019s no way I\u2019d allow it; I want to be buried deep inside of her.<br />\nI slam my body forward, keeping her knees at my shoulders. Her body shifts quickly with mine and she grunts unexpectedly, causing my smile to turn wicked. I can feel her pussy at the tip of my cock, begging for me to intrude her, but instead I tease her with it.<br />\nHer lips stay parted in surprise, and I take my opportunity to indulge in a kiss. I keep a firm hold of her thighs at my shoulders while I take her mouth onto mine.<br />\nIt\u2019s frenzied and eager, and I make no apologies for it. My mouth is wet, and tastes like my Katie. This seems to make her appetite shift into overdrive, and she\u2019s just as impatient when she kisses me back.<br />\nWithout notice I thrust myself inside of her, and the sensation shocks her. She holds her breath and throws her head back.<br />\nShe\u2019s tighter than I thought she\u2019d be\u2014or perhaps she\u2019s waited all these years for only me.<br />\nI ease out of her slowly and back in again. Jesus, she\u2019s wet. I take my mouth away from hers and watch her face contort in pained gratification. Her eyes are squinted and she\u2019s lets out a breath. Black hair cascades on the pillow, and she catches her bottom lip between her teeth. I move my hips slowly at first, and she moans with pleasure.<br />\nI pick up the pace, grinding myself in deeper\u2014harder\u2014and I know there\u2019s no way either of us will last long. Our bodies are too damn perfect for one another\u2019s for more than five minutes of this. So I close my eyes and soak in every moment I can.<br />\n\u201cSimon,\u201d she whispers.<br />\nMy pace is vigorous, and I barely hear her. My tongue is circling her areola, and when I hear the echo of her voice, my thrust quickens even more as I trap her small nipple between my teeth, feeling it pucker.<br />\nI\u2019m so damn close\u2014within seconds of coming. I feel the orgasm build as waves of euphoria encompass me.<br />\n\u201cSimon?\u201d<br />\n\u201cHoly shit,\u201d I sputter, unable to tame it any longer. She grips my hair harder, my thrusts become fiercer, and I lose any semblance of control as I pound into her, reveling as the last of the orgasm rips through. I grind my body against hers and I come quietly, yet crudely.</p>\n<p>\u201cSimon? You in there?\u201d I hear the voice again along with a knock at my door. My heart races wildly as I open my eyes up and reach for the towel on the floor.<br />\n\u201cYeah, Ma. I\u2019m here. I\u2019m\u2026resting,\u201d I manage to choke out, feeling hot and flustered.<br />\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll leave you alone. We just got home and we\u2019re going to go to bed,\u201d Mom says quietly through the door.<br />\nI swallow. \u201cOkay. Goodnight.\u201d I clean myself off and throw the towel on my nightstand, knocking over the bottle of lotion, which makes me roll my eyes.<br />\nAfter putting my boxers back on, I climb into my empty bed and close my laptop, still feeling frustrated.<br />\nI don\u2019t know how much longer this fantasy of my teacher will suffice. I want her so desperately sometimes that I wonder if my dick will explode if I don\u2019t feel her wrapped around it soon.<br />\nI turn on to my side and close my eyes, thinking of her gorgeous face when I\u2019ll see her at debate next week.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTINUE READING: </strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OYUMKD2/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OYUMKD2/</a><strong><br />\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong>SEE MORE SNIPPETS FROM OTHER STORIES IN THE HOT FOR TEACHER ANTHOLOGY HERE:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.wickedwomenbooksandmore.com/hot-for-teacher-anthology/\">Hot For Teacher Anthology!</a>.

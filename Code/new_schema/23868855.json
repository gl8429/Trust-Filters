{"node_id": 23868855, "posts": [{"tags": [], "text": "<p>Hi. I am a mother of Elka. She is my first baby and an absolute joy.</p>\n<div>I thought I would share some of my daily experiences as a mummy, and some of my friend&#8217;s thought and ideas about motherhood. We live in northern NSW, and I am not sure if it is because we live in the vicinity of the magical Byron Bay &#8211; home of hippy happy yummy mummies &#8211; or if it is simply coincidence, but I think we are doing a really lovely job of being new mums.</div>\n<div>There&#8217;s a lot of hype about motherhood. And on the whole I agree with the cliches &#8211; it changes your life, it&#8217;s fulfilling, it&#8217;s the best thing you ever do and all that. But of course there are some things the not-so-earthy-mother in me finds challenging &#8211; such as staying in doors with your babe in arms whatever the weather, finding time to clean and organise the house in a domestic goddess like way, finding time to bake home-made bread also in a domestic goddess fashion&#8230;hmm. But I guess the ever-present, over-riding factor is that sweet little toothy grin, smiling at you\u00a0<em>so</em>\u00a0lovingly it&#8217;s heartbreaking&#8230;.makes the lack of breadmaking worthwhile.</div>\n<div>My journey into being a mum was planned, and well-timed. I have a loving and happy relationship with a guy I have been with for about four years. He&#8217;s eight years older than me, but for both of us, the time was very right to have a baby.</div>\n<div>We talked about it on and off over the years, and then one day decided to make it happen, for real. We were one of the lucky couples who were able to conceive almost instantaneously. And from the word go, it was a very safe, and comfortable pregnancy. No morning sickness, little stress, good hormones flying.</div>\n<div>In the midst of it, we decided to move from Melbourne to northern NSW, which seems huge, but really was just a minor part of the whole period. My body was changing, my mind was changing, as this amazing thing grew within. Moving, or anything else for that matter, paled in significance.<br />\nThe due-date came and went, and two weeks of trying everything &#8220;natural&#8221; like acupuncture, herbs, curry and ..ahem&#8230;hot sex (well, hottish, given the fact that my husband was completely not turned on by our baby&#8217;s head very near to the whole saga)&#8230; still<em>nada</em>. I was planning to birth at the natural birth clinic near Alstonville &amp; Lismore, so 14 days over due was really pushing the envelope when it comes to safe practice. A day longer, and I would have needed to be induced in hospital. Fortunately I had Australia&#8217;s best obstetrician on watch, and an amazing mid-wife, and her equally amazing support person. In the end, Castor-oil did the trick.</div>\n<div>In our waiting period, Christmas came and went, and New Years 2010 was looming. The Castor-oil worked its magic at about 7pm New Years Eve. We sat around the pool eating dinner with neighbours of the birth centre, when the contractions began, thick and fast. My first stage was only about 4-5 hours (who knows exactly &#8211; it was a blur), and was very intense. By midnight, fireworks were cracking over Alstonville, the full moon (a blue one at that) hung high in the sky, and I was fully dilated. My baby was crowning. She continued to do so, though, for several hours. So in the end, I was maneuvered backwards into a Hyundai Excel, hanging face down over the front seat, bum in the air. My ever-cautious partner panicked secretly, but we made it safely to the hospital. An on-call obstetrician oversaw the procedure (as it turns out, Australia&#8217;s best obstetrician was out celebrating the dawn of a new decade) and our baby girl was born at 3.13am. She came out&#8230;big! and healthy and rosy. As any new parent will tell you, it was an amazing moment, compared to no other.I felt pretty up and down the first week. We stayed at the birth centre on a beautiful property under the care of qualified lactation consultants. I can&#8217;t imagine how people do without such support, because even then, I was a bit of a basket case. The baby howled, especially at 1am in the morning. My boobs hurt, I felt anxious about&#8230;well, everything. Especially how I was going to do this whole mothering thing! I felt separated from my partner, cranky and lost in an unknown world, not sure if I had done the right thing by deciding to have a child, and frightened by the fact that things would never go back to how they were. It was rocky, but I made it through.</p>\n</div>\n<div>The first three months were pretty much a blur. I barely remember them. There was a lot of rocking, singing Leonard Cohen&#8217;s<em>Hallelujah</em>\u00a0and bouncing on the gym ball. One of the highlights &#8211; make that a pinnacle &#8211; came when someone warned me that bouncing on the gym ball regularly could cause brain damage to your baby&#8230;! You can imagine the freak out and despair I felt after such a comment. Everything is hanging by a thread in that first period &#8211; your sanity, your patience, your relationship. All you need is something to tip you over the edge. (By the way, we researched into this &#8220;fact&#8221; about bouncing = brain-damage, and in fact discovered it was a piece of &#8220;fiction&#8221; &#8211; at least that is what relevant websites say.)</div>\n<div>I was saved because<br />\n1. I didn&#8217;t ever get too tired &#8211; I was co-sleeping, and found I went back to sleep extremely easily after each feed, and sometimes during.<br />\n2. I walked &#8211; excessively. One of the only ways to get baby to sleep was walking quickly up and down the hills of Lismore with her in a sling.<br />\n3. I had a husband who was very supportive, especially in the cooking and washing up department.<br />\n4. I socialised.</div>\n<div>For me, the social aspect of mothering is crucial. I know people talk about &#8220;Baby Moon&#8221;s and staying in to get to know your baby, but I needed to get out! I needed to share my experiences, talk to other women, and hear other mother&#8217;s stories. I needed nurturing as much as possible.<br />\nAnd hence, when the three months were over, and baby girl only cried when she needed something I knew how to respond to, and became an absolute delight, I was in one piece, and in fact doing very well.</div>\n<p><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/photo.jpg\"><img src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/photo.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<div>Six months later, every day still gets better. It really is wonderful, this thing they call being a mother. When your baby laughs, when your days are filled with wonder at the changes, at their ability (and your own ability) to become absolutely engrossed in the present moment, their precious soft skin&#8230;there are endless things that make this journey magical.</div>\n", "post_id": 1, "location": false, "date": "06-02-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["play", "gt", "family", "father", "mothering", "rubber ducks", "children"], "text": "<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/duckies.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image aligncenter\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/duckies.jpg?w=492&#038;h=403\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"492\" height=\"403\" /></a></p>\n<p>Three little duckies go with Elka wherever she goes. Mummy Duck, Daddy Duck and Elka Duck. They go in the bath and in the shower. Elka watches her flock fondly as they paddle in the baby pool outside. She makes them a bed out of straw in the garden. It is the sweetest thing to see three little duckies all in a row in the middle of the garden. Sometimes they line up on Elka&#8217;s outdoor table setting and watch her eat an ice-block.</p>\n<p>We three little duckies do most things together too. We shower together, bathe together, eat together and sleep together. Sometimes Daddy ducky goes to work and sometimes Mummy ducky has to work from home or make baby-cinos for people. But wherever possible, three little duckies travel together.</p>\n<p>The Mummy ducky-Elka ducky bond has always been strong. Two duckies dependent on one another for love. In recent times, as Mummy ducky has spread her yellow wings and tentatively ventured into the world to make baby-cinos for people, Daddy ducky\u00a0and Elka duckie have spent more time alone together, which has been wonderful for their relationship.</p>\n<p>The duckies speak dutch, laugh and play music. They make a sandpit together, go to the park, and swim in the pool. Occasionally, they share a cookie and Elka duck has a baby-cino and Daddy duck has a coffee. Daddy duck gazes at his little duckling as she sleeps with a smile nearly bursting his face. &#8220;She makes me so happy,&#8221; he quacks.</p>\n<p>Elka duck has always had her daddy to thank for teaching her mother patience. For encouraging co-sleeping and sling carrying. For banning controlled crying in any shape or form. For ensuring that no ducky in our household will ever be spanked or yelled at. Now, as Elka duck no longer requires attachment to her mother duck 24 hours a day, she may enjoy all that her daddy duck has to offer. She can follow in his silly ducky footsteps. She can make up silly songs with her silly ducky dad.</p>\n<p>Three little duckies sitting together in a row.

Surprisingly, it didn&#8217;t take that long to make. So&#8230;crappy photos of an excellent creation. The joy of The Elka Book lasted for about 5 minutes, until Elka took it in the car with her and for the first time ever got car sick, spewed pancakes and yoghurt all over the pages and I think a few pieces never made it out of the washing machine. But the process was fun&#8230;and well-intended. Just more inspiration to never attempt a craft project ever ever again.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">On other Elka Book related news, we received a gorgeous parcel today from my friend Margot&#8217;s mother. <a href=\"http://heartmama.net/2011/11/28/a-little-ritual-in-ones-life/\">Margot was my school friend</a> who died in a car accident eight years ago. It was so awful to lose such a special person. Elka&#8217;s second name is Margot, so a little piece of her will live on to the next generation&#8230;Margot&#8217;s mother, who we are still close to, wanted to find a way to make Margot real for Elka. So she made a book. It is gorgeous. It is called Margot&#8217;s Farm and using photos, traces the life of the farm through the seasons and through different orchards. Molly, the boarder collie, features throughout, as does Margot, who plants the grapes with her dad and makes hot cross buns. We sat together tonight with &#8220;Dinie&#8217;s book about Margot&#8221; as it is fondly named, Elka reading along and pointing out where the doggy is and the rainbow, which she aptly called &#8220;Margot&#8217;s rainbow&#8221;. It is amazing how children are so receptive to ceremony and sentiment. Margot certainly became more real for Elka this evening.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The fog has cleared and I can see!

Most people from Melbourne visit Byron in winter from a reprieve from the cold. We should just count our blessings I suppose.</p>\n<p>So for a month there, many of my regular partners in crime had absconded to far flung places across the globe, including my Mum who was in Bali for a month. I think I have explained previously that I am not much the stay at home mum. On the fews days a week Greg works, I frantically busy myself with social engagements and outings. We have had yoga on a Wednesday, the afternoon was usually spent at a friend&#8217;s place or at the park. Friday we would jet off to Ballina or somewhere equally as groovy, and have a walk along the river or something nice. So when many of my buddies were away, I found myself venturing uncharted\u00a0waters and looking for new adventures.</p>\n<p>I tried Mainly Music at the Uniting Church Hall &#8211; a half hour of boisterous singing and dancing, followed by morning tea. It was fun&#8230;a whole new group of people to get to know and I enjoyed watching Elka in the think of things, racing around with unfamiliar toys and other children. It was the closest she&#8217;s come to day care, and I think she had a good time.</p>\n<p>The following Wednesday, we ventured farther afield, to a little school in Wyralla which really is in a field. It&#8217;s beautiful, looking over incredible scenery. A group of mothers meet there weekly. They have craft, and toys and morning tea. Again, it was nice to chat to a few new people, and allow Elka to explore a new environment.</p>\n<p>I know if you are looking, there is a play group somewhere just about every day. Up until now, I have been spoiled by my fantastic mum&#8217;s group who meet weekly. So I haven&#8217;t felt the need to reach out and connect with other mums in the region. But this week was fun&#8230;and maybe next time my friends flee the continent, I will go back and try a different group. Just for the experience.</p>\n", "post_id": 103, "location": false, "date": "06-09-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["quitting", "family", "study", "commitment", "children", "mother", "university"], "text": "<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/dandy.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/dandy.jpg?w=292&#038;h=389\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"292\" height=\"389\" /></a></p>\n<p>I quit uni. Yesterday afternoon, I was under slept, coldy, and got up at 6:30am to go to a Lifeline shift. I felt like shite. I couldn&#8217;t quite fathom how everything could possibly fit into my life. Here is a list of my current (or previous) commitments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Raising one small child full-time</li>\n<li>Doing part-time psychology honours</li>\n<li>Doing part-time writing work, which is about 40 hours per book and I have two books to do in two months</li>\n<li>Working in a caf\u00e9 every Saturday and sometimes Friday as well</li>\n<li>Doing a Lifeline shift every fortnight</li>\n<li>Co-facilitating a mother&#8217;s support group once a week in Alstonville</li>\n<li>Blogging</li>\n<li>Running <a href=\"http://motherink.org\">Mother Ink</a>, a website for women to share their mothering experiences</li>\n<li>Maintaining a relationship with my husband</li>\n<li>Maintaining lots of wonderful friendships</li>\n<li>Going to playgroup once a week</li>\n<li>Keeping my house semi-organised and de-moulded</li>\n<li>Keeping a crop of pumpkins under control</li>\n<li>Did I mention trying to raise a two year old effectively?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Oh yeah, I am also three months pregnant!</p>\n<p>Luckily, I get a lot of support, but this list is ridiculous, isn&#8217;t it? Remarkably, I have only been seriously stressed about twice, and yesterday was one of those days. Sitting in the car, returning home after a weekend away and late nights, nothing my husband said could console me.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Well quit uni then,&#8221; he said (as uni is the one commitment I dread and dislike).</p>\n<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t bloody quit uni!&#8221; I yelled, &#8220;because then next year and every year after I will have two kids and it will only get harder! And knowing the psychology association, they will change the rules and I will have to do even more study!&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;OK, so don&#8217;t quit. Now let&#8217;s work out how to be happy about it and get through the next five weeks&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Crap. I felt crap. That was a crap solution. I moaned the rest of the way home, and slammed the door as I got out of the car. Two minutes later, I am on the phone to uni trying to work out the solution. No, I can&#8217;t defer my course. Yes, I can reapply next year. And no, it seemed unlikely much would change in the next few years.</p>\n<p>Half an hour later, my finger was hovering over the CONFIRM DISCONTINUE button. Is quitting really the answer? I have done it before, many many a time. In fact, quitting uni courses is my forte. But in this case, Superwoman would survive, and I know I would too if I continued on as is. But would I be sane? Would I have a social life? Would I be able to do any of it particularly well? The answer to all these questions is: probably not. And so, I pressed confirmed, and suddenly it was all over.</p>\n<p>I feel good, particularly when I think about those two text books I no longer need to read before the end of April, and those two essays I don&#8217;t need to do before we go to Europe in May. My priorities are my daughter, my pregnancy and my husband. Whatever else can&#8217;t fit on the plate must get off. And so it is, nine (or more) discontinued uni courses later, I will be a better mother, friend and partner because of it.</p>\n", "post_id": 1031, "location": false, "date": "03-26-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["ethical consumer's guide", "shopping", "organic", "ethical shopping"], "text": "<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.newint.com.au/shop/pics/p292-1_230.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>We try to be ethical shoppers. Today I bought my groceries from a local general store called Baz and Shaz&#8217;s, and bought organic butter, organic milk, organic green tea and organic veges. Where we can, we buy local. When we can afford it, we buy organic.</p>\n<p>Recently a friend introduced us to <a href=\"http://www.ethical.org.au\">The Ethical Consumer&#8217;s Guide</a>\u00a0&#8211; Love. This. Site. I realised, trawling through, that we don&#8217;t actually buy many brands. We go through one tube of toothpaste a year, and all our soaps, detergents and shampoos are herbal concoctions from the local health food shop. There are a few culprits, though, according to the <a href=\"http://www.ethical.org.au\">ethical guide.</a>\u00a0Our one annual tube of toothpaste is Colgate. We buy it so we get some fluoride as our local water isn&#8217;t\u00a0fluorinated. Colgate, owned by Colgate-Palmolive, are an American company that tests on animals, fixes prices, uses excessive amounts of water, has bad wastage policies, refuses to sign the compact for safe cosmetics, and scored 3/15 for the <a href=\"http://www.ethiscore.org/\">ethiscore</a>.</p>\n<p>Vaalia were another disappointment. Vaalia make the only natural yoghurt that Elka enjoys eating without any added sweetener. Vaalia are owned by French company Parmalat, and get a big fat cross for their poor palm oil policy. They have also been criticised for massive financial fraud.</p>\n<p>We have Scotch-Brite sponges. Won&#8217;t be buying them again. Scotch-Brite are owned by an American company, which tests on animals and has involvement in Burma.</p>\n<p>Coles, where we shop when we have to, own gaming related businesses. They are owned by Wesfarmers, which also owns a coal mine and has 40% interest in a second mine. Woolworths are even worse.</p>\n<p>Most people I know are ethical shoppers, and I think shopping ethically is a trend that continues to grow. You can vote with your dollar by choosing ethical brands instead of unethical brands. I am going to try to buy more organic, even if it means a couple less coffees a week. It&#8217;s one way I can support the organic industry, and hopefully in time, growing with chemicals will be phased out and we will return to healthier living.</p>\n<p>One ethical\u00a0Hessian\u00a0shopping bag at a time.</p>\n", "post_id": 1055, "location": false, "date": "03-30-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["emotion", "love", "family", "parenting", "kindness", "affection"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/p1010822.jpg\"><br />\n<img class=\"aligncenter\" title=\"Elka\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/p1010822.jpg?w=480&#038;h=376\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"376\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I am still hanging out for those <a href=\"http://heartmama.net/2012/02/01/the-terribly-titchy-twos/\">terrible twos</a> to begin.

Heaven sent to improve us mere mortals, educating us in the ways of kindness, love and affection. A few scenarios to enlighten you about her glorious nature&#8230;</p>\n<p>Recently, my husband got into a bit of a debate with someone close to us. Tension flicked between them, but for Elka&#8217;s sake, and everyone else&#8217;s, my husband composed himself, hiding his emotion behind a blank expression. Elka sidled up and held his shorts. She looked up at her daddy and asked: &#8220;Poppy, are you OK?&#8221; She stroked his leg with her warm little hand.</p>\n<p>On the weekend, I was staying at my parents, and I feverishly eyed off my father&#8217;s iPad in all its iGlory. &#8220;Can I have a turn, Dad?&#8221; I asked.<br />\n&#8220;Sure,&#8221; he says, &#8220;but <em>please</em> be careful!&#8221; I promised I will, but as I am handing it back across the table, it slips from its protective sleeve and lands face down with a bang.<br />\n&#8220;Bloody hell!&#8221;<br />\n&#8220;Shit, sorry!&#8221; Voices erupt in dismay.<br />\nSuddenly, Elka is at my side. &#8220;It&#8217;s OK Mama, don&#8217;t worry,&#8221; she says, with the wisdom of the Dalai Lama. &#8220;It&#8217;ll be alright.&#8221; Of course, she was right, and we had all acted erratically. It only took a two year-old to bring us back to reality.</p>\n<p>Elka spends most of the day listening to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_S2Y-z0jzWw\">&#8220;The Smartest Giant in Town&#8221;</a>, by Julia Donaldson, on audio CD. The giant is sad because he&#8217;s scruffy. The giraffe is sad because his neck is cold. The mice are sad because their house burnt down. The fox is sad because he dropped his sleeping bag in a puddle. &#8220;Poor giant,&#8221; says Elka, her head cocked to one side, &#8220;really sad!&#8221; And so she continues to sympathise with the ill fortune of the characters in the book. Elka applies the same sentiment to most things &#8211; dollies, teddies, <a href=\"http://heartmama.net/2012/03/13/three-little-duckies/\">duckies&#8230;</a>\u00a0&#8220;Oh, poor {insert name here}. Really sad!&#8221; She prescribes breastfeeding, hugs or walking them singing\u00a0<em>Hallelujah</em>.</p>\n<p>Sharing has been an issue much discussed amongst friends with toddlers. Believe me, Elka has had her &#8220;Mine!&#8230;No! It&#8217;s MINE!&#8221; days. But mostly, she approaches a child with an outstretched hand bearing a gift. &#8220;Here you go,&#8221; she offers with her kind, warm voice and her doey brown eyes intent on revealing her best intentions. Having \u00a0very recently been shy, or so she told us, only yesterday she was in a cafe sandpit when she approached a child she had never met before with a toy from the sand. &#8220;Here you go&#8230;do you want to play with this one?&#8221; The child, flabbergasted at the generosity, accepted her gift and the two played merrily until the babycino arrived.</p>\n<p>When I take her on the toilet, she says, &#8220;Thank you Mama. Thank you for helping me.&#8221; She asks politely for things she wants. She thanks us for everything she is given. We honestly made no attempt to teach her manners.</p>\n<p>Elka is also affectionate. Always a co-sleeper and a sharer of blankets, she has recently taken to sharing my pillow and tickles my ears with each hand as she falls asleep. She breathes sweet milky breath directly into my face. I have to admit, I love it. If she has had a conversation with you for more than a minute or if her parents kiss you goodbye, good luck leaving without a big fat Elka-kiss on the lips. If you kiss her cheek, she will request a rematch. If you are related or spend any amount of quality time with her, she will cuddle into you on the couch and press her little head into your chest.</p>\n<p>She loves like I have never seen another person love. Sometimes she gets &#8220;cwanky&#8221; but she&#8217;ll own it, and name it and not reject you or blame you for how she feels. She will rationally explain her state as caused by tiredness or hunger or thirst or just because she&#8217;s cwanky. Usually, she will self-medicate with a bottle of milk or <a href=\"http://heartmama.net/2012/02/23/its-playschool/\">Playschoo</a>l to &#8220;feel better&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Although my husband and I are generally kind to one another and try to be kind to those we know, I can&#8217;t quite believe how kind and sweet our daughter is. Where does she get such wisdom? As a tiny baby, she taught me patience, strength and resilience. As she grows, she teaches me kindness, love and forgiveness. Although I have a supportive husband and family, it is Elka that makes my life as a mother easy. I glide through without barely a whimper because she is magic.</p>\n<p>Whatever becomes of you, Elka, piercings, tattoos or inappropriate leather-lad boyfriends, I would just like you to know that when you were two, you weren&#8217;t terrible. You were angelic.\u00a0<a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/p1010822.jpg\"><br />\n</a></p>\n", "post_id": 1057, "location": false, "date": "04-02-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["emotion", "love", "family", "parenting", "rejection", "children"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/mother-and-child.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1064\" title=\"mother-and-child\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/mother-and-child.jpg?w=480&#038;h=370\" alt=\"http://sufipoetry.wordpress.com/2009/11/04/mai-ni-main/\" width=\"480\" height=\"370\" /></a></p>\n<p>The time has come for this little mama to take off her crown of &#8220;most loved in the world&#8221; and hand it to the other main contestant&#8230;Daddy.</p>\n<p>I know it&#8217;s irrational.

Tears don&#8217;t come easily any more. Once a wet blubbery mess now I only choke up when someone wins a race or the love birds get together at the end of the movie. For whatever reason, a wall came up at some point \u00a0and dammed the river.</p>\n<p>Yesterday though was enough to break the wall. Two days of &#8220;I want my <a href=\"http://http://heartmama.net/2012/04/05/a-new-leaf/\">Daddy</a>&#8221; and then a tired little girl crying herself silly because she couldn&#8217;t get herself to sleep. We pulled over in the Ballina botanical gardens and I thought I would take her in the sling to get her to sleep. I thought it would nurture our mother-daughter bond. Instead, she screamed louder &#8220;I want my Daddy!&#8221;, her face a wet mess. At that point the wall came down, and beside a lake of lily pads dappled with sunlight, I howled.</p>\n<p>For the first time, in her distress, my daughter didn&#8217;t want me. I couldn&#8217;t help her. The pain was unforgivable.</p>\n<p>I know it wasn&#8217;t rational. My husband rationally explained the situation away. But I couldn&#8217;t escape the hurt. So much of my motherhood and contentedness of the last two years has hinged on the fact that I have felt unconditional boundless love. Now it felt that conditions applied and it was just little old me alone in the world. Let&#8217;s not kid ourselves that kids complete us and we will never feel lonely again.</p>\n<p>In my husband&#8217;s rational explanation I found one strand to hold onto, although it seemed ludicrous. A few days ago Elka very reasonably decided that I couldn&#8217;t carry her in the sling because I was carrying a baby and she was too heavy for me. So she would go with Daddy. Very reasonable. And only days later, I was insisting on carrying her in the sling, despite it being bad for me and the baby. It was just possible that in her mind this all made sense.</p>\n<p>That evening, she graciously allowed me to put her to bed, and snuggled into me. She was sad that I had to go to work this morning. And then after work, when I was carrying her, she said, &#8216;No, Mummy you have a baby. I am too heavy. Daddy can carry me.&#8217;</p>\n<p>Is it possible that I can still underestimate the emotional intelligence and kindness of my daughter? A new leaf was turned, only to reveal a deeper and more considerate side to my child. Whoever says that children under three are egotistical are wrong. And whoever says that motherhood is a selfless act only need hear my story. I am just as selfish in motherhood as I ever was. Perhaps I should open my heart to my child and learn more.</p>\n", "post_id": 1067, "location": false, "date": "04-07-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["plaza", "shopping", "monopoly", "Coles", "parenting", "david and goliath", "village"], "text": "<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/rummuser.com/wp-content/uploads/david-vs-goliath.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>I live in a village where people buy fruit and veges from the fruit and vege shop (even though the previous owner displayed more fruit flies than fruit), two little bakers run a thriving business and two butchers do too. We have a health food shop, a couple of chemists, Mitre 10, a bottle shop, a newsagent, a video store, a post office, a shoe-fixer, a pub and a whole lot of cafes. That&#8217;s about it. Oh, and then there is Coles. We have everything we need. And like your traditional village, the villagers utilise the services where they can before driving to the bigger neighbouring towns.</p>\n<p>Recently, the man who own the village plaza passed away and his two sons took charge. They painted the very daggy plaza, put in a wheelchair ramp (or pram ramp, if you are looking at it from my perspective), new toilets and a new roof. Then they gave a couple of months notice to the tenants that their leases would not be renewed, because Coles has plans to extend. Coleswill put in a bakery and a bottle shop. How thoughtful of them to try to put at least three of our local businesses out of business. The consequence of this is that the health food shop is closing down in two weeks, the owner looses the sale she had lined up and is left with a business loan to pay back and a whole lot of organic muesli. Mitre 10 will no longer be able to sell, and there goes the owners&#8217; superannuation. A new owner recently took over the fruit shop. The fruit flies have gone, but I hope he won&#8217;t. It&#8217;s tragic. I effing hate corporations and their monopoly over&#8230;everything.</p>\n<p>I successfully boycotted Coles for two weeks after hearing the news. The local businesses supply everything I need, except organic milk. But then my milk shopping leaked into everything-else-that-was-on-display-shopping, as only Coles has the power to do. My basket went from empty to overflowing by the time I reached the checkout. This morning, I asked the fruit shop owner if he would stock organic milk, and he said &#8220;Sure&#8230;how much do you need a week?&#8221; It was that simple. I can resume my boycott until the poor little health food shop closes its doors and I need to go to Coles for tea and flour.</p>\n<p>It makes me so mad when the big guys always win, and money rules everything. Why can&#8217;t we continue to be the village where people buy from local businesses to the support them and support our village? It&#8217;s like Coles specifically analysed how our village works and thought, well the bakeries do well, the bottle shop seems to do well, let&#8217;s stock up our vitamin counter and we can close down half of this town.</p>\n<p>I was trying to think of an analogy and the best I could come up with was David and Goliath&#8230;but in this situation, the giant takes one look at David and spits on his head before stamping him into the ground.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://rummuser.com/?p=2733\">Image credit</a></p>\n", "post_id": 1073, "location": false, "date": "04-12-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>Yesterday afternoon, Elka decided not to nap, and instead took the Cranky Noodle option.

Lying awake, listening to the church bell dime four times was like torture, knowing I would not go back to sleep. My main concern, of course, was that I would at some point have to move or sneeze, which would wake Elka. It&#8217;s funny how the priority of travelling AC (After Children) becomes ensuring the child in question gets enough sleep. When travelling BC (Before Children), the priority was deciding which museum to go to and which pub to drink at.</p>\n<p>We are well rested now. I suppose that was the famous Jetlag in action.</p>\n<p>We are in The Netherlands&#8230;a country of bikes, cheese and rainy weather. I love it here. I love the healthy faces bitten by cold as people ride just about every where &#8211; holding hands, talking on phones and never wearing helmets. I love the endless variety of cheese. I don&#8217;t love the rain, because after an Australian summer of endless rain, I am over it. But I love the neat gardens &#8211; tiny packages of blooming magnolia, perfect hydrangea and weeping cherry blossoms. I love the old buildings, huddled together as if keeping warm. I love the stylish, interesting shops full of beautiful quality things. I love walking through the forest on paths lined with birch, with leaves so fragile and iridescent against the grey clouds. A bunny hops past into the fields of jonquils. As I ride on my bike with Elka on the back. I imagine myself living here, and I dream about how we can make it possible.</p>\n<p>I particularly love the family we are staying with. When I say family, I mean my sister-in-law and the five friends she lives with. They run a company together that creates art and light and beautiful glass works. They eat together, share all the chores and responsibilities and live&#8230;harmoniously. There is so much warmth in this old Dutch home, with steep, narrow staircases and ornamental marble floors. People kiss each other on the mouth to greet each other. They share the conversation, like a loved animal passed around the table. Despite lack of sleep, Elka has thrived in this beautiful home. She cuddles up with any of the family members, sits on their laps and tells them a story excitedly. She refuses to let me put her in bed because she knows she will miss out. She tells them she loves them. She sings silly songs about them. Within a day, she felt at home.</p>\n<p>We leave here tomorrow for the next instalment &#8211; two weeks in Austria, staying in another communal home, which is the home of Greg&#8217;s father. But after a week, perhaps I will be scheming about moving there instead.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1091\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_0206.jpg\"><img title=\"Walking through the forest\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_0206.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Walking in the forest with &#8220;My Mother&#8221;</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_1092\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_0258.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1092\" title=\"At the zoo\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_0258.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">At Burger&#8217;s Zoo</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_1093\" style=\"width: 210px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_0312.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1093\" title=\"Kunst en Licht\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_0312.jpg?w=200&#038;h=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kunst en Licht</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_1094\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_0326.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1094\" title=\"A little cold and wet\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_0326.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A little cold and wet</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_1095\" style=\"width: 210px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_03351.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1095\" title=\"In Utrecht\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_03351.jpg?w=200&#038;h=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">In Utrecht</p></div>\n", "post_id": 1088, "location": false, "date": "05-09-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Grimmenstein", "love", "family", "travel", "mother's day", "transcontinental", "Austria", "children"], "text": "<p>Last <a href=\"http://heartmama.net/2011/06/04/my-second-mothers-day/\">Mother&#8217;s Day</a>, I wandered happily around the local markets with my little family and a lot of love. This year, I woke on a mattress in an old mill in Austria. My little girl rolled over and kissed me on the lips&#8230;&#8221;Good morning, darling,&#8221; she says, &#8220;I love you. Sleep well?&#8221; So filled with love, it hurts my chest. But when I told her it was Mother&#8217;s Day, she said in a teary voice: &#8220;No, it&#8217;s not Mother&#8217;s Day, it&#8217;s <em>my</em> day.&#8221; This is the lot of a mother, and the will of a child.</p>\n<p>My husband and I then cycled together to a little town called Aspang and celebrated with goulash soup and apelspritz, coffee and cake. Ironically, Mother&#8217;s Day morning was one of the only mornings we have spent without our dear daughter, as we take advantage of six doting family members and Elka&#8217;s love for them.</p>\n<p>This beautiful house where we are staying was once an old mill &#8211; at least 500 years old. It was found as a ruin by my husband&#8217;s family when he was a boy. They have spent every year since doing it up and making it livable. Not only is it livable, it is grand and opulent.</p>\n<p>The bathroom is ten square metres and every inch of wall and floor is a mosaic of precious gems and stones. There is an enormous wooden japanese bath in the centre which fits at least 13 people. (And yes, that has been demonstrated).</p>\n<p>The house is four levels and has ten bedrooms. The walls are covered with paintings. There is a beautiful large antique woodfired stove in the kitchen, which warms the huge space in the winter.</p>\n<p>The house is surrounded by vegetable gardens and more recently, a handmade stables for the five horses, eight (or more) goats and two enormous hairy pigs with teeth. Forty-three rabbits live near by. Seven cats (one a little weak and mild) roam freely across the acreage and through the house. A dear little stream runs beside the house. The village is Grimmenstein, and it is surrounded by mountains, which by Austrian standards are considered hills, but would put up a fight against Mt Kosciusko.</p>\n<p>Seven people live here, including Gregor&#8217;s father and his grandfather, affectionately known as Opa. Opa is 86, and lives his life in one small room of the house. He beams every time we walk through his room. He sings German songs to Elka and kisses me on the mouth three times. He can&#8217;t speak English or Dutch at all, but we understand his affection for us. He loves our little family, and is thrilled to bits that we are here. Gregor and he have always been very close. It is so special for him to meet Elka.</p>\n<p>Of course, it is so special for everyone here to see Gregor and I and meet Elka for the first time. It has been over four years since Gregor last saw his father. There is a lot of emotion&#8230; In many ways, our transcontinental existence is so difficult, with half of our family living in Europe. We simply can&#8217;t afford to come too often, and nor can they to come all the way to Australia. But we manage. And in many ways, it is incredible how familiar everything is, even though we are here so infrequently. Within hours, Elka embraced her family members. She chats to them animatedly, hugs them and sings to them. There are no qualms at all when my husband and I take liberties such as having cake and coffee on our own. Surrounded by such love, Elka doesn&#8217;t mind a fig.</p>\n<p>Happy Mother&#8217;s Day to all the mothers who read my blog.

I could barely breathe from excitement as the plane lifted its wheels and soared into the sky. In a foreign country, I could be a different version of myself. I would transcend from dreary old Life and emerge the other side of the clouds in a land I knew I should have been born, amongst houses that were quaint and cobbled streets that were hundreds of years old. I would breathe in dust that tasted different and allow my senses to be ravaged by new smells, sounds and colours. Travel never let me down. I had moments of grief during my time away, but largely it fulfilled my appetite for novel and wonderful delights.</p>\n<p>And then I had a child.</p>\n<p>This time, prior to my flight, I lay awake worrying about all the things I hadn&#8217;t done, like putting out the garbage or packing my phone charger. The day before we left, my husband and I bickered, which was unusual for us. We snapped where snapping was not due. We were both anxious, and consequently, my daughter clung to me fiercely, needing cuddles all day long, which made last minute packing and cleaning impossible.</p>\n<p>We were blessed with a smooth plane trip and a child that travels amazingly well. She never grumbled, had appropriate amounts of sleep and when the time was right, she entertained our neighbours.</p>\n<p>We battled crooked sleep patterns for the first few days &#8211; even those weren&#8217;t <em>that</em> bad. Though we saw a whole new side of Elka&#8230;fast becoming an independent and assertive toddler under normal conditions, when faced with sleep deprivation, her sense of independence and assertiveness escalated. As did her wild ways. She would screech (excitedly) in train carriages and tear down the platform, sending both her parents into a fit of near anxiety as they struggled to prevent her from flying off the side. She threw food on the floor and developed numerous cheeky ways to entertain herself.</p>\n<p>Once sleep homoeostasis was restored and her wild ways subsided, Elka&#8217;s social personality flourished. She now will chat non-stop for 15 minutes about chimneys, and little men with funny hats and sharks, regardless of who&#8217;s listening. She sings and dances for strangers, even attracting a severe &#8220;Shhhh&#8230;.&#8221; from a cranky French lady in the Belvedere Museum, Vienna. Like both her parents, she is drawn to company and novel experiences, never tiring, and constantly satisfied if surrounded by Happenings, Events and Lots of People.</p>\n<p>Travel is different for me now. Now, I don&#8217;t transcend. I am the same Old Me who walks the footpaths of Panorama Drive pushing a pram. The air here is fresher and cooler. The natural flowers more beautiful. The mountains more astonishing. I appreciate it all&#8230;but I am no longer&#8230;lifted. I felt it particularly at the Belvedere yesterday. After years of studying art history, I used to visit European art galleries and became overwhelmed by passion. Schiele and Klimt would give me goose bumps. Yesterday, walking around the same museum, seeing the same paintings, I was preoccupied with the fact that Elka needed a sleep, or Elka needed a &#8220;Jutie&#8221;, or Elka needed to go outside. My micro-world of me, Elka, Gregor and the growing foetus felt the same in the Belvedere as it did on Panorama Drive.</p>\n<p>I am partly whimsical about my young and carefree travelling self. But still, I enjoy taking my micro-world with me, seeing new things and being in new environments. I will take it to Mt Everest if I have to&#8230;because there is no way I can do without it. Travel is different now&#8230;I can&#8217;t tell you which exhibitions are on in Vienna, but I&#8217;ll happily explain the city park in vivid detail. That is becoming an adult and a parent.</p>\n", "post_id": 1118, "location": false, "date": "05-23-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["family", "group living", "nuclear family", "parenting", "travelling with children", "communal living"], "text": "<p>We return to home turf after one month, and the residue of Europe lingers in our bones, our fridge, our emotions and our sleep patterns. How do you stretch out a holiday so it lasts as long as possible, even when you have made the return journey?</p>\n<p>My holiday lingers in the following:</p>\n<p>* 1 kg\u00a0organic Dutch aged goat&#8217;s cheese<br />\n* Six olde worlde tea cups<br />\n* A bag of second-hand clothes<br />\n* 800 photographs<br />\n* Five hours laying awake in the middle of the night<br />\n* The starter for the best sourdough bread ever made.</p>\n<p>I also carry with me a renewed love of group living. In the first house-hold we stayed in lived six people, and the second house-hold had eight. In principle, I have never objected to group living. It makes a lot of sense, when it works. You need fewer resources between people (environmental and ethical), you always have company, there is a shared sense of working together on a project, there is always someone to wash up, you have endless capacity for conversation&#8230;The trick is, achieving perfect harmony within the group. You are always bound to have personality clashes and power imbalances. How does a group do\u00a0this?</p>\n<p>I realised after a month of living among a group that the keys to communal living include:</p>\n<p>* Respect<br />\n* Co-operation<br />\n* The ability to listen to each other<br />\n* The ability to bend in the wind<br />\n* Love<br />\n* Humour.</p>\n<p>It was wonderful for Elka to be in a large group of people. She always had someone to talk to and play with. At times I would find myself unexpectedly reading a novel, and would look up suddenly, asking &#8220;Where&#8217;s Elka?&#8221;. Rest assured, her sweet voice would float from upstairs or downstairs or from the kitchen as she giggled with and entertained one of her new &#8220;friends&#8221;. The mother&#8217;s load suddenly became lighter. I was there for cuddles following falls, or rescuing Elka from dangerous animals (e.g. bunnies and cats), or putting Elka to sleep at night. The rest of the time, she was happy with anyone. Oh, to live in a village with Aunties and Grandmas and Sisters and Cousins, all sharing in the love and responsibility of a child&#8230;And seeing her personality flourish made me realise how great it is for a child to be among influences other than her parents alone.</p>\n<p>After five years at boarding school and another four in share houses, though, I know I am temperamentally not well suited to group living. My need for absolute harmony is unrealistic. My tolerance of inequality is low. My need to be alone or with a loved one is too high. As much as I love the thought of communal lifestyle, and love to be\u00a0a group member\u00a0for a while, part of me is relieved\u00a0to be home with my little nuclear family, where life is simple and rhythms are familiar. I have my company in the form of a two-year-old and a 6&#8217;5&#8243; man. We tarry along. \u00a0Familiar, loving, close.</p>\n<p>The cheese will not last more than \u00a0a couple of days. I am hoping the teacups don&#8217;t break and the photographs last forever. I can only hold onto my European holiday for so long until the residue seeps into the rest of my ordinary, everyday life.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/img_0202.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1132\" title=\"Hairdressing\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/img_0202.jpg?w=480&#038;h=320\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"320\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/img_0969.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1131\" title=\"Aunty Sascha\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/img_0969.jpg?w=480&#038;h=320\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"320\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/img_0854.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1129\" title=\"Playing with friends\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/img_0854.jpg?w=480&#038;h=320\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"320\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/img_0800.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1128\" title=\"Tour of Vienna\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/img_0800.jpg?w=480&#038;h=320\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"320\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/img_0961.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1130\" title=\"Opa\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/img_0961.jpg?w=480&#038;h=320\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"320\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 1124, "location": false, "date": "06-06-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["little friends", "two", "parenting", "mouse poo", "child care", "two-year-olds", "friends"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/img_1045.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image aligncenter\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/img_1045.jpg?w=487\" alt=\"Image\" /></a></p>\n<p>Today I went to war with mouse poo. One little mouse took liberties in our house and pooed on the window sill, in the cutlery drawer, the utensil drawer, on every kitchen surface and through the\u00a0Tupperware\u00a0cupboard. One little mouse. One ridiculous amount of poo. Not only that, but last night, in bed, I could hear the little bugger scurrying around. I had left my daughter&#8217;s &#8220;jutie&#8221; bottle beside our bed, so she would have it in the morning. But the sneaky wretch had bitten through the teat and drunk the entire contents. Not overly worried about spiders and critters, I had let this mouse get away with too much. Now, after a day of cleaning poo, washing out every cupboard and every surface, I despise mice &#8211; and yes, finally succumbed to putting out mouse bait.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, being at home, cleaning, was a blessing today. I looked after Elka&#8217;s bestie, &#8220;my friend called A.&#8221; It was a privilege to do my house chores and listen to the ramble of two-year-olds playing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>&#8220;You want this one?&#8221;<br />&#8220;You can have this one.&#8221;<br />&#8220;Which one you want?&#8221; <br />&#8220;Thank you! [inflection on the end]&#8220;<br />&#8220;What you doing?&#8221;<br />&#8220;What <em>you\u00a0</em>doing?&#8221;<br />&#8220;Oh no! You spilt yogurt on your jumper! Oh no!&#8221;</p>\n<p>And so on.</p>\n<p>We tootled around the house, and when the sun came out, we trundled through the garden. I did my chores, while they played beside me. I had two little friends. We stopped for lunch and ate together at the kitchen table. Joni Mitchell was singing <em>From Both Sides Now</em> on the radio and we three sang along, with hand movements.</p>\n<p>As my husband and I discussed this evening, looking after a friend&#8217;s child is a perfect alternative to child care and babysitting. We know each other&#8217;s parenting styles and trust one another. The children are very familiar and love each other. I got to read a magazine for the first time ever while they entertained themselves,\u00a0<em>and\u00a0</em>my house has never looked cleaner (despite the mouse poo). No-one pays a cent.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To end a perfect home day, we lit the pot belly. Nothing beats a warm fire while a storm breaks outside and night falls.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Plop. The mouse just fell from the kitchen bench. I believe its pooing days are over.

Blog Facebook pages that started around the time that I did have several thousand followers &#8211; I have 121, and have had for a long time. My readership has increased slightly over the past year, which is exciting&#8230;but I wonder what one does to get\u00a0<em>so\u00a0</em>many readers and so many comments. Am I just not cool enough?</p>\n<p>Blogging has turned the average mama who can write into a celebrity. Imagine being someone who thousands of people listen to every day? Gone are the days when Hollywood was the only platform for stardom. Now Joanna Blo can be a star from her living room, wearing her pyjamas, sipping her hot chocolate while baby sleeps in the cot. No-one cares what she looks like, what she studied, or how much she works. It&#8217;s like reality TV stardom.</p>\n<p>When I was at school, having friends meant everything to me.

These friendships were genuine connections; people I felt akin to despite which group they were from. Comparing my blog to other blogs reminds me of those early high school days, when I admired the cool girls, but felt disconnected from them; when I had close friendships that weren&#8217;t defined by a group, but by a genuine connection.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll be impressed if my blog ever &#8220;makes it&#8221; and I become a living room celebrity, wearing my pyjamas.

Yep, she&#8217;s funny and a great writer. This week she posted <a href=\"http://www.edenriley.com/2012/06/who-hell-are-you.html\">&#8220;Who the hell are you?&#8221;</a>, and has invited other bloggers to face the challenge. Who the hell are you, anyway?</p>\n<p>Given that blogging is already one of my more egocentric outlets &#8211; a public diary about me and my life &#8211; I may &nbsp;as well indulge.</p>\n<p>Like anyone else, I can&#8217;t really answer the question, &#8220;So, who am I, really?&#8221;. It&#8217;s far too complex. I was recently told that I was an archetypal Queen. I will take that as a compliment. When I was 13, a so-called friend told me I was austere and a bit <em>stiff</em> &#8211; like cardboard. At the time, I took that one, but now I reject it, thank you very much &#8211; I belly dance to a belly dance DVD in my living room. At university, another so-called friend described me as librarian during the day, Cat Woman at night. I wasn&#8217;t sure, and am still not sure, if that was complimentary. But these are the things I have been told.</p>\n<p>What I know, or at least think of myself, is that I am a people person. I freak out if I am to be alone for one day. I need entertainment. I need to be part of things. I need to know what&#8217;s going on. I hate being left out. I am genuinely interested in other people, and other stories. I believe this will make me a good counsellor. I am also relatively non-judgemental. You can tell me your crazy story and it&#8217;s unlikely I&#8217;ll be shocked. Anyone can be my friend, as long as they are nice to me.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s important for me that you like me. Very important. I hate to disappoint and the worst thing in the world is if you are angry with me. This is&nbsp;why I have avoided politics, discussions about vaccination and refrain from criticising people in my blog. I don&#8217;t want to upset anyone, although I know this is an impossible expectation. I wanted to die when I was a boarder at a girl&#8217;s school in Year 9, and a fellow student overheard me bitching about her on the phone. That fact that I had hurt her and she was mad at me was unbearable. I really want to be your friend, and I want a genuine connection.</p>\n<p>I want to do well at things. I was a high achiever academically and now fuss over making the perfect cup of coffee.</p>\n<p>I get stressed easily. I hate criticism. I want to feel appreciated by my parents.</p>\n<p>Until I met my husband, I sucked at relationships. My longest was 10 months, and 6 months of it were hell. I never understood why I couldn&#8217;t find a nice boyfriend, then when I found a boyfriend, it became an impossible situation, and I stayed in an abusive relationship way too long. Six months later, I met the man who very soon after would be my husband. It was the first time I trusted my intuition, and to be honest, the first time I met a guy who could appreciate me as I am. He seems to understand me better than anyone and accept everything about me, except my cranky pants. Maybe he should be writing this.</p>\n<p>I love family life. These last two years after my daughter was born have been the happiest two years of my life. Motherhood suits me. I find it easy, relaxing. Motherhood makes me more loving and I believe the best thing you can do in your life is be a kind and loving person. I think I am a kind mother, and I see it in my daughter. She is happy. She is social. She is very well-adjusted. I think being her mother is the best thing I have ever done.</p>\n<p>I believe in inoculation, climate change and natural birth. I am vaguely political. I definitely vote <a title=\"The Greens\" href=\"http://greens.org.au/\">Green</a>, and want conservative change. I want the world to be a better place. I don&#8217;t read the news &#8211; it&#8217;s too infuriating. I am mad that there are a handful of wealthy people with too much power and influence and billions of people suffering.</p>\n<p>I live a privileged life and don&#8217;t want for anything, except lace-up ankle boots. I believe that everyone suffers to some extent, even the wealthiest and the most privileged. Even the seemingly happiest. I believe we should learn to dance in the rain.</p>\n<p>I wish more people read my blog &#8211; I don&#8217;t know what to do to become a better blogger and have a wider readership. But in other ways my blog &#8211; my personal diary &#8211; gives me great satisfaction and is the perfect place to stop and collect my thoughts. I am grateful to all the beautiful people who read&nbsp;<em>Heart Mama&nbsp;</em>and have the generosity to let me know how they feel about it.</p>\n<p>I love cheese. I am 23 weeks pregnant. I am 179cm tall.</p>\n<p><em>So tell me a little about yourself. Who are you? I promise I am interested.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "post_id": 1180, "location": false, "date": "06-10-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["world's best sourdough recipe", "organic", "healthy", "sour dough", "bread-making", "home baking", "natural parenting", "home-made", "sourdough"], "text": "<p>No mess.<br />\nEasy.<br />\nLow salt.<br />\nLow sugar.<br />\nDelicious goodness.</p>\n<p>This recipe is care of my sister-in-law, Sascha.

The key is to keep it dry so it doesn&#8217;t mould. If you aren&#8217;t using it regularly, check from time to time and add flour if necessary.</p>\n<p>For one large loaf that lasts our little family four to five days, I use about 1 cup of starter. Distil water by boiling and let it cool. Add about 1/2 litre of distilled water. Add generous portions of seeds. I use pumpkin seeds, linseed, sunflower seeds and about 1 teaspoon of fennel seed and one teaspoon of cumin. You can use any seeds you like. Also add about 1 cup of flour &#8211; any flour you prefer. I use half-half organic unbleached white and<a href=\"http://www.goodness.com.au/store/p1051/Organic-Khorasan-Flour-Unbleached-White-5KG/product_info.html\"> khorasan wholemea</a>l flour.

I add 2 teaspoons of salt with hot water to cous cous, but you could instead add salt directly to mixture. When cooled, mix cous cous through the sourdough batter. Very gradually, mix in flour. In all, I add about 2 cups, but you want to add it gradually and mix in, because the idea of this recipe is to keep it quite moist. When the dough is starting to form a shape, ditch the fork or spoon and sprinkle a layer of flour on top of dough, and begin to work the flour around the dough.

I heard an interesting conversation with psychologist Dr Larry Rosen on <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/allinthemind/\">All in the Mind, Radio National</a> this morning. (Stay At Home Mum Geek, I know). The gist of an<a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/allinthemind/i-disorder---the-psychology-of-technology/4071112\"> iDisorder</a> is that our brains are being negatively impacted by the excessive use of technology and social media. Signs and symptoms of an iDisorder include:</p>\n<p>* Reaching for your smartphone every five to ten minutes even though you know it will vibrate when you receive a new email or message<br />\n* Spending more than two hours at a time on the computer<br />\n* Checking Facebook repeatedly throughout the day for new status updates of people you don&#8217;t know personally.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/allinthemind/i-disorder---the-psychology-of-technology/4071112\">Rosen</a> was saying that people are tending towards technology related anxiety. Brain imaging shows that our brains are hyper-active when using certain technologies and behaviours have anxious qualities. Brain-imaging shows that our brains are much more active when using Google than when reading a novel (maybe this is a good thing). When using<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/\"> Facebook</a>, brain-imaging shows that <a href=\"http://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/dopamine\">dopamine</a> is released in the brain. Dopamine is a pleasure and reward neurotransmitter. It is also released in the brain during additive behaviours like drinking, smoking and taking drugs. Dopamine release gives our brains a positive message, so we continue with the addictive behaviour.</p>\n<p>I always felt that Facebook, particularly, was addictive. I find myself checking for status updates of people I barely know throughout the day. Particularly when I use the computer at night, I feel hyper-active. The world of blogs, status updates and images whirs through my brain, and I lie awake, stimulated. Although it is mild and doesn&#8217;t inhibit my life, my addiction has definitely germinated. All that holds it back is a lousy Internet (Optus Wireless) connection.</p>\n<p>Rosen recommended strategies for minimising anxiety and other iDisorders when using technology. Strategies like stepping away from the computer every two hours to reset the brain with an activity like going for a walk, interacting with a &#8216;real&#8217; person or simply gazing out to window to day dream. He also suggested pausing before you post a status update or an email. Write it, then step away and reflect for ten minutes. Come back and reread your message. Does it say what you want it to say? Does it portray the You you want to portray?</p>\n<p>Is this the life of a Stay At Home Mum? Reaching for her smartphone a thousand times a day&#8230; Checking Facebook status updates all through the day, desperate not to miss a beat&#8230;Photographing every move her child makes using an iPhone and doing something funky with the photo using <a href=\"http://instagr.am/\">Instagram</a>&#8230;<a href=\"http://pinterest.com/\">Pinning</a> morning, noon and night?</p>\n<p>I must admit that technology certainly improves the stay-at-home life. Once hard-working, socially engaged intellectuals, us Stay At Homes stimulate our brains between nappy changes. We grasp at social networking groups and pages aimed at mothers &#8211; places we can share anonymously the woes of motherhood and dirty dishes. We blog. We forum. We pin. Technology is a launch pad for millions of home-run businesses keeping pockets full and creative juices flowing.</p>\n<p>Rosen warns that we are at a precipice &#8211; we need to stop and become conscious of the influence technology has over our lives, behaviours and brain activity, while appreciating all that technology has to offer. Otherwise, as a society, iDisorders will consume us and determine us.</p>\n<p>What do you reckon? Does technology improve life? Do you feel you are at the precipice of an iDisorder? Do you need to implement strategies to maintain psychology health? How does technology make you feel? Are you an iMum?</p>\n", "post_id": 1199, "location": false, "date": "06-18-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["nursery rhymes", "singing", "song"], "text": "<p>The latest thing from Elka is the Row Row Row your Boat medley.

While walking to a friend&#8217;s place this afternoon, she entertained herself the whole way with this little gem. It&#8217;s a medley of all her favourite nursery rhymes, or maybe just the ones she remembers, and is accompanied by very convincing hand gestures. Of course being the parents we are, when her demanding little hands outstretch for a &#8220;Row row row&#8221; and a &#8220;ringaringa&#8221;, we\u00a0obediently\u00a0oblige, and partake in the singing/gesturing fiasco until she tires of it.</p>\n<p>Singing has always been a big part of Elka&#8217;s life. From the third day she was born, and she opened her little throat to scream mightily, I clutched her to my chest desperately wondering what the hell I was going to do. I bopped, I walked, I rocked. Eventually I sat on a gym ball and bounced and sang the nicest song I have ever sung, which was composed from my mother&#8217;s heart and sung in the sweetest voice, never to be recalled again. She paused from her screaming, and then rested into my chest, and eventually fell asleep. We had found our solution to everything.</p>\n<p>Greg would pace down corridors in the late hours of the night, hugging that screaming bundle to his big chest, singing Dutch nursery rhymes, or chanting Buddhist chants until the screaming bundle could scream no more. I would rock her steadily, whilst singing Leonard Cohen&#8217;s\u00a0<em>Hallelujah</em>\u00a0repeatedly. This remains my default song that arises when a song is in need. I know it better than how to breathe.</p>\n<p>We sung in the car. On every trip. Every trip inevitably descended into crying and screaming, and so together Greg and I would pump out one nursery rhyme after ballad until our throats ached or Elka fell asleep. This is where Granny Annie came in&#8230;she spent a good part of her month in Australia introducing Elka to many Dutch songs, and keeping her entertained with her sweet voice in the car.</p>\n<p>At some point (after 14 months), Mum discovered you could play nursery rhymes on the CD player, and they in fact had the same effect as the singing. Actually they were better. We have never travelled without a nursery rhyme CD since.</p>\n<p>And the rest of the time, Greg and I are making up silly ditties for Elka (usually about Elka), so I guess it is no surprise she is quite rapt with her own little nursery rhyme medley, now that she can say a few words. I suspect there will always be a little song in Elka&#8217;s head, and it will probably be\u00a0<em>Hallelujah</em>.</p>\n", "post_id": 120, "location": false, "date": "06-18-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["childcare", "children"], "text": "<p>There comes a day in every baby&#8217;s life when they have to pack their little spotted kerchief, sling it over their shoulder, and venture out \u00a0into the big wide world&#8230;and today was Elki&#8217;s day.

And besides, it would only be for a couple of hours.</p>\n<p>So I checked out the occasional child care in Lismore on Friday with Elka. Elka had fun exploring and the ladies seemed very nice. It was a very friendly atmosphere. So this morning, breath abated, I dropped her off. I said good bye, she didn&#8217;t cry, just gave me one of her big wet kisses on the mouth, and off I went. I wasn&#8217;t gone long, so it was a good starting point. When I arrived back, even though she had missed her regular sleep time, she was very happy. The ladies said she was great the whole time, playing with the dollies, in the sandpit and reading books (no surprise there).</p>\n<p>Big sigh of relief.</p>\n<p>I had not thought I would be using child care so early. Although it means we are completely poor, I have chosen to be a stay at home mum, and I think I would miss Elka if she went away for the day. Also, I have heard the odd psycho tale about child care, for example, a lady on <a title=\"Nifty Mums Network\" href=\"http://www.niftymumsnetwork.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Nifty Mums Network</a> shared that her child had been pinched by the carer and told to F*@king go to sleep&#8230;which is far from the nurturing parenting we aspire to&#8230;so I suppose I was a little apprehensive. But as it is, I have found a great option for us&#8230;Elka can go play for a few hours a week with other kids and new toys while I get stuff done, and it is very cheap and cheerful.

Elka was drinking from her bottle, wearing a sweet little red and white polka-dot hat. &#8220;What you doing, Mama?&#8221; she asked, as she does a thousand times a day.

She sobbed, and stroked my face. Between blubbers she asked, &#8220;Are you OK Mama? What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221; I will never forgive myself, I thought. She is so pure. So innocent and kind.</p>\n<p>This was me getting frustrated and resorting to physical harm. If you know me personally, you will know this is against everything I believe in and preach about.

How could I verbally protect the rights of children in mini speeches to friends and turn around and push my child away? How would I face the contradiction?</p>\n<p>The point of writing it down is to uncover my shame, and discuss a topic I feel very strongly about.</p>\n<p>Last year, I was shocked to read an article that <a href=\"http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/national/australian-parents-do-smack-their-children/story-e6freuzr-1226134667946\">85% of people polled in Australia admit to hitting their child and only 8% regret i</a>t. Really? Are we so stuck in the past? Caning children at school has long been unacceptable. In other developed countries, smacking children is illegal. In Australia, it is illegal to assault another adult, but it is not illegal to smack a child. The\u00a0discrepancy between harming an adult and a child\u00a0is actually stipulated. How can this be?</p>\n<p>Author <a href=\"http://kerrisackville.com/\">Kerri Sackville</a> was on Sunrise soon after this article came out. She was saying there was a difference between lightly tapping a child&#8217;s bottom to help stop them spinning out &#8211; in fact, sometimes it&#8217;s the only way &#8211; and whacking a child. Her role was to advocate the rights of parents who choose to hit their children. The Sunrise crew made a little joke about the fact that little old New Zealand actually have a law against hitting children &#8211; they failed to mention that most European countries have the same legal standards as New Zealand.</p>\n<p>If I had any doubt about the public view Kerri and the Sunrise team were representing, my fears were confirmed at a local playgroup. Three women stood around chatting about mothering tactics (as you do at playgroup). One very large woman wearing high-heeled black patent boots proudly announced to the circle that her three-year-old had recently learnt the meaning of &#8220;One, two, three, smack&#8230;&#8221; Apparently, the second time &#8220;One, two, three&#8230;&#8221; began, the dear little boy fled to tidy his room before the &#8220;smack&#8221;. Discipline by fear? I guess it&#8217;s one way of parenting, and sadly in Australia it is the normal, accepted way of disciplining children.</p>\n<p>As usual, I agree with <a href=\"http://www.pinky-mychild.com/\">Pinky McKay</a>\u00a0on the matter. In <a href=\"http://www.pinky-mychild.com/toddler/toddler-tactics-by-pinky-mckay\"><em>Toddler Tactics</em></a>, Pinky writes:</p>\n<p><em>According to other studies into the effects of physical punishment, although children may comply in the short term, they do not learn the desired behaviour (remember, discipline means &#8216;to teach&#8217;). It is highly likely that as your children push the boundaries further, you&#8217;ll find yourself hitting harder as your frustration levels escalate. There is also increased evidence to suggest that physical punishment may be linked with more aggressive or antisocial behaviour, emotional damage and diminished cognitive ability. In review of several longitudinal studies published in\u00a0</em>the Psychologist<em> in 2002, psychologist Dr Penelope Leach found smacking related to a five-fold increase in toddler non-compliance; a four-fold increase in assaults on siblings by children under ten; double the rate of physical aggression in school playgrounds among six-year-olds; and an increased likelihood if substance abuse and criminal activity in adolescence. (McKay, P. 2008. Toddler Tactics. p. 63).</em></p>\n<p>Once upon a time, it was acceptable for teachers to cane children in school. It was also acceptable for husbands to occasionally hit their wives if they stepped out of line. Thankfully, neither of these things are accepted in Australian contemporary society so I live in hope that our feelings about smacking children as discipline will also change.</p>\n<p>After Kerri&#8217;s Sunrise interview, I wrote on her Facebook page that I was saddened by the views she expressed. In my mind, she was waving the green flag for hitting kids and indirectly condoning child abuse. No parent is perfect, and perhaps, like me, we will\u00a0succumb\u00a0to frustration and\u00a0irritation\u00a0and do something we will regret. The point is though that social conscience needs to change to see smacking children as unacceptable. It has happened in other countries &#8211; in The Netherlands, for example, where my husband is from, smacking children is frowned upon. It is not something you would boast about at playgroup. If the bar is raised, then at least we have an ethical standard to aspire to. Occasionally, as humans we will slip and make a mistake, but my hope is that we will at least strive to look after and protect our children. Nurture their tender souls. Do as nature intended.</p>\n<p>My toddler has had some challenging behaviours lately, like deliberately peeing on the floor, or on her car seat while we drive. I could get angry, and scream and shout and possibly hit her in an attempt to teach her a lesson. But I know there is no point. All I am teaching her by acting in this manner is that it is OK to scream and shout and hit. Kids learn by example. If we are kind and soft, they will follow us. If we say please and thank you, so will they. If we are frustrated and anxious, they will mimic our behaviour. Although I get frustrated and want to scream and shout, I bite my tongue and think about what will actually be effective, which is to stay calm, and explain to her that it is not OK to pee haphazardly and with intention. In toddler-eeze: Pees go on the toilet, otherwise Mummy has to do more laundry, and floor mopping.</p>\n<p>The passionfruit vine incident is a good lesson for me. The pain the event caused me is etched so deeply into my skin that, although I will try, I can&#8217;t forget it. It is a reminder that I am capable of frustration and violence towards a child, as much as it pains me to say so. When the moment heats up, I need to cool down, and reflect on what is good for my child, and good for the situation. Violence is not the answer, ever.</p>\n<p><strong><em>I have recently moved my blog to\u00a0<a href=\"http://mylittlesunshinehouse.com\">My Little Sunshine House</a>.

Definitely before my husband.</p>\n<p>The revelation came as I opened up my computer to squeeze in an hour&#8217;s work before the toddler woke. Here it is&#8230;a new direction for\u00a0<em>Heart Mama</em>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em>Heart Mama<br />\n</em><em>Kind and gentle parenting.<br />\n</em><em>Happy children, happy parents, a better world.<br />\n</em><em>A blog that reaches into the heart of parenting to find better ways to parent.</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">It&#8217;s certainly a work in progress, but basically, I found the channel for my blog I have been looking for. <em>Heart Mama</em>\u00a0began as stories, catharsis and occasionally break downs.

The ones that work well are blogs with a very clear voice and a clear agenda. If I can do anything in this world, I want to advocate and celebrate gentle and kind parenting styles through my writing. I want children to live happier lives. I want parents to feel more relaxed. I want parents to have more time for their children. I want the world to be a better place, and I believe that as parents we have such a powerful role in how we shape our children&#8217;s personalities, states of mind and behaviours. We might not be able to single-handedly rid the world of poverty, climate change or greedy\u00a0bigots. What we can do is nurture a positive influence in the home, and sow the seeds of love, peace and happiness. I want my blog to represent this movement, and stimulate kind and gentle parenting through words and personal experiences.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I hope you will be behind me on this journey.

We got to talking about our children and their little ways. He mentioned his son was transitioning from nappies to undies&#8230;I asked him how it went, as I knew there had been some resistance. He said that his boy protested fiercely for some time. Later that day, he went to the toilet with his mother&#8217;s help &#8211; she soothed him and listened to his fears, and he went. When he realised what he had done, he felt proud. He felt empowered. When his daddy came home, he excitedly shared the news. \u00a0He&#8217;s had a couple of &#8216;accidents&#8217; since, but his parents are OK with it. They don&#8217;t get frustrated or upset with him. They don&#8217;t expect him to be perfect. They&#8217;re allowing him to build his own awareness and confidence, so he doesn&#8217;t feel fear about being nappy-free. The little boy hasn&#8217;t looked back. He doesn&#8217;t ask for nappies. He&#8217;s enjoying his new freedom, independence and being a member of the Family Toilet Users Club.</p>\n<p>I thought this was a really beautiful example of giving a child the space and time they need to feel and express themselves; of giving a child the opportunity to pass through a difficult experience.</p>\n<p>We experienced something similar ourselves with Elka the other night. She had been very clingy for a couple of days, falling down in dramatic displays of emotion if the tiniest thing didn&#8217;t go her way. She was fixated on issues like needing her &#8220;froggy&#8221; bib, or having to watch another episode of Playschool, or her naughty parents getting the\u00a0<em>wrong</em> dolly&#8230; there wasn&#8217;t much rhyme or reason to the madness. It was about everything and nothing. The poor little chicken obviously wasn&#8217;t feeling herself.</p>\n<p>We had talked about going out to the <a href=\"http://www.lanternparade.com/\">lantern parade</a>, and she had been looking forward to it all day. When the time came to leave, she collapsed in a heap, howling. She didn&#8217;t want a hug, a kiss, a jutie&#8230;she just needed to cry, she told us. We were keen to leave so we didn&#8217;t miss the parade, but realised there was no point pushing her. Gregor held her and I sat on the floor in front of her and she wept and screamed. Suddenly, it was over. Like a storm, it passed and there was calm.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m ready to go now,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>As I said to my friend at the cafe, we are fortunate to have the time to give children the space they need to express and explore their emotions in a contained, safe environment. People who are always working and busy with other activities, who live on tight schedules and deadlines and who don&#8217;t get enough support must struggle to find that space. I know for myself when I have a lot of work to do, my priorities switch around. I am determined to get done what I need to do, rather than just sitting quietly for a moment to give my daughter her space to feel. But when we make a decision, we can make a slot in our busy schedules to give children what they need emotionally.</p>\n<p>A similar message came up when I was seeing a psychologist a few years ago. We were talking about dealing with stress and difficult emotions. Her advice, which was essentially<a href=\"http://mindfulness.org.au/\"> mindfulness</a>, was to give the difficult feeling air. To allow it to be there. To acknowledge it. Give it a name. Identify its characteristics &#8211; Where is it in the body? Is it warm or cold? What is its colour? I really responded to this, and use this technique in so many situations. I used it when I was wincing from searing pain caused by breastfeeding for the first time. Or when I had to sit for several hours in the middle of the night feeding, forcing myself to stay awake by listening to music. Or when Elka has a tantrum and nothing seems to work. I acknowledge the pain this experience is causing me. I let it be there. It passes.</p>\n<p>Giving children that space is demonstrating to them that it is OK feel like this, and that this feeling will change. It is not forcing or pulling. It is simply accepting and allowing. More Relaxed Me. Happier Elka.</p>\n", "post_id": 1297, "location": false, "date": "06-28-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["breastfeeding", "weaning", "children"], "text": "<p>Elka loves to breastfeed, and up until recently, I have been happy to partake. From the moment she was born, she suckled vigorously. At first I was on one-hour-every-three-hour schedule, then I fed on demand, which was a lot of the time.</p>\n<p>Where we live, breastfeeding is celebrated. You see three or four year olds feeding at the market, women push their trolleys in the supermarket whilst feeding, every cafe has a breastfeeding mother. If you had a thing against it, you would probably be in the minority if you live near Lismore.</p>\n<p>The first time I felt self conscious about feeding was when I went down to Melbourne. Most people I knew \u00a0had weaned at 12 months, and a number of people asked me until when I was planning to breastfeed. Up until that point, I hadn&#8217;t really made a plan. I figured I would just let things happen until my milk changed, or Elka got fed up, or I got fed up. But sitting on a tram, surrounded by men and women from different cultures, I suddenly felt very exposed, and somehow incorrect. How was Elka to know that Mummy was not comfortable breastfeeding in this particular context? She chucked a wobbly.</p>\n<p>In the last month or so, I definitely got fed up with night feeds. You can see my earlier <a title=\"Sleeping through the night\" href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.com/2011/06/04/sleeping-through-the-night/\">post</a> about that. So I made my first plan since I had Elka. When uni break commenced, I would stop night feeds. Others had done it, so I knew it was possible. But I fed as normal during the day, so Elka had some continuity.</p>\n<p>About a week later, I was fed up with day feeds too. Sometimes I felt like all the good I was to Elka was being a pair of boobs. And she was so damn insistent. We were on our way to a BBQ with my friend <a title=\"Life of Maddie Baddie\" href=\"http://lifeofmaddiebaddie.wordpress.com\">Maddy</a>\u00a0and I said to Greg, I said: &#8220;How am I ever going to wean Elka?&#8221; and Greg said: &#8220;Zanni, you are an excellent mother, but one area that could be improved is your ability to say no. I for instance don&#8217;t let her have the mobile phone, but you allow her to play with it, just because she makes a fuss if you don&#8217;t.&#8221; Elka, sitting in the back seat, must have had those little earlets tuned in, because the very next day I simply said, &#8220;No, Elki, let&#8217;s do something else&#8221;, and every association she had previously had with feeding broke, one by one, until, two days later, she didn&#8217;t ask at all. There was no fuss, no crying. I was amazed. It was so easy. And now, she wakes up in the morning and asks for an &#8220;uppa&#8221;, which means cuddle, and it is so terribly cute, and definitely something I will never get fed up with.</p>\n<p>I still feed her to sleep at night&#8230;she is very attached to that one, and frankly, I don&#8217;t mind it at all. It&#8217;s a little moment to lie down in the dark with my angel, and let the day roll away behind us.</p>\n", "post_id": 130, "location": false, "date": "06-22-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["art", "imperfect", "parenting", "gentle parenting", "the art of parenting", "love", "perfect imperfection", "children"], "text": "<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/zanni-arnot-12.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-1303\" title=\"zanni-arnot-12\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/zanni-arnot-12.jpg?w=336&#038;h=208\" alt=\"\" width=\"336\" height=\"208\" /></a></p>\n<p>Year 12. Girl&#8217;s boarding school. Recess.</p>\n<p>I am crouched over my visual arts diary in the art room. A couple of other students mill around, dabbing colours; papier-mache sculptures of busts. There are flecks of paint and scratches from scalpels on the table surfaces. This is my refuge.</p>\n<p>My visual arts diary became my life source during that year. It was my place to weep, express, feel and reason. I worked out the world through those pages. Our beautiful teacher, who made a great impression on me, used to tell us we needed to find our philosophy through making art. Page by page, I found something deeper than I already knew.</p>\n<p>I was making an artwork, which was called (cringe)\u00a0<em>Mother Earth Incarnate</em>. It was ink spilt onto unstretched, unprimed canvas. The ink seeped into the texture of the fabric and the colours seeped into each other. I used paint to work into the trails made by the ink. Blemishes and accidents became part of a whole. The painting was a metaphorical map of my grandmother, my mother and my own relationship to our homes and our land. More important to me, though, was the process of working into the painting. It had no preconceived structure or intention. I didn&#8217;t know its form. It sounds very wanky, but the painting was creating itself. It was nature. Perfection. Perfect imperfection.</p>\n<p>(Incidentally, this painting is my major claim to fame, as it hung for a few weeks in the <a href=\"http://qagoma.qld.gov.au/\">Queensland Art Gallery</a> as part of the Minister of Art&#8217;s Awards.)</p>\n<p>Twelve years later (my god, has it really been that long?) I am living Perfect Imperfection every day. Parenting is so\u00a0uncharted. There is no map. No guide. No compass. You can pick up books if you want some ground to stand on. You can join forums. Read blogs. But really, your journey is your own. Your child will be who they are. And the combination of you, your child and anyone else in the family will be a whole other organism.</p>\n<p>Listening to the amazing Karl Kruszelnicki (Dr Karl, AM, scientist) speak with Richard Fidler this morning on <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/conversations/\">Conversations</a> about the ridiculously tiny probability that there is life on earth, or that you or I came to be in existence, I realised how profound and incredible nature really is. We are all so unique. As a planet, we are unique in a universe of billions of planets. Who we are as parents and who our children are is so incidental. And yet it is perfect.</p>\n<p>My daughter may not always comply with my expectations. Some days I might look in the mirror and hate the person I see because of something I said or something I did. But like my Year 12 painting, the blemishes and the drips and the random dot in the corner become part of something beautiful. Accidents can be worked into with oil paint, smudged and created into something new. Or their imperfection can just be, in all their beauty.</p>\n<p>I was inspired to write this post after discovering my new favourite blog\u00a0<em><a href=\"http://www.handsfreemama.com\">Hands Free Mama</a>\u00a0</em>who writes about <a href=\"http://www.handsfreemama.com/2011/01/06/perfect-imperfection/#comment-5111\">Perfect Imperfection</a>.

I promise there is a point.</p>\n<p>Although I\u00a0have cantered around the occasional equestrian ring,\u00a0I don&#8217;t know a lot about horse-riding and training horses. \u00a0Apparently you can learn how to train a horse on-line.\u00a0The following are snippets taken from eHow&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.ehow.com/how_2054196_break-horse.html\">&#8220;How To Break a Horse&#8221;.</a></p>\n<blockquote><p><em>&#8230;Carry your halter and lead beside your leg and slowly approach the horse&#8230;Slowly put the lead around his neck so he can&#8217;t get away.</em></p>\n<p><em>Take the lead with your left hand. Hold just below the snap with the right hand&#8230;This forces him to move when you pull his head around. Your goal is to get him to move his feet when you ask&#8230;</em></p>\n<p><em>Put a bridle on your horse. Slide it onto his face, just like you do the halter. If you are using a bit, you can encourage him to open his mouth and accept it by putting your finger in the very corner of his mouth. There are not teeth here so you can&#8217;t get bitten, but this will make him open his mouth&#8230;</em></p>\n<p><em>Ride your horse as often as possible. This is the only way for him to learn things correctly&#8230;</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>I have obviously edited this for dramatic effect, but the gist is essential &#8211; to break a horse&#8230;well, the name implies it all. To break a horse is to break his spirit so he will be at your command and learn to follow instructions.</p>\n<p>Reprimanded for not saying please or thank you, for snatching a toy from another child, for talking in a loud voice in public, for walking new pink suede shoes through the mud, kids are continually restrained and their little spirits broken. I notice myself throwing a hissy fit about something material and silly and two-year-old Elka can&#8217;t understand what I&#8217;m on about. In her world, broken egg cups aren&#8217;t a big deal, nor are muddy shoes. The Big Deal is whether she gets enough hugs in a day, or whether her slightly hopeless mother forgets to give her lunch, or whether her silly parents understand what the hell she is asking for. These are the things that matter.</p>\n<p>Gregor and I have an unspoken agreement not to reprimand Elka for banalities, or to worry about things like manners. Consequently, when I do yell because I break a plate or walk into a cupboard, other than being concerned for my well-being, Elka doesn&#8217;t react to my raised voice. She doesn&#8217;t have an emotional connection to it. When I yell, Elka just thinks Mum&#8217;s gone crazy.</p>\n<p>I appreciate that here, in these parts, spirited children are welcome. We don&#8217;t arch our eyebrows when a kid is &#8216;naughty&#8217; or &#8216;noisy&#8217;. A kid is just a kid, and it&#8217;s beautiful to watch their spirit unleash. These spirited kids aren&#8217;t out-of-control or without discipline. They know the rights and wrongs of life. To the contrary of being unruly, these kids are very sweet with one another, respectful towards adults, say please and thank you and are affectionate. They just have muddy shoes.</p>\n", "post_id": 1336, "location": false, "date": "07-16-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["friends", "children", "babies", "mums group"], "text": "<p>Basking in an unusual case of warm sunshine yesterday in my garden with five mothers and their gorgeous babies, I felt so fortunate.</p>\n<p>When I moved to Northern NSW from Melbourne nearly two years ago, I left behind an amazing group of friends (when I say left behind, it is purely in the physical sense; emotionally and cyberly we are still connected). Although I was so excited to move to beaches and warmer weather, my fear was making friends again. How do adults make friends? At uni and college it is so easy, but now with no job, and no college, how would I ever make any serious connections? Though everyone assured me that when I have a child I would have an instantaneous group of friends.</p>\n<p>In fact, it happened before I had the child. I was planning to birth at the Natural Birth Centre outside Lismore &#8211; a beautiful place on a property, which supported a home-style birth in a safe environment under obstetrics care. We had ante natal classes there, and there were two other wonderful couples in that group &#8211; our first friends in the area. Soon, I met another couple, who gave birth a month before I did. We had so much in common, and they were just such warm, generous and fun people. Still very good friends. When Elka was born, I came back to the birth centre every Thursday for mums and bubs. Sometimes it was just me and another girl, and gradually the group expanded. Women came religiously. And to continue in a religious vein, it saved us. Women of all different ages, and from all over the north coast, whose only commonality was that we aspired to have a natural birth bonded beautifully. The birth centre has since, sadly, closed down, but we still continue to meet.</p>\n<p>The group has since expanded&#8230;someone will meet a mum who doesn&#8217;t have a mums group, and we welcome her to ours. The destination changes, but the connections are still as vital.</p>\n<p>So it was appropriate that yesterday we also launched our website, the <a title=\"International Mothers' Project\" href=\"http://www.internationalmothersproject.com\" target=\"_blank\">International Mothers Project</a>\u00a0the very aim of which is to create a community for women through the sharing of personal stories. It was an unofficial launch, but poignant, given the sharing of experiences, both recent and long since past.</p>\n<p>I sound hippy-dippy when I say it, but frankly I am blessed to have found the friends I have. It certainly appears that my fear of making new friends was completely unfounded.</p>\n", "post_id": 134, "location": false, "date": "06-24-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["children", "sugar", "face painting", "Macadamia Castle", "kids parties", "school holidays", "friends", "animal petting"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/macadamia-castle2.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1343\" title=\"macadamia castle\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/macadamia-castle2.jpg?w=376&#038;h=282\" alt=\"\" width=\"376\" height=\"282\" /></a></p>\n<p>Driving along the Pacific Highway between Ballina and Byron you would no doubt have seen the attractive knight that stands proudly by his castle.

Children&#8217;s adventure playground.</p>\n<p>We went to a birthday party there today. After paying a wee\u00a0<em>fortune</em> to get in, Elka clung to me desperately to escape a chicken who came dangerously close. We made our way over to the party table, which was a banquet of&#8230;sugar. Freddo Frogs, lollies, lemonade, cake. Oh, and chips. I wasn&#8217;t sure how either of our systems would cope.</p>\n<p>Elka sat with her little friends, though kept me in close reach, for, at intermittent periods, she leapt into my lap, arms clung around my neck, yelling &#8220;It&#8217;s a duck!&#8221; &#8220;It&#8217;s a chicken!&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;m SCARED of the chicken!&#8221;</p>\n<p>The chicken was nothing compared to the llamas. Now they were plain\u00a0<em>terrifying</em>! When they came into her vision, she froze and screamed. We crept our way past those ferocious creatures, Elka clinging fast to my leg.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go find your friends,&#8221; I say.</p>\n<p>High on sugar, she loosened up, and followed a little friend to the animal petting area. &#8220;I don&#8217;t like goats!&#8221; she yelled, and the two little ones head to the rabbit petting pen. &#8220;I only like rabbits&#8221;, says Elka. She sat down with the other children, and the lady placed a blanket on her lap. Elka was wearing a green party hat to honour the occasion. Following a brief explanation about how if a child drops the rabbit, she has to put him away, the lady dumped the unsuspecting rabbit on Elka&#8217;s lap. Elka screamed out for me, and the woman grabbed the rabbit as Elka ran out of the pen.</p>\n<p>She still wanted to go see the chickens &#8211; the\u00a0<em>leetle</em> chickens. Not to touch them, or get too close, but just to see them. &#8220;I only like little chickens,&#8221; she tells me.</p>\n<p>The little chickens were OK, it seemed.</p>\n<p>But the train was the highlight. I found myself wedged between a thousand small, shrieking children. They all waved excitedly to the on-lookers as the train made its way around the farm. The pleasure of the journey made the extra $2 for the train ride worthwhile.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I need to get my face painted,&#8221; Elka\u00a0then decides, and so, in the spirit of school holidays, we sit for nearly an hour patiently waiting for her to get her face painted. The children don&#8217;t complain at all. They are happy to wait. They can see the end result &#8211; a beautiful tiger face or fairy wings or Spider Man. Who wouldn&#8217;t wait?</p>\n<p>It was a good opportunity to people gaze and wonder about other lives. Like you never really know what goes on inside a relationship, you never really know what a family is like by judging them as they sit waiting for their faces to be painted. I listened in with pleasure though to a beautiful mum, who&#8217;s white hair was cropped short, and who wore purple Doc Martins. She talked to her boy (about 8) like a friend, chatting with him, sharing anecdotes, laughing at the llama&#8217;s funny lips in his photo&#8230;It was refreshing. He was her pal. She wasn&#8217;t trying to be an uber cool mum. She just was one. I felt like leaning over to tell her how much I admired the way she talked to her son. Instead, I told the woman sitting next to me how absolutely gorgeous her kids were. Her daughter (about 12) was a budding supermodel, with incredible long ginger hair and porcelein skin. Her son was like sunshine.</p>\n<p>Elka finally got her turn, and sat with lips pursed, shoulders raised and eyes squeezed as the woman gave her a tiger face.</p>\n<p>I took my little tiger home, hoping the sugar wouldn&#8217;t have too strong an effect and impede our afternoon. Maybe next time, she&#8217;ll be happy to pet a rabbit.

Last year, we walked down our Lismore hill to enjoy festivities&#8230;Elka in the hug-a-bub fast asleep. My Mum and I couldn&#8217;t believe how amazing the lanterns were. We were expecting a bunch of kids walking down the street carrying handmade lanterns&#8230;but it was far more. There were countless huge light sculptures&#8230;of people, animals, fantastical creatures, rainbows, mushrooms. The big brass bands were adorned in colourful sequinned elaborate costume, and there were roller-skaters, fire twirlers&#8230;you name it.</p>\n<p>Going with Elka this year was a pure joy. She was mesmerised by the crowds of people.

At some point she even said &#8220;Wow!&#8221;&#8230;It was so cute. Her little arms went in a flap when the bands came marching by. At some point her little feet clad in red leather fur lined boots joined in.</p>\n<p>It was an unusually late night for us&#8230;we didn&#8217;t get home until about 7.30, and Elka demonstrated no signs of heading to bed. She was imitating the drums, and the people who carried the lanterns. She pretended to be a duck in honour of the pelican lantern I think. It was so pleasurable to see her so enthused by the carnivale.</p>\n<p>I was going to finish with a photo of the rainbow, courtesy of the Tropical Fruits, which if you get my drift is very Lismore.

It&#8217;s not really a nervous thing, just an unconscious thing&#8230;before I know it, despite my best intentions, my nails are short again.<br />\nThese are my hands.<br />\nMuddy from working in the garden, and not wearing gloves. I never wear gloves. I usually wear nice clothes in the garden, not bothered to change before I get the urge to pull out weeds. This morning we planted coriander and snow pea seedlings. I replanted the strawberries and finally put a mandarin in the ground that has been waiting for weeks to be planted. Elka helped shovel in the compost, and insisted on planting some of the seedlings. We propped up the snow peas with branches that have fallen from the tree.<br />\nThese are my hands.<br />\nI am wearing the engagement and wedding rings that belonged to my grandma. They are platinum with a diamond setting. They were my grandma&#8217;s most valuable possessions. She said she wanted me to have them when she died. She passed away nearly two years ago.

She would have loved to have known Elka would grow up in her little cottage.<br />\nI also wear my own wedding ring, which my husband and I designed, and sent pictures of the design to his family in the Netherlands. They melted down family gold and somebody they knew used the gold to make our designs. This was a way my husband&#8217;s family could be involved in he ceremony.<br />\nSoon after my daughter was born, I was making bread and put my wedding band on top of the microwave. Later that day, I realised I wasn&#8217;t wearing it. I searched everywhere. Even my husband&#8217;s hawk eyes could not find it. A week or so later, I was sharing my grief about the lost ring with my dad. Off hand, I said that it may have fallen into the compost bin for all I knew.

You have needs. I have needs. You have wants. I have wants. I am usually prepared to compromise. You need to be able to as well. We are a team, you and me. And when Mummy has to pee, you have to let Mummy pee. It&#8217;s a basic right. OK? Do you see why Mummy feels a bit sad?</em></p>\n<p>Thirty seconds earlier, I wasn&#8217;t quite so reasonable. Rather, I was one of those cranky-faced mums, swinging her pram in agitation, failing to acknowledge the kind lady who pointed out a fallen toy. I was the cranky-faced mum saying:</p>\n<p><em>So, is this what it&#8217;s come to? You say what you want&#8230;you get it. I just do everything you say&#8230;OK, great. This is crap.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>It was a crappy day. But intermittently, I reminded myself that my husband was spending his Sunday dealing with\u00a0<em>very</em> hairy situations involving people in great risk with very problematic behaviours. I was going to the markets and spending the day with <del>a slightly precocious</del> my precious toddler.</p>\n<p>Several times today, Elka burst into tears when I needed to drain my forsaken bladder (may I remind you that I am six months pregnant). It didn&#8217;t follow her agenda. But then I was crap, reluctantly sitting beside the sandpit, wishing I could be washing dishes rather than making sandcastles. She needed to read. I needed to have a shower. She needed to play with her toys. I needed to go to the market. I mistakenly put her marshmallow in her baby-cino. She needed it <em>out</em>, and cleaned of all residue of chocolate, thank you very much! I needed to sit in the sun and have a coffee &#8211; a little upper. She needed to play on the\u00a0supermarket-play-car-thingy. I needed to pee. All day, our needs and our wants conflicted.</p>\n<p>In the end, I say yes to most things. Even sitting on the\u00a0supermarket-play-car-thingy instead of going to the toilet. I bargain with myself that five minutes doing this won&#8217;t kill me. Hell, it may even make me <del>my bladder\u00a0</del> stronger. But I don&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s the best thing for either me or her. Because I usually say yes, when I have to say no, it goes down like a lead balloon. Landing on my toes.</p>\n<p>I have a few consistent <em>no&#8217;s</em> &#8211; like no Playschool in the morning or in the evening. No\u00a0marshmallows\u00a0instead of real food. No ice cream unless we&#8217;ve had lunch. No being coaxed to sit in her play area while we are eating breakfast as a family. No jumping on the big bed without Mummy or Daddy. No muddy boots in the house. Generally, she&#8217;ll ask if it&#8217;s OK to do one of these things, and I&#8217;ll say\u00a0<em>no</em> with some form of an explanation, and it&#8217;s all good.</p>\n<p>Now that we have reached the age when Elka has very definite ideas about what she wants, I find my assertive side challenged. She needs to have her face painted as a tiger. I say yes. She needs a butterfly balloon. I say yes. She needs a little plastic toy car from the op-shop. I say yes. She needs sausages. I say yes. As long as it&#8217;s a fairly reasonable request, I say yes. Now I have a predicament on my hands. Outings have become very expensive, and saying no is not a popular option.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure where to take it from here. I felt like a failed mother today. I wasn&#8217;t quite able to get it right. But maybe I should accept that like everything else, things will change. I need to practice being more assertive, and hopefully Elka will be into exercising \u00a0her sweet-natured obliging and extremely reasonable side tomorrow. Maybe I should just take it for what it was. A not overly great day. But nothing, compared to my husband&#8217;s.</p>\n<p><em>Epilogue</em><br />\nAll was redeemed this evening at the playground in Lennox Head. The afternoon sun was smiling down on us. We ate ice cream as a family. Elka played with all the little children, and made one special little friend. She and her friend ran from the cubby house under the playground, offering us leaves, flowers, bark and seeds. They laughed and laughed together, falling over each other, laughing some more. They were so utterly gorgeous, glowing in the afternoon light; their spirits so joyous and so generous. Elka has suddenly reached an age where she no longer hangs back with her parents at the playground, watching the other children with a serious expression. She is right in the mix, playing, creating and making friends. Like I said, all was redeemed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "post_id": 1406, "location": false, "date": "07-15-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["baby", "sleep", "children", "babies"], "text": "<p>There have been so many changes over the last few weeks for Elka and I. Only about three weeks ago, I never thought I would be able to stop breastfeeding Elka. She was just so attached. And when I introduced the concept of &#8220;let&#8217;s do other things&#8221; she took to it swimmingly. As she did with sleeping through the night. My next challenge was actually getting Elka to sleep in the first place.</p>\n<p>From rocking her for nearly an hour every night, bopping around Lismore with her in the hug-a-bub, walking countless hours with her in the pram, driving blocks of Alstonville singing to her in the car&#8230;and for the last year, lying up to an hour with her in the dark breastfeeding her to sleep. Most of the time, with Tizzy Hall ringing in my brain, I thought, this has to be ridiculous. And a part of me just knew that Elka was a different child. She couldn&#8217;t do that lying in her cot with a dummy thing. No way never. Her little body would fling itself across the room before that was going to happen.</p>\n<p>But tonight, ladies and gents, as Leonard Cohen would say: Hallelujah. I tucked that little girl into my body, put on some Ali Farka Toure and softly danced her into a lull, at which point I laid her down into the bed and she FELL ASLEEP! It took five minutes!! I am then running around the room jumping up and down ecstatically (but silently as not to wake her). I seriously thought this moment would never come! I have had so much anxiety and sleep dilemma. Reading Tizzy Hall whilst pregnant certainly didn&#8217;t help. Nor did seeing other bubs lying asleep in their prams in the supermarket.

I don&#8217;t care.<br />\nWhat I care about is her warm hand against my face as she falls asleep. I care about her snuggling into me, saying <em>I love you sooooo much&#8230;</em>.

Apparently it refers to the battle between mums who work and those that don&#8217;t. Or between mums who co-sleep and those who don&#8217;t. Or between mums who use controlled crying and those that don&#8217;t. Or between mums who breastfeed their children for two or more years and those who don&#8217;t. \u00a0Or between mums who vaccinate and those who don&#8217;t.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mamamia.com.au/parenting/60-minutes-enough-with-the-mummy-wars/\">Kerri Sackville</a>\u00a0wrote in response to the<a href=\"http://sixtyminutes.ninemsn.com.au/stories/8502003/on-demand\"> 60 Minutes piece about Attachment Parenting</a>\u00a0that was screened on the weekend. She was pleading with the media to quit pitting mums against each other and accept that as mums, we are OK with how others parent, even if it is different from what we do.</p>\n<p>I agree with her that women generally are OK with what other mothers do. I know loads of mums who do things differently than I do, and that&#8217;s fine. There is no war. In fact, there is barely ever any debate about things. In my experience, most mums I know happily hear each other out and are more interested in maintaining a peaceful friendship than challenging a status on co-sleeping, or whatever.</p>\n<p>I do think though that healthy debate or discussion (not war) is acceptable. I also think it&#8217;s a good thing to look into how you want to parent, and make a conscious decision about the parent you want to be. It can be totally overwhelming, because there is so much information and the goal posts are constantly changing. I think it&#8217;s important to look into what is considered normal, and question if it is the best thing for you and your child.</p>\n<p>For instance, the whole sleep debate gets me. I sat on the floor of Borders 6 months pregnant reading Tizzy Hall&#8217;s <em><a href=\"http://www.saveoursleep.com.au/\">Save our Sleep</a>\u00a0</em>and decided this was the life for me. Once having a child though, routines flew out the window. So did the notion that my child would sleep away from us in another room. And we definitely knew that comfort crying wasn&#8217;t for us or our child. We couldn&#8217;t leave a little one alone in a room, howling her little head off, while we sat tortured on the other side of the door. Comfort crying (controlled crying) and sleep routines are accepted practice and the majority of parents I know have at some point resorted to this strategy. But just because something is normal, doesn&#8217;t mean it has to be right for you or your child. Maybe it&#8217;s worth looking into a little more.</p>\n<p>The (dare I say the word) <em>vaccination</em> debate is rife in my part of the world. Most parents I know hold strongly onto the fact that they will not vaccinate their babies. Here, we had to go against the grain too. On the eve of the first immunisation appointment, my husband and I sat up researching and debating furiously. There were so many contrary points of view and so many strong opinions against vaccination, it was hard to make a decision. In the end, the literature stacked up on the side of vaccination. And as we ploughed further through it, looking up links, reading articles in full, looking at graphs in their original context etc. we reached a very conclusive decision that vaccination was the way to go, as much as it hurt our souls to take our tiny baby in to have a needle.</p>\n<p>So, I think it is (and should be) possible to have a peaceful cup of tea with other mums and talk about the ins and outs of how you reached a particular parenting decision. It&#8217;s definitely not a Mummy War &#8211; perhaps more an exploration of the parenting landscape&#8230;a healthy thing to do. It is only through conversation, investigation and exploration that we can challenge social norms (if we need to) and find the path in the parenting world that best suit us and our children. As Mia Freedman wrote in the editor&#8217;s note following Kerri&#8217;s article, <a href=\"http://www.mamamia.com.au/parenting/60-minutes-enough-with-the-mummy-wars/\">&#8220;when men disagree about something, it\u2019s not called \u201cThe Men wars\u201d.

Elka sets eyes on them, and there is no way we can deny her. So we sit down with the bubbas and a cup of tea and the delicious cupcakes, and Elka enjoys every second of that chocolate extravaganza. The chocolate is in her hair, and on her toes.</p>\n<p>Later on, we are eating lunch and the bubbas are doing their thang. Next thing, I look over and Elka is standing in her kitchen tower (lovingly constructed as a hardcore safety device for Elka to stand in whilst helping in the kitchen). She has helped herself to yet another cupcake. The evidence is all over her face.</p>\n<p>Later still, we have been brave enough to bring out our craft supplies, and Elka kindly brings over a credit card belonging to one of the ladies. She then brings over her keys, and then she disappears around the corner quietly. Suddenly my friend leaps to her feet &#8211; &#8220;I just realised there is a block of chocolate in my bag!&#8221; Low and behold, Elka is sitting proud as punch munching on the block one square at a time.</p>\n<p>Needless to say the rest of the afternoon wasn&#8217;t the relaxing craftanoon I had in mind. Without her sleep and high on cocoa, Elka buzzed around noisily, and apparently the mood was contagious. It was still a delightful day of course!</p>\n<p>We have always been pretty flexible with Elka&#8217;s diet. She started with an avocado, and we have gone from there. She ate meat early on, and despite the advice of naturopathic friends, dairy, bread and eggs. I usually drew the line at sugar. My eczema is triggered by sugar, so I know it does something. We had the occasional lapse at a birthday party, and her little face would go a bit red, and her vivacious temperament would\u00a0exacerbate.</p>\n<p>And tonight, our usually happy little girl has been rolling around on the ground, crying and kicking her little legs. I think I may have to draw a harder line at sugar.</p>\n", "post_id": 143, "location": false, "date": "07-01-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Thankful Thursday", "gratitude", "Kate Says Stuff", "children", "family"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/giftofgiving.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1432\" title=\"giftofgiving\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/giftofgiving.jpg?w=480&#038;h=329\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"329\" /></a></p>\n<p>Linking up with <a href=\"http://www.katesaysstuff.com/2012/07/thankful-thursday-presents-for-you.html\" target=\"_blank\">Kate Says Stuff&#8217;s</a> Thankful Thursdays&#8230;</p>\n<p>I went to a beautiful mother&#8217;s group this morning led by Janine from <a href=\"http://postnatalnaturally.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Post-Natal Naturally</a>, which was about natural ways to manage stress and anxiety.

It was an exciting post for me, because it generated a lot of intelligent discussion. One of the main themes that emerged from the comments was the idea of a &#8220;Mummy Community&#8221;. Mothers are happy to talk amongst each other about parenting issues &#8211; they like receiving feedback and ideas from other mums. If ideas are debated, they tend to be done in a gentle, amicable fashion over a cup of tea. Mums particularly need the support from other mums.\u00a0The general consensus in the comments was that Mummy Wars is a media fiction, or if it does exist, it lives in forums and Facebook communities, where passions soar, but words are not necessarily kindly said. As one <a href=\"http://relaxandfloatdownstream.wordpress.com/\">woman</a> commented, <a href=\"http://heartmama.net/2012/07/25/mummy-war/#comments\">&#8220;If you\u2019re looking for a supportive community, you won\u2019t find it amongst the mothers who have turned the forum into their own personal sandbox.&#8221;</a></p>\n<p>So, instead of Mummy Wars, let&#8217;s focus on the Mummy Community. Far more constructive.</p>\n<p>It seems, by talking to other mums and hearing from mums through my blog, that one of the most crucial ingredients for nourishing little hearts is to be supported and surrounded by other mums. Like a plant needs water, us mums need our support. Someone to talk nappies with (and possibly even exchange poo stories). Someone who understands what a sleepless night is like. We need someone who knows about prams, and someone who knows about slings. We need someone to sympathise with us, and give us a big, warm,\u00a0bosomy\u00a0hug. Us mums are the world&#8217;s biggest networkers &#8211; spreading our tendrils until we reach something we need. We hold it, and pull it in. We pull in those who support us.</p>\n<p>My mother community began on a macadamia farm in northern NSW. It was, at the time, the home of the <a href=\"http://www.naturalbirth.org.au/\">Natural Birth Education and Resource Centre</a>. We sat on the verandah of the old worker&#8217;s cottage, sipping tea and sharing our woes and our desires. Some of us travelled for over an hour to be there each week. It was a safe place to pull out our boobs to breastfeed, to ask someone for a cup of tea or to bop up and down while our baby slept in the sling. Our mother&#8217;s group grew to include new &#8220;members&#8221; over the last two years. Although we don&#8217;t all meet up regularly, we have splintered into fractions, and occasionally use our &#8220;main email list&#8221; to communicate with everyone in the group.</p>\n<p>This week on <a href=\"https://www.mumgo.com.au/blog.php?article=689\">Mumgo</a>, I wrote about the need for a village &#8211; that is, the support from those around us to raise our children. Traditionally, the village was the mum, grandma, aunts, sisters, cousins, nieces and neighbours. They carried our babies in slings and sometimes breastfed them. Now, some of us live a million light years away from our relatives; expats in foreign lands. Others have family on the other side of the country. Perhaps, if you are lucky, you know who your neighbours are. But chances are, all you will know about them is that they drive a blue Suburu Forester, and they mow weekly. This is why, in our modern day world, the Mother-hood has become increasingly important. We need the hood of mummies to survive.</p>\n<p>The Motherhood is on the Internet. There are many many Facebook communities and blogs (you may like to suggest some of your favourites below). You can join a group, and ask any question you like at any time of the day or night and you are guaranteed an immediate response. \u00a0There are hubs for working mums, <a href=\"http://www.stayathomemum.net.au/\">stay-at-home mums (SAHM)</a>, mums who baby-wear, mums who don&#8217;t smack children, <a href=\"http://mamabake.com/\">mums who bake in groups</a>&#8230;You just have to find the hubs that work for you and speak your language.\u00a0(Just avoid nasty sandboxes).</p>\n<p>Hopefully, the Motherhood is also in your physical village, or at least a phone call away. Some of my hood live in Melbourne, and one mother is next door. When I have a need, I send out a tendril, and someone is always at the receiving end. Wherever, whoever.</p>\n<p>I hope you have a Motherhood, and if you don&#8217;t, contact me or leave a comment below, and I am sure between all of us mums we can find you what you need.</p>\n<p>Linking up with:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong><em>To nourish little hearts, we need a village.

One more day won&#8217;t make any difference.</em></p>\n<p>I need to edit those papers and those middens. I have a baby due in two months. These are two of the things that need to be neatly omitted from my to-do-list. As an act of compassion to myself.</p>\n<p>There are other things that need my editorial attention.</p>\n<p>We consistently leave the house in an incredibly stressful rush. Our appointments aren&#8217;t usually that crucial &#8211; a coffee with a friend or yoga class. I am rushing around, grabbing shoes for Elki, jutie, fruit, a change of clothes, trying to brush her hair, brush her teeth&#8230;and she is rushing around, telling me we are in a rush, and looking for her bag &#8211; &#8220;Mummy, where&#8217;s my bag? I need my bag! No, not that one. The one with butterflies. The blue one! Mummy, where is Betsy gone? I need Betsy!&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Elka, darling, we need to go! We are in a rush. I have no idea where Betsy is.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;But I\u00a0<em>need\u00a0</em>her!&#8221;</p>\n<p>By the time we are all in the car, strapped in, with Betsy strapped in next to Elka (she was in the pram), I need to listen to nursery rhymes to calm down. It&#8217;s ridiculous. And poor little Elki obviously picks up on my stress, filing it into her emotional dictionary.</p>\n<p>What can I do to make these edits?</p>\n<p>I can approach one midden at a time. Take my handbag, and empty it out. Start again. As a friend once said, when it feels like your life is in chaos, start with your purse. Clean it out. Then move onto the handbag. Before you know it, you will have cleaned the windows. One. Midden. At. A. Time.</p>\n<p>I can start on that paperwork. Tomorrow.</p>\n<p>And I can chill a little the next time we need to leave the house. Maybe I can start preparations earlier (is that even possible?) Give it two hours instead of one. Put the fruit, the jutie, the change of clothes and Betsy in the basket well before take off. And breathe&#8230;it&#8217;s just a coffee. My friend will be forgiving if we are five minutes late.</p>\n<p>These are the edits I need to make. There are more. Like being more patient. More present. More sympathetic. Nicer to my husband. Nicer to myself.</p>\n<p>As an act of compassion to myself and my family I will apply myself, despite my greatest resistance against editing, to the changes I need to make, to make life happier, more peaceful and more tidy for all.</p>\n<p>Linking up with:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.withsomegrace.com/fybf-2/\"><br />\n<img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/i1058.photobucket.com/albums/t405/digitalparentsaus/fybf.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"155\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 1448, "location": false, "date": "08-01-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["medicine", "second baby", "children", "family", "healing"], "text": "<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/thebridgepost\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1470\" title=\"trust\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/trust.jpg?w=480&#038;h=360\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>We healed each other.</em></p>\n<p>Yesterday, our poor little child had to be restrained while she was forced to swallow\u00a0penicillin\u00a0for a foot infection. It was hell, for all of us, particularly her. Of course, I worried that we had lost her sweet trust forever. She lay in our arms, sobbing and sobbing. She did\u00a0<em>not\u00a0</em> want that medicine. It tasted so horrible &#8211; but we made her have it.</p>\n<p>She fell asleep in my arms in the late afternoon. For over three hours, we lay together. She woke every time I moved a hair, and cried some more. The part of me that needs to be\u00a0<em>doing</em> and\u00a0<em>busy</em> resisted. The part of me (the pregnant part) that needs to rest and simply\u00a0<em>be</em> enjoyed every second of lying in the dark with my dear child. I wanted her to heal. All I could do was stay there for her.</p>\n<p>When she finally woke properly (at 7pm!), she was her delightful, happy self again. Healed.</p>\n<p><em>She healed me.</em></p>\n<p>I woke this morning heavy-hearted. Stressed. Overwhelmed. I am having a baby in less than two months. My husband is working seven days a week for the next three weeks (at least) and I have to work every moment he is at home. My house is disorganised. My life is cluttered.</p>\n<p>I have not done anything to prepare for this baby &#8211; materially or emotionally. Baby clothes are all packed up in boxes and bags in the loft. And I have had no time or space to\u00a0<em>nest</em>. My last three months of being pregnant with Elka were spent nesting, nurturing myself, connecting to my husband and resting. I knew it would be different this time&#8230;but at 5am this morning, I was ridden with guilt that I was not doing enough for the baby I&#8217;m carrying. I&#8217;m not prepared for it at all.</p>\n<p>All I knew about today was that I couldn&#8217;t stay at home, indoors, wallowing in self-pity. Elka and I hit the town, sat in the sun drinking juice, played on the sea-saw, wandered around Lismore aimlessly, sat in the shade eating a picnic&#8230; Her sweet joyous chatter drew me out of myself and my worries. All will be OK, unprepared for newborn and all.</p>\n<p><em>She healed me with her sweetness and sunshine.</em></p>\n<p>Tonight, taking her medicine, she was a trooper.

Sometimes (like today) I crave them. I am a pregnant mama in nesting mode. I desperately needed to wash and fold small baby clothes. I needed to wipe cobwebs from outside windows and doors. I needed to pull up weeds. <a href=\"http://heartmama.net/2012/08/01/edits-i-need-to-make/\">I needed to combat several middens that had accumulated</a>.

Then when the time was right, she unfurled, and played in and around the train with the other children, laughing and chatting to them. &#8220;Look Mama, that little friend is riding the train!&#8221; She glows, radiant and warm, and follows another little friend to the sandpit.</em></p>\n<p>Across the playground, another child swings high&#8230;higher and higher. She loves to swing high, giggling as her swing is almost horizontal, even though she is only four-ish. Her mother is enjoying it too &#8211; pushing her higher and higher, laughing with her little girl. The other mothers arrive for what looks to be a mother&#8217;s convention, set around a gingham table cloth on a park bench. The mother of the little girl walks away, and leaves her girl hanging. The girl yells, &#8220;More, Mama!&#8221; Her mother ignores her. &#8220;More, Mama! More!&#8221; Her mother yells back, &#8220;Get over it Tahli*. Just get over yourself.&#8221; The little girl (Tahli) starts to sob. She is too small to get out of the swing, and obviously can&#8217;t get it swinging by herself. I watch with a sad heart. Should I get up and push her, or help her out of the swing? The mother&#8217;s convention set around a gingham table cloth on a park bench frightens me, so I stay dwelling in the sunshine, against a pole, as my daughter plays in and around the train and the sandpit.</p>\n<p>I think a little more <a href=\"http://heartmama.net/2012/08/09/my-little-friend/\">about friendship with our children</a>&#8230;Perhaps friendship is the perfect model to parent within. Here is what I thought:</p>\n<p><em>We treat our friends with respect, love and compassion. If we don&#8217;t, they will walk away. Our friends see the best version of ourselves because we don&#8217;t want to lose them.</em></p>\n<p>Our children are not equal to us, in the way friends are meant to be. They are younger, smaller, more vulnerable, more dependent. Just as a doctor should separate her professional life from her personal life, and not befriend her patients, a parent&#8217;s role is to discipline, teach, guard and protect the child, not befriend them. And yet ~</p>\n<p><em>We treat our friends with respect, love and compassion. If we don&#8217;t, they will walk away. Our friends see the best version of ourselves\u00a0<em>because we don&#8217;t want to lose them.</em></em></p>\n<p>Perhaps, if we \u00a0have for our children the same respect, love and compassion we have for our friends, our relationship with them would be strengthened.</p>\n<p>Watching the mother&#8217;s convention set around a gingham table cloth on a park bench and one sad little girl hanging alone on a swing, I thought that if her mother were to be her friend, she would hear what the little girl was saying; show respect, love and compassion, and either push her for another minute or so on the swing, or help her get out. She wouldn&#8217;t leave her to cry. She wouldn&#8217;t yell, &#8220;Get over yourself.&#8221;</p>\n<p>We don&#8217;t need to train our children. Our children will be the love they are shown. The compassion they receive. The kindness they receive. They will, I&#8217;m sure.</p>\n<p>Nourishing our little hearts with love, kindness, tenderness and sunshine will raise our seedlings into the best version of themselves. Treating our little ones as we would treat our friends gives us the tools we need to nourish.</p>\n<p>So, as I dwell in the sunshine, and watch little leaves unfurl <em>playing in and around the train with the other children, laughing and chatting</em>, I feel thankful to have a friendship with my daughter. I am thankful that we share respect, love and compassion for each other.

We have just been to the <a title=\"GSAC\" href=\"http://www.gsac.net.au/\">Goonellabah Sports and Aquatic Centre</a>\u00a0&#8211; a water wonderland for adults and children alike, and an unusually fantastic facility for a rural town &#8211; and I am pretty sure that the majority of punters were fathers and their children. It was noticeable because usually during the week when I take Elka to the park, I encounter the rare father, who sips a short black instead of a skinny decaf latte. The occasional dad stands out at the park during the week. The occasional mum stands out at the aquatic centre on the weekend.</p>\n<p>I have heard of shared parenting, and listening to<a title=\"Life Matters\" href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/rn/lifematters/\"> Life Matters</a>\u00a0every morning, it appears it is becoming fairly normal. Shared parenting is the sort where the dads, instead of reading the paper in the morning and hurrying to work while mum looks after the kids all day, stays home with the kids, and take them to the park, while mum goes out to work. Some people I know split the week, a few days of work each. Awesome. Everyone is pretty satisfied by this arrangement, right?</p>\n<p>We certainly share parent in my family. I am lucky to have a husband who gets by working a few days a week. The rest of the time he is home, and has consequently spent many an afternoon taking Elka for a sleep, or taking her to the park, while I do some study, or work on the website, or something. This has got to be the way of the future. Dads get to spend more time with their kids, and hence have a stronger bond, and mums get to pursue other activities other than mothering, which for most women I know is darn important.</p>\n<p>But if today&#8217;s experience at the aquatic centre is anything to go by, maybe Saturday is dads&#8217; day, and the rest of the week, mum has the kids. It is telling that when I asked one of the fathers what his partner was up to that day, he said &#8220;cleaning the house&#8221;. Right, well there you go. Maybe shared parenting is still in the future. Or maybe it&#8217;s closer than we think &#8211; &#8220;I&#8217;m going home to vacuum when she&#8217;s done&#8221;, the dad in question then adds.

We sing little songs about nothing. We put baskets on our head and run to the letter box. We use silly voices. We do ring-a-ring-a-rosie. We play chasies in the garden. We dance with ribbons to Otis Redding. When my husband is around, playing is effortless fun. Playing does not take a toll, or make us adults feel like monkeys. We play like we breathe.</p>\n<p><em>&#8220;Hey, guys, shall we dance around in circles?&#8221; asks Elka, as we finish our dinner.</em></p>\n<p>But when my husband goes to work, I find myself struggling to get up the stamina to sit next to the sandpit and build a sand castle, or jump on the bed like a monkey. I am good at reading a few books on the couch with my little girl, but beyond that, I struggle.</p>\n<p>I wonder about my internal aversion against playing&#8230;why is it there? And is it going to go away before my child is a teenager, and can&#8217;t think of anything worse than her mum playing games with her.</p>\n<p>I think, for me, it is a matter of choice. Before having a child, I would have thought hanging out with a toddler all day, mucking around, crafting etc. was a dream run. But now that mucking around all day, crafting etc. is on toddler terms, not mine, I feel like it is more obligation than play. My choice would be to sit in front of a computer, and read blogs, or write. Some days I even prefer to work on my computer, which is ironic, really, given that when I was working full-time, playing sounded far better. Some days I even prefer to do house chores, which is very ironic!</p>\n<p>Shawn&#8217;s e-book,\u00a0<span style=\"color:#000080;\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><a href=\"http://awesomelyawake.com/the-playful-family/\">The Playful Family</a></span></span>\u00a0inspires parents to find opportunities to be playful and enjoy family life.

This is the story of a young woman, only 25, who is fit and healthy and strong. She had the most normal of pregnancies, and was waiting in anticipation for her &#8220;normal birth&#8221; to begin. When it didn&#8217;t, things escalated&#8230;the labour was longer and more intense than expected, and at the end of it all, she nearly lost her life.</p>\n<p>When she was wheeled out of ICU to connect with her perfect baby and beautiful husband, she was awakened to life and to her gift of a second chance. This was a girl you would never see falter at anything, and in the end, if it weren&#8217;t for the amazing and immediate response of hospital staff who were on call at that moment, she may not have been here today.</p>\n<p>I looked at this strong and gorgeous woman in amazement, tears in my eyes, and was reminded again about the power of child birth. We sometimes forget how vulnerable we are and our babies are in the moment of giving birth. There are so many variables. In one moment, we become fallible&#8230;human. Thankfully, we live in a time when most of us and our babies survive.</p>\n<p><em>Mothers are warriors.</em></p>\n<p>During my last pregnancy, my yoga teacher declared that standing in warrior pose was gentle preparation for motherhood. In warrior pose, we stand strong, erect, our feet grounded, our arms open. Although it is a masculine analogy, I thought of warrior pose many times&#8230;bearing down as my daughter tried to make her way into the world&#8230;lying in a darkened room with a child who never seemed like she would stop crying and go to sleep&#8230;sitting in the hospital waiting room, <a href=\"http://heartmama.net/2011/12/12/tooth-decay-the-final-instalment/\">while my beloved daughter was under full anaesthetic having her teeth repaired</a>&#8230;crouching down, tired and pregnant, as my daughter rolled on the floor screaming with emotion&#8230;These are the times warrior pose comes to mind, and I ground my feet, lift my chin and open my arms and heart.</p>\n<p><em>Motherhood can send us to the brink and back.</em></p>\n<p>So today I am thankful that my gorgeous friend and her baby are alive and, in fact, flourishing.</p>\n<p>I am grateful we live in a time when most women and their babies live after childbirth.</p>\n<p>I am grateful for our inner strength as mothers and our capacity to be open to hardship, to grow from it and to learn from it.</p>\n<p>{Linking up with Thankful Thursdays on <a href=\"http://www.katesaysstuff.com/\">Kate Says Stuff</a>\u00a0and Flog You Blog Friday on\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.withsomegrace.com/\">With Some Grace</a>}</p>\n", "post_id": 1499, "location": false, "date": "08-16-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["family", "tenderness", "house", "nourishing children with love", "our home", "parenting", "home", "children"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/img_1451.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1511\" title=\"my house\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/img_1451.jpg?w=480&#038;h=320\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"320\" /></a></p>\n<p>This is our house.</p>\n<p>It isn&#8217;t that pretty, or fancy, or flash.

My only regret is that Joyce didn&#8217;t know that the only great-grandchild she got to meet would be raised in her little cottage.</p>\n<p>Joyce&#8217;s cottage was so dear to her. When she went to hospital at the age of 92, and it looked like she would not be able to go back home to live independently, Joyce defiantly shut her mouth for the first time in her life. She refused to eat and when she spoke, it was in a whisper. She would depart this life, she decided, if she couldn&#8217;t go home to her cottage and her golden retriever.</p>\n<p>The minute we moved in, it wasn&#8217;t Joyce&#8217;s house any more. Strangely, it doesn&#8217;t even remind me of her, even though it&#8217;s been\u00a0<em>her</em> house most of my living memory. Maybe that&#8217;s what a home does&#8230;when you move in to its shell, it takes your form and moulds and shapes around you, like comfortable, worn pyjamas.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/img_1453.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1512\" title=\"shower\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/img_1453.jpg?w=480&#038;h=320\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"320\" /></a></p>\n<p>This is our shower.</p>\n<p>Home to imagination, home-spun songs and stories. I shower every morning with Elki, and when I get out, she sits in the recess with her collection of toys and bottles and bowls and sings and makes up stories.

But, it is Elka&#8217;s corner to do as she pleases. Again, I am fascinated and entertained by the stories and songs that emerge, whimsical and vibrant, involving Betsy or horsey or a hoola-hoop.

I was looking over at a girl who was much older than me, and was ye olde five star A-class schoolyard bully. Her name was Belinda, and she was, as usual, throwing her weight around. Belinda caught our bus. One day, my little brother was \u00a0carrying a little book home to mum for Mother&#8217;s Day, which he had written and illustrated in scripture class. Belinda, for some unknown reason, took great pleasure in grabbing his book and chucking it out the bus window, on route.</p>\n<p>Back to the bus queue, and there was me, little kid, big brown cow eyes under fringe, staring at Belinda. She of course came up to me, pushed me, and said &#8220;Watcha staring at? Little freak!&#8221;</p>\n<p>The moral of this story is that I have always been a starer. A watcher of people. An observer. My little two-year-old is the same&#8230;it takes her five minutes to walk through the aquatic complex to the change rooms because she is so fascinated by the other people in the pool.</p>\n<p>Being a people watcher has its drawbacks, like being pushed by the schoolyard bully. But it has its advantages. From watching, I learn.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what I have learnt from strangers&#8230;</p>\n<p><strong>A child can be your friend</strong></p>\n<p>A woman sat next to her twelve-year-old-son at the Macadamia Castle. Her hair was bleached blonde and cropped tight. She leant into her son, who was holding his iPad, and chuckled. &#8220;That llama looks pretty weird,&#8221; she said. The boy smiled. Her voice was so warm as she then chatted to him, telling him about someone they knew, as if her son was her age, or she was his. Two friends, sitting side-by-side, just having a conversation as two friends do.</p>\n<p><strong>Losing your crap at the playground does not look cool</strong></p>\n<p>Two kids sped around and around the playground, one chasing the other, who was on a scooter. &#8220;Stop!&#8221; yelled their mother. They didn&#8217;t. &#8220;Right,&#8221; yelled their mother, and she grabbed one of them and his scooter and yanked him by the arm. The child cried out, but she continued to pull him and his scooter away from the playground. In front of everyone, she yelled at him, smacked him on the bottom and then walked away, leaving him to cry. It wasn&#8217;t cool. Whatever the kids had done or not done, it wasn&#8217;t cool.</p>\n<p><strong>Allowing a child to roam gives them confidence and security</strong></p>\n<p>At the same playground a few months later, a toddler, barely one, waddled gleefully away from the playground towards to road. She was wearing sweet little white\u00a0dungarees\u00a0and a cheeky smile. Her mother ambled after her, not in any rush, just an amble. She picked the little one up just before the road and put her back in the playground. Again, the little one waddled away towards to road. Again, the mother ambled after her, and placed her down in the playground. They did this routine two or three times more, but there was never any fuss, or any reprimand. The little one, so strong and confident on her feet, wore her cheeky smile with pride, and the mother remained relaxed and playful, pulling her back when it was dangerous, but otherwise giving her the space to roam free.</p>\n<p><strong>A child isn&#8217;t a rude child, a naughty child, or a good child</strong></p>\n<p>At the swimming pool today, a woman spoke firmly to her five-year-old girl. She told her she was a rude girl, and rude girls do not get to go dancing. Only good girls go dancing. Rude girls go home. So she wouldn&#8217;t be going dancing. The girl barely bothered to cry into her towel. Meanwhile, the woman&#8217;s toddler sat next to them in his pram, and threatened to choke on a piece of paper, which until pointed out, went unnoticed by the mother. I wondered why it was so important for the mother to make sure her child knew she was a rude girl. What value did it serve? The only option the girl had was to be a rude girl. All rud-ish character traits that emerged hence after would only confirm the fact that she was a rude girl. What good is labelling a child rude, naughty or good?</p>\n<p>Of course, watching strangers is a mere flash of the stranger&#8217;s reality, and only interpretations and assumptions are made, which are based on my own beliefs, values and experiences. But I do learn from strangers, every day. They may not be the lessons the strangers intended, but when observing, I take the lesson, and pocket it as my own, weaving it into my life&#8217;s embroidery.</p>\n<p><em>What have you learnt from a stranger, lately?</em></p>\n<p>{Linking with Flog Your Blog Friday with the lovely Grace at\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.withsomegrace.com/\">With Some Grace</a>\u00a0and Twinkle in the Eye for Flash Blog <a href=\"http://www.twinkleintheeyeblog.com/\">Friday</a>}</p>\n", "post_id": 1515, "location": false, "date": "08-23-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["birth", "parenthood", "babies", "pregnancy", "siblings", "second child"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/20120825-151432.jpg\"><img src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/20120825-151432.jpg\" alt=\"20120825-151432.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n<p>From the beginning, Elka was interested in the baby. In fact, she told me it was in my tummy before I had done a pregnancy test. </p>\n<p>At six weeks, I lay in the bath with her, and she told me I looked like Humpty Dumpty. I was amazed she could even tell I had a tummy, but apparently it was like so obvious, Mum.</p>\n<p>At seven weeks she told one of my closest friends that I had a baby in my tummy. &#8220;Really, Zanni?&#8221; my friend looked over at me. I couldn&#8217;t keep a poker face. Elka proceeded to tell half of my friendship group, until keeping my pregnancy a secret for twelve weeks was impossible. </p>\n<p>Greg had to work, so Elka came with me for the twelve week scan. She sat next to me on the bed, and watched with fascination as the lady scanned. She could point out the legs and the feet, the head, the arms. For days after, she talked about watching the baby on the video.</p>\n<p>She came to all my appointments with the midwife, and listened, her little face open and attentive, for the heartbeat, which she told us <em>sounds like water</em>.</p>\n<p>She came to the twenty week scan and again paid close attention. The new game at home became propping mum up on the couch to check the baby. She covered my legs with a bath towel, clutched her hand into a fist and moved it around my bare tummy. She told me she could hear the heart and see the legs and the arms and it was all looking good. Then she entered the details into her &#8216;puter. </p>\n<p>When people ask if she&#8217;s excited to have a little brother or sister, she pulls up her own shirt and says <em>she&#8217;s</em> having a baby. She is fascinated by the little baby clothes I have been washing and is rapt by the double pram we just just picked up on the Gold Coast. Just the thought of sitting next to <em>her</em> baby in the pram lights up her little face. </p>\n<p>In the last week we have been talking about how the baby goes from the tummy to the outside. A friend recently had her baby, and Elka seemed to grasp the concept that the baby came out. Rubbing my belly the other day, she asked, <em>But how?</em></p>\n<p>I&#8217;m all for openness and honesty, so we got out the old lily pad (iPad) and pulled up movies of women giving birth. Potentially she could have been grossed out or scared. But she leant into me, and beamed as the baby&#8217;s head emerged from the woman&#8217;s vagina. I was weeping and she was bouncing next to me excitedly. <em>The baby came out! The baby came out!</em></p>\n<p>I know it isn&#8217;t conventional, but part of me hopes Elka will be able to be present at the birth of my next baby. She sleeps beside us, is with us every waking moment&#8230;it feels weird that she might not be there for one of the most significant moments in our lives. </p>\n<p>Gone are the days when the stork delivered the baby to the front door, and the older sibling had to just suck it up. I&#8217;m glad Elka has been with me on this journey and seems to be taking it on board. It&#8217;s a privilege to share it all with my darling girl.</p>\n", "post_id": 1523, "location": false, "date": "08-25-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["photographs", "michael crawford", "parenting", "children", "date with my past"], "text": "<p>I had a date with my past a few nights ago.

In one box, there were four half-filled journals, and two empty ones. I know for a fact that there are at least another ten still in storage. The first began\u00a0<em>Wednes 11th July 1990. Today was my birthday. I was seven years old. I went to the bird sanctuary. We saw lots of animals&#8230;\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>A much later entry, when I was sixteen read\u00a0<em>I&#8217;m kneeling on my bed right now, and I feel&#8230;awful. I don&#8217;t know what it is. Nothing happened. I just feel so empty inside&#8230;</em></p>\n<p>I wrote plays that my cousins and I performed at Christmas concerts for the adults.</p>\n<p>I kept books full of poems, and framed the ones I liked best.</p>\n<p>I wrote stories. Many stories. This one was my first, written on an old type writer in 1990 when I was six.</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>The Funny Trip to Alawena.</em></p>\n<p><em>Mum told me to run away to Alawena. So I placed my bag and ran out the door. First I passed a gentleman. He said his name was Guy. I said &#8220;That&#8217;s a very smart name for you.&#8221; I said. And off he went. And off I went too. Then I met the Queen. She was very keen on me. So on my way I went. Then I was hafe way up the hill. So I dissided to rest. Enyway it was dark. So I put up my tent and went to sleep. The next day I set off on my jirny up the hill. I was soon up on top of the hill. And there was Alawena.

The radiologist kept asking me in a typical Lismore fashion, &#8220;What does your <em>instinct</em> tell you? Do you feel pregnant?&#8221; I was looking over at a scan of my uterus and all I could see was a \u00a0black space shaped like an egg. The radiologist eventually got around to telling me that one of four of the following was going on. Either 1. I had never been pregnant, and my body had mimicked the stages of pregnancy, even forming a sac. 2. I had had an incomplete miscarriage &#8211; my body had destroyed the foetus, and the sac remained. 3. I was in a much earlier stage of pregnancy than initially thought and the scan couldn&#8217;t detect the foetus at this early stage. Or, and this was very unlikely, 4. I had an ectopic pregnancy, where the foetus implants outside of the uterus &#8211; something that is very dangerous to the mother.</p>\n<p>He eventually put his money on number 2. incomplete miscarriage (those were his words), and the black and empty space on the ultrasound said it all. He sent me down to ED with a warning that when faced with &#8220;options&#8221; for dealing with an incomplete miscarriage &#8211; i.e. let it complete naturally, or have a D&amp;C &#8211; I was to decide for myself which option to take, and not be talked into one over another. Lying under the fluorescents again for another couple of hours, on my own, waiting for Greg in ED, I felt, of course, very sad. Our fears were (somewhat) confirmed &#8211; I was miscarrying. It was highly unlikely I could still be pregnant. All I could see was that little black shape. I tried to take my mind off things by reading my Psychology text book, but eventually gave in, threw the book on the ground, and lay with my head under a blanket with a box of tissues. I&#8217;m not usually one for crying \u00a0other than in romantic movies, but it couldn&#8217;t be helped.</p>\n<p>They discharged me again and referred me to see the Early Pregnancy Assessment Unit, where I should have been sent straight away. I was stable, and didn&#8217;t need emergency.</p>\n<p>That night at home I began to experience pain. I went to bed, dreading ringing the Nurse Help Line again for fear of being sent back to Emergency. I woke in the night with more pain, but was able to go back to sleep. In the morning, I realised that the pain was in fact contractions. Similar to childbirth, in that they came and went, about three minutes apart, but at about 30% of the strength. Still bloody painful. It was all over reasonably quickly, and I &#8220;gave birth&#8221; to a little sac which contained the very beginnings of a placenta but no more.</p>\n<p>In truth, I felt relieved. The pain had subsided. I was relieved I didn&#8217;t have to make a decision about having a D&amp;C, relieved that my body could do what it had to do with little drama. I was relieved it was over.</p>\n<p>It sounds weird but I had a high &#8211; post-birth hormones are the same. Adrenaline to kick you into serious child-rearing action. Of course, there was no child. But nevertheless, I buzzed around cleaning, which is not my natural state. I spent a couple of hours sprucing up the garden, and did everything I had to do.</p>\n<p>The\u00a0obstetrician\u00a0confirmed that the miscarriage was complete, and gave me all the information about how to deal with grief, and who to refer to if things got bad. She and the midwife were very supportive.</p>\n<p>That evening, we had a burial for our little sac. I asked Elka if she would like to choose a spot, and miraculously she took us to where we buried her placenta some time ago. She wanted it buried right next to the placenta. She threw some dirt in the hole, and then picked some flowers. It was very sweet. Another opportunity to cry.</p>\n<p>A few days later, the high has faded, and I am left feeling empty, and low. I close my eyes, and I can see that black, empty space in my uterus, and that sad empty sac.</p>\n<p>In some ways, this has brought up an older grief I experienced when my best friend died tragically eight years ago. That experience has been close to my heart in these last few days. Ironically, I received a letter from her mother in the mail yesterday, which was timely and beautiful.</p>\n<p>I also miss being pregnant, both physically and emotionally. It is like my body has deflated, and I am on my own again.</p>\n<p>In another way, I am fine. Physically, everything feels normal. And I am excited to be able to drink wine again, and go to hot spas. It sounds trivial, but they are small but comforting compensations. The other beauty is that I have a whole new set of eyes for my little ray of light and joy, Elka, who has been empathetic and sweet. She has been buzzing around so joyfully. I am thrilled with her perfect innocence, and her endless fascination and curiosity with life. She makes me feel fortunate.</p>\n<p>Everyone&#8217;s experience of a miscarriage must be very different, depending on where they are in life, if it is a first pregnancy, or if they have miscarried in the past. This is my experience. I want to share my perspective on it. In the end, I am left in wonder at the body&#8217;s amazing ability to take care of itself. I wouldn&#8217;t go through it again, if I had the choice, but like most things in life, I am sure it has helped me grow as a person.</p>\n<p>* This story has been adapted from\u00a0<a title=\"International Mothers' Project\" href=\"http://www.internationalmothersproject.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.internationalmothersproject.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/dandylion.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-283\" title=\"Dandy\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/dandylion.jpg?w=250&#038;h=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "post_id": 156, "location": false, "date": "07-09-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["baby", "pregnancy", "second child", "preparing for birth", "family"], "text": "<p>The baby bomb is ticking&#8230;technically 31 days to go until it all unravels, or perhaps becomes more amazing than it already is.</p>\n<p>Here is what I have done to prepare for the inevitable:</p>\n<p>1.

Sweet little rows of onesies hanging in the sun. I have folded the clothes, and on his one day off this month, my husband built shelves for our otherwise shelve-less wardrobe. I lovingly placed piles of small clothes on the new shelves. This was a good start.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/washing.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1483\" title=\"washing\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/washing.jpg?w=480&#038;h=374\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"374\" /></a></p>\n<p>I have downloaded a hypnobirthing track, which I have listened to&#8230;once.</p>\n<p>I have done the occasional kegel exercise while brushing my teeth.</p>\n<p>And that now sums it up, a little more honestly.</p>\n<p>I think, like most things in life, we are just going to take this baby as it comes. When I was last eight months pregnant with Elka, my godmother ran from our house in a flurry to collect all things we needed and hadn&#8217;t yet done anything about (a baby bath, a change mat, bunny rugs etcetera etcetera).</p>\n<p>A friend asked me yesterday how I thought it would all go with two kids, and how Elka would transition. I told her I think it will all be fine, and I am not worried at all. It&#8217;s as true as I am unprepared. I feel that all will be fine. Perhaps I am being na\u00efve, or perhaps this is the oxytocin kicking in, which makes me hone in on all that is good, so I am inspired to keep doing this childbirth thing for the sake of the human population for the rest of my child-bearing years.</p>\n<p>My friend raised her eyebrows in dubious uncertainty. Really? She was saying with her eyebrows. Really, I said. And at the very least, if I feel positive about it all, then I give us four the best chance of rolling into expanding family life smoothly.</p>\n<p>Oh, there is one more contribution to the impending birth I have made, which is to swim twice a week. It took me until the final trimester to re-connect with the wonder that is swimming when pregnant. I slowly glide through the water, my body supported and caressed by the water. My joints soft. I close my eyes for half the lap, repeating affirmations about my baby and my birth. It is my meditation; the one time and place in our busy lives that I can truly become centred and relaxed. As I emerge from the water, I am tranquil. This, perhaps, is the best preparation of all&#8230;for the inevitable, ticking baby bomb.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1562\" style=\"width: 490px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://markjohnson.photoshelter.com/image/I00002KpiU7jbXhY\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1562\" title=\"Pregnant-woman-underwater-in-pool-PWM-1515-20100131-MarkAJohnson\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/pregnant-woman-underwater-in-pool-pwm-1515-20100131-markajohnson.jpg?w=480&#038;h=318\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"318\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a href=\"http://markjohnson.photoshelter.com/image/I00002KpiU7jbXhY\">Image source</a></p></div>\n<p>{Linking with <a href=\"http://www.withsomegrace.com/\">Grace for Flog Your Blog Friday</a>.

I have never gone out for a Valentine&#8217;s Day date. And I think my mum and dad were lucky if they received a scrappy handmade card on their respective days. There are just too many <em>days</em> that need to be celebrated. I guess our family just chose to focus on a few.</p>\n<p>Now that I have a child, though, the\u00a0<em>days</em> take on a new significance. I am jaded if I don&#8217;t get a Valentine or a Mother&#8217;s Day present. I feel it is my obligation to give my husband a present on behalf of our two-year-old to thank him for being a spectacular dad. With child comes need to celebrate, repeatedly.</p>\n<p>Typical for my husband, the father in question, he spent Father&#8217;s Day working. And so our celebratory efforts were minimised. But I did spend the day thinking about what an amazing father he is, in honour of his\u00a0<em>day.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>This is what I thought.</p>\n<p>He is kind to our daughter. I thought long and hard, and I couldn&#8217;t think of a single instance when he has been unkind to her. It is a remarkable quality in a person. Try as hard as we might to be kind to our children, occasionally we slip up and get crabby. But not my husband.</p>\n<p>He is patient. He works with people with disabilities and manages very challenging behaviours on a regular basis. He also spent eight years as a practicing Buddhist. His capacity to tolerate and to accept anything is enviable. A toddler-quake stirs not a ripple in his calm exterior. He merely sits and waits for it to pass. Kindness in his eyes.</p>\n<p>He is funny. Even after the worst day at work, he manages to come home singing silly little songs about whatnot. As I cook, I listen to the stream of giggles coming from my daughter who is in the bath, being entertained by nonsense.</p>\n<p>He is wise. So many times, my daughter has rejected his kind, gentle affection and has demanded\u00a0<em>Mummy!</em> and every time, he smiles fondly at her, with love in his heart and his eyes, and does not take it personally.\u00a0<em><br />\n</em></p>\n<p>He is the perfect father, who teaches me how to be a better mum. All good parenting suggestions came from him, initially. It was he who thought being separated from a baby who sleeps in a cot in another room was unbearable. It was he who told me not to worry about the two-hour-at-a-time sleep routine I felt I had failed to achieve.\u00a0<em>Let&#8217;s carry her in the sling</em>, he&#8217;d said,\u00a0<em>we know that works.</em> Between us, we carried our little baby all day every day until at last she was happy to nestle into a cot or a pram to sleep. It was he that brought up the issue of smacking children one evening, and said that never ever in ten thousand and one years would anyone ever smack our children. It was he who never wanted our little girl to have to fall asleep crying on her own. It was he who encouraged me to sit with patience and compassion as our tiny little soul lost her structure and melted into a wet teary puddle on the floor.</p>\n<p>Because of he, my daughter is sunshine and happiness.</p>\n<p>We always joke about how he is number three.</p>\n<p>1. Toddler, 2. Mum. 3. as an after thought, Dad.</p>\n<p>But, really 3. Dad is the structure that supports us. The glue that binds us. The joke that keeps us happy on the crappiest of days.</p>\n<p>So Greg, although we didn&#8217;t formally celebrate Father&#8217;s Day and I never got around to making pancakes, I want you to know how much we appreciate you and your amazing fathering abilities. You have given Father&#8217;s Day meaning and purpose, and have made our lives better, all at the same time.</p>\n<p>{He got teary reading this draft}</p>\n<p><strong><em>Please come\u00a0and join\u00a0my community at\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/heartmamaxx\">Heart Mama</a>\u00a0on Facebook.</em></strong></p>\n<p>{Linking with <a href=\"http://www.diaryofasahm.net/\">Jess at Diary of a SAHM</a> for I Blog on Tuesday.

A beautiful girl my age, so intelligent and creative and inspiring. Her life was so filled with pain, though, and I suppose on that day, there seemed to be only one answer.</p>\n<p><em>One day is all it takes.</em></p>\n<p>I have spent the last few months working for Lifeline as a telephone crisis support person. I took many suicide calls &#8211; people at the brink of despair, clinging on to life, and calling the only number they had at hand. Thank goodness they reached out.</p>\n<p><em>Sometimes a conversation is all it takes.</em></p>\n<p>I have trodden that worn track. The track of despair. I spent years 12 to 22 in bouts of misery and desperation. I struggled with a messy mind, harsh thoughts about myself and deep, empty moods. These moods and these thoughts chased me and hounded me. But I was good at expressing myself, so I emptied buckets of these thoughts and mood eclipses into diaries and conversations with my mum, who was always available to listen.</p>\n<p>After taking antidepressants for a year or so, seeking counselling and doing meditation, my inner self mended and I was at last whole in myself. I enjoyed a sunny day. I laughed genuinely with friends. I could love myself. The constant negative whir of thoughts was finally silenced. I could hear myself think.</p>\n<p>When I was pregnant with Elka, I worried about my past tendencies and where my mind would take me. I knew that I was at risk of developing postnatal depression. So I surrounded myself with support and nourishment. I was careful never to feel depleted. I walked daily. I slept when I could. I made an effort to connect with other parents. When I struggled, I asked for help. Thankfully, I didn&#8217;t experience PND.</p>\n<p><em>Not everyone is so lucky.</em></p>\n<p>Postnatal depression affects one in seven women following the birth of a child. Forty percent of these women begin to experience symptoms in pregnancy. Postnatal depression describes the prolonged and severe symptoms of depression that last longer than a week or two and affect normal functioning. It is very real, and affects many.</p>\n<p>There is no specific recipe for developing PND. Risk factors include a history of depression, stressful life events, a baby that is difficult to settle, personality factors, like anxiety and insufficient support networks. Symptoms include loss of enjoyment in things, low self-esteem, a sense of hopelessness&#8230;a wish to die.</p>\n<p>Sometimes the symptoms can be disguised. Some women are fearful of being detected. Being found to be a bad mother. An unhappy mother. Guilt interweaves with sadness, melancholy and stress. The effect can be devastating.</p>\n<p><em>You may not know somebody is struggling, until you ask.</em></p>\n<p>Thankfully, we live in an age when people are talking about PND. They are also beginning to talk about men who experience PND. Social networks are forming; awareness is being raised; there are many <a href=\"http://www.netmums.com/coffeehouse/advice-support-40/pnd-support-55/\">on-line forums</a> for people who experience PND symptoms. \u00a0<a href=\"http://www.panda.org.au/\">PANDA</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.blackdoginstitute.org.au\">Blackdog Institute</a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.beyondblue.org.au\">Beyond Blue </a>\u00a0are three prominent organisations in Australia, which are striving to educate people about PND and offer guidance and support.\u00a0Campaigns like RU OK are asking the question.</p>\n<p>There is no one solution. There are options, though, and support is available. Parents don&#8217;t need to suffer in isolation. They don&#8217;t need to reach the brink of despair. When we ask\u00a0<em>Ask you OK?\u00a0</em>we are reaching out to those who need our support. Perhaps it is the branch they need.</p>\n<p>For <a href=\"http://www.ruokday.com/about-r-u-ok-day/\">RU OK Day</a> this Thursday, please ask,\u00a0<em>Are you OK?\u00a0</em>Let&#8217;s offer support to those who are struggling.

But I am way too edgy&#8230;like a racehorse ready to race, I wake in the morning, make my cup of tea, and from there it&#8217;s go go go. I have various projects in motion, and relish the opportunity to be able to sit down at a computer for 10 minutes to nut away at one. When Elka was first born, I sat on the gym ball with her in the hug-a-bub and wrote a manual on Foot Skin and Nail Care for TAFE (yes, I am an expert in that field, apparently!) And the rest of the time, I was walking into town to see Greg, or visiting a friend, or going to my mum&#8217;s group, or going to the beach, or driving to see my mum, etc etc etc. I think my average was one whole day at home a fortnight, and that is probably a generous average.</p>\n<p>The other thing, and I have mentioned this before, is that I don&#8217;t like cleaning. Who does, I suppose. But I am generally unbothered by mess, which clean people generally aren&#8217;t. My grandmother, my mother, my mother-in-law, my adopted Spanish grandma&#8230;these ladies know how to keep a house clean. And me&#8230;as hard as I try (not very hard), it just never seems to stay tidy.</p>\n<p>But apparently, all this was the <em>old </em>me. The new me is wearing an apron, washing up directly after every meal, sweeping the floor twice a day, carpet sweeping at least once, putting on a load of washing first thing in the morning, folding and putting it away before bed&#8230;Greg still does the cooking because he enjoys it so much, but seriously, I think I am developing the clean gene! And not only that, I am developing the wonderful capacity to be able to stay at home all (ok, most) of the day with my darling daughter and enjoy every minute. Yes, I have the occasional peak at Facebook on the Blackberry, but mostly my little girl is entertainment enough! Actually, the trick is, just getting on and doing things. Like this morning, when I first woke up, after my cup of tea, I made Elka a sweet little fabric hat. She has reached the wonderful age of being able to sit and play on her own, so happily, for a long time. She tootles around with dollies and books and fake phones. Occasionally she comes to see what I am doing, but then goes back to her little world. Frankly, I love it. I love the little creative world she is inventing, and I love the freedom we both have.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_167\" style=\"width: 267px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/hat.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-167\" title=\"Summer hat\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/hat.jpg?w=257&#038;h=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"257\" height=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Hat</p></div>\n<p>I diverge slightly here from the original topic, to tell you about a day on the beach with a friend and her child. My friend played with great enthusiasm with her gorgeous boy all afternoon &#8211; stimulating his imagination and his play with wonderful little stories and images. I stood by Elka, feet in the water, while she played in the sand. I just let her go, and she seemed happy enough. It&#8217;s hard to say if there is a right or wrong way of doing things, but I definitely recognised my mother and my grandmother in me that afternoon. The type to stand aside, as the children play and invent a world of their own. As a child, I spent hours sitting in the hollow of a giant olive tree at the base of our property where the king and the family of bears and others lived. Of my early childhood memories, I can only remember the ones where I played alone in my imaginary world. Some parents are highly stimulating, and some are are less so. I am certainly the latter. Whilst I love sitting down with Elka for some quality time in the garden or with a book, I sleep next to her every night, and I sit with her for every meal, I also love the space we both have to do our own thing.</p>\n<p>So the crux is, my inner housewife has found her groove. I can happily spend a lot of time at home these days. There is no urgency to jet out and stay busy. And the other fabulous outcome is that on the whole, my house is pretty tidy. And strangely I am wishing more and more for it to stay that way.</p>\n", "post_id": 163, "location": false, "date": "07-12-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["winnie the pooh", "philosophy", "imagination", "books", "Enchanted Place", "A.A.

Not even when I am a hundred.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Pooh thought for a little.</p>\n<p>&#8220;How old shall I be then?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Ninety-nine.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Pooh nodded.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I promise,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Still with his eyes on the world Christopher Robin put out a hand and felt for Pooh&#8217;s paw.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Pooh,&#8221; said Christopher Robin earnestly, &#8220;if I &#8211; if I&#8217;m not quite &#8211; &#8221; he stopped and tried again &#8211; &#8220;Pooh,\u00a0<em>whatever\u00a0</em>happens, you\u00a0<em>will\u00a0</em>understand, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Understand what?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Oh, nothing.&#8221; He laughed and jumped to his feet. &#8220;Come on!&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; said Pooh.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Anywhere,&#8221; said Christopher Robin.</p>\n<p>So they went off together. But wherever they go, and whatever happens to them on the way, in that enchanted place on the top of the Forest a little boy and his Bear will always be playing.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">* \u00a0 * \u00a0 *</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I don&#8217;t know why&#8230;pregnancy hormones, perhaps&#8230;but reading this chapter, the final chapter in the collection of Pooh stories, to Elka the other night, I began to cry. My chest constricted, and as I read, I fought back the tears, until I couldn&#8217;t contain them and I was sobbing like I haven&#8217;t sobbed in years. Elka sat closer, one hand on my arm, her big brown eyes focused on me intently. \u00a0<em>Mama, are you OK?</em> she asked.\u00a0<em>Do you need Dew Tea* to make you feel better?</em> I couldn&#8217;t stop. She, Pooh, Christopher Robin, the book, everything. I couldn&#8217;t stop.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">What was it, other than the pregnancy hormones that made me cry so?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I have been thinking about it ever since.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Perhaps is was just the pregnancy hormones.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">But perhaps, it was the end of Winnie-the-Pooh &amp; The House at Pooh Corner, only my favourite storybook ever written. I had never read this far into the collection of Pooh stories, so perhaps I was taken aback that it actually\u00a0<em>did\u00a0</em>end at some point&#8230;that those stories didn&#8217;t somehow miraculously continue into infinity, like I somehow imagined they would. All things, even the best thing, must end. Maybe this is why I couldn&#8217;t hold back tears.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Perhaps it was because every time the relationship between Christopher Robin and Winnie the Pooh is referred to, I well up. To me, their friendship and their love for each other is so perfect. <em>Well, you laughed to yourself, &#8220;Silly old Bear!&#8221; but you didn&#8217;t say it aloud because you were so fond of him, and you went home for your umbrella.</em> Their friendship is built on trust and respect. On affection. On warmth. Maybe this is why I cried.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Perhaps it was because, behind the words of this final Pooh Bear chapter, lies a metaphor. A metaphor that represents ageing, and the leaving behind of childhood. The fact that imagination and childish dreams and the desire to do Nothing can&#8217;t continue forever, and we must all at some point enter the land of Reality. It is only on visiting our Enchanted Place that we can return to our childhood imaginations, like visiting an old friend for a cup of tea and realising that your friendship will never be as it was when you were young. \u00a0Maybe I cried because, at some point, we all have to grow up.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Or, perhaps it was just the pregnancy hormones.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em>Am I the only one in the world who loves Winnie the Pooh this much?

Show them the way that you feel.</em></strong></p>\n<p>I wrote these James Taylor lyrics in one of my pensive teen journals. It made sense. If you feel it, express it. Share the love.</p>\n<p>A close friend and I sat huddled over cups of tea at the market this morning, while Elka was occupied with a baby cino. We talked about love. Her words were:</p>\n<p><em>If you can think of nothing else to do with your life, love someone and be loved.</em></p>\n<p>My friend and I shared a common experience growing up. Although we both knew that we were loved by our families, in theory, neither of us could remember a time we were showered in love. Told we were beautiful. Made to feel fabulous. Perhaps our families were limited by the lack of affection and love they experienced as children. Maybe affection was tapped because of a cultural belief that showering a child in love makes a child full of him or herself. If you shower in love, your child might love themselves too much, and that would not be good by any acceptable Australian standard.</p>\n<p>In my family, affection is hard to come by. We aren&#8217;t the lovey-dovey types. We express love in gruff tones and in symbolic actions, like turning up for Christmas dinner, or huddling around the flat screen TV watching the rugby. Pass the nuts. We all know this is love. But no-one will ever say it.</p>\n<p>And it runs down the generations. My grandma, a matriarch and a passionate chatter-box, loved all her children and grandchildren greatly. We knew, because she cried every time we sent her a letter or won an award, and she wrote <em>I love you so very much\u00a0</em>in giant cursive \u00a0in our birthday cards. But she couldn&#8217;t help making dismissive remarks, designed to keep the lid on self-esteem. A few years ago, I painted a self-portrait, one I was particularly proud of and gave it to her, thinking that she would love it, just because I painted it. She barely acknowledged it, except to say it didn&#8217;t much look like me. A few weeks later, I saw it at my mother&#8217;s house, on top of the piano. My grandma has quietly palmed it off.</p>\n<p>Although I am naturally inclined towards being affectionate and loving, I still struggle at times with my genetic slash conditioned programming. For instance, when I first met my husband, I told him he wasn&#8217;t a great singer and he was nice looking, but not drop dead gorgeous &#8211; fictions he had somehow gone thirty years believing. Thankfully, he had thirty years prior to meeting me to build a self-esteem of iron and steel, which was reinforced continuously by people around him.</p>\n<p>I feel that, at last, with my daughter, the cycle is broken. She is endlessly loving. Affectionate. She looks at us with certainty in her big brown eyes. She knows we love her. We say it a million times a day. And she says it back.\u00a0<em>Mama, I love you soooo much.</em> I am not worried about her self-esteem being inflated. All I want is for her to know that she is loved. That she is utterly loveable. And for this to be the platform from which she explores her own life, finds her own personality and makes her own choices.</p>\n<p>Isn&#8217;t this every parent&#8217;s dream? To nourish little hearts with love, tenderness and sunshine?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong><em>Please join me at the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/heartmamaxx\">Heart Mama</a>\u00a0community on Facebook.</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">{linking with A Mama&#8217;s Story for <a href=\"http://amamastory.blogspot.com.au/\">Mama Moments Mondays</a>\u00a0&amp; A Twinkle in the Eye for <a href=\"http://www.twinkleintheeyeblog.com/\">Flash Friday</a>}</p>\n", "post_id": 1648, "location": false, "date": "09-16-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/inevitable.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image aligncenter\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/inevitable.jpg?w=470\" alt=\"Image\" /></a></p>\n<p>The inevitable is soon to occur.

She carried the little bundle in her Ergo, a broad-brimmed hat shaded her smiling face and her baby&#8217;s delicate head.</p>\n<p>After exchanging a few pleasantries, we reached the sleep issue. And if you have ever had a six month old baby, or a twelve month old baby or any baby for that matter, it is likely that, when bumping into a friend who also has a baby, you will\u00a0veer towards the topic of sleep eventually.</p>\n<p>She told me how she had been to the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.tresillian.net/\">Tresillian Family Care Centre</a>\u00a0to resolve all her sleeping issues, and stood by,\u00a0dis-empowered\u00a0and appalled as a well-intentioned support person rocked her baby furiously to nursery rhymes, that blared from a TV in the room. Her baby screamed, tears rolling down its red cheeks. The well-intentioned support person continued to rock with vigour. Sleep was not achieved.</p>\n<p>She put her exhausted baby in the Ergo, and walked away.</p>\n<p>I have been there too. The same centre. The same experience. Like my friend, I was desperately seeking a solution for getting my baby to sleep. I had read in books that babies need to nap constantly, and stay asleep for two hours minimum to develop properly. My baby slept 20 minutes; 40 minutes tops. I had visions of her little brain disintegrating with lack of proper sleep. Her howls confirmed my irrational belief. My baby couldn&#8217;t sleep, and was damaging herself. I had to take control of the situation and change it.</p>\n<p>My husband kindly supported my decisions; he reserved his own judgement and feelings because he trusted my role as mother. But when I left the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.tresillian.net/\">Tresillian centre</a>, defeated, fearful, he reassured me.\u00a0<em>Don&#8217;t worry about it. We&#8217;ll just carry her. She sleeps that way.</em></p>\n<p>And so we tucked her away in the sling, and she happily slept. 20 minutes; 40 minutes tops. I talked to other people, and was constantly reassured that this was\u00a0<em>normal</em>. Some babies can do a marathon. Others sleep in sprints. We had a sprinter.</p>\n<p>On accepting the Way Things Were, I relaxed into my role as a mother, and life became easier. At night, I would rock our darling for what seemed like hours, her head resting in the crook of my elbow, singing\u00a0<em>Hallelujah</em>\u00a0for the sixteenth time in a row. During the day, I marched the hills of Lismore in the summer heat, wearing the sling. I didn&#8217;t dread it. It just was what it was.</p>\n<p>The day sleeps continued as such until recently &#8211; with my ever-growing mound, I had to at last abandon the sling, and Elka happily decided never to day-sleep again.</p>\n<p>At night, I went from rocking to breastfeeding at night. The distant echo of Tizzy Hall and other such sleep gurus rang in my ears &#8211;\u00a0<em>You are making it harder for your baby to sleep because you are giving her a sleep aid. She will never be able to learn to sleep on her own if you continue. Babies need to be taught how to sleep unaided.\u00a0</em>But in my laziness, I continued. Breastfeeding to sleep was\u00a0<em>easy</em>. More than that, it was enjoyable. I was relaxed, because of happy oxytocin hormones, and Elka was happy, because of my magic breast milk.</p>\n<p>When I gave up breastfeeding after 15 months, I worried about how to get Elka to sleep,\u00a0<em>unaided</em>. After all, she is a very strong-willed character, and doesn&#8217;t accept &#8216;no&#8217; easily. But, it was easy. I just lay with her, whispering stories about rainbows and cloud fairies. She fell asleep, her hand on my face. The first night she woke a couple of times. The next she woke once, and fell straight back asleep. The third she slept right through. She has done so ever since.</p>\n<p>Recently, a research article was published in the APP&#8217;s journal Pediatrics, which presented findings that no long-term damage was found following sleep training. The article was picked up and circulated widely, validating the popular sleep training methods that are used and advocated by many parents and professionals.</p>\n<p>However, the findings of the research are not conclusive. Author\u00a0<a href=\"http://babycalm.wordpress.com/2012/09/11/breaking-news-sleep-training-babies-is-safe-and-causes-no-lasting-damage-really/\">Sarah Ockwell-Smith</a>\u00a0lists serious methodology issues, and questions that haven&#8217;t been answered by the study. For instance, sleep problems were parent reported, and the sleep problems were undefined. How do you quantify a sleep problem? What is a problem for one person, may not be a problem for the next. The research sample was selected by the researchers. Also, the sample who were in the sleep training group had to be OK with sleep training techniques being used &#8211; this fact alone may reflect other parenting choices, and would have impacted parents&#8217; responses when self-reporting on the results of the training. Sarah also questions why cortisol levels were tested when the child was six, and not at the time of sleep training.</p>\n<p>People are talking about sleep training, and it&#8217;s an important topic.</p>\n<p>My view and experience is that although sleep training methods are popular, and widely used, they do not suit every baby and every parent. When she was an infant, we couldn&#8217;t close the door on our child when she cried out for us. We wanted her to know we were there, and that her cries were heard. We didn&#8217;t want her to give up. To feel defeated. We wanted her to know that\u00a0<a href=\"http://heartmama.net/2012/09/06/in-you-i-trust/\">she could trust us, and trust the world</a>.</p>\n<p>The sleep issue was so hard at times, especially as the responsibility fell mainly on my shoulders. Some nights I lay there with my daughter, crying on the inside. Why me? Why so long? Why can&#8217;t she just Go To Sleep?</p>\n<p>But like all things in life, her sleep patterns changed. Now, as a toddler, she is a dream. At seven, she goes to bed. I lie with her for about five minutes, and she is fast asleep. I creep away. She sleeps all night long, and wakes up beside us the next morning with scruffy hair and a big smile.</p>\n<p><em>At the time, it seemed like forever, but really it went by so fast</em>.</p>\n<p>By allowing my daughter to find her own sleep niche without training has given me the gift of patience, a toddler who sleeps beautifully and long, relaxing cuddles in the dark. I cherish the time I spend with her, as we lie together. And I am grateful that although she wasn&#8217;t a dream sleeper as a baby, I was able to open up my heart and allow her to change me, rather than the other way around.</p>\n<p>Babies don&#8217;t necessarily sleep easily. But I don&#8217;t think they should be forced to. I don&#8217;t accept the common belief that babies need to be taught how to sleep. I think they will learn in their own time. By adjusting our own expectations, relinquishing control, and with patience, sleep will, at last be achieved.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong><em>Please join me at the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/heartmamaxx\">Heart Mama</a>\u00a0community on Facebook.</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">{linking with Grace for <a href=\"http://www.withsomegrace.com/\">Flog Your Blog Friday</a>.}</p>\n", "post_id": 1674, "location": false, "date": "09-19-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["interview", "awake parenting", "blogging", "awesomely awake"], "text": "<p>I am honoured to have been interviewed by Shawn at the wonderful and inspiring <a href=\"http://awesomelyawake.com/meet-awake-zanni/\">Awesomely Awake</a>, as part of the Awake Series.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A taster&#8230;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://awesomelyawake.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/zanniandelka.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" title=\"zanniandelka\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/awesomelyawake.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/zanniandelka.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"545\" height=\"369\" /></a></p>\n<p><em>I am pleased to introduce Zanni from\u00a0<a href=\"http://heartmama.net/\">Heart Mama</a>\u00a0today.

If I don&#8217;t write this now, I may miss my chance.</p>\n<p>Our world is about to change.</p>\n<p>Your Daddy, you and I have been together for nearly three years, sleeping side by side, playing together, eating together, growing together. Your little smile, your laughter, your hugs, the jokes you make and the stories you tell have filled us with great love and happiness. It is a wonder to watch you grow into the little person you are. Kind and generous to your friends. Spirited. Happy.</p>\n<p>I imagine&#8230;I hope&#8230; all these things won&#8217;t change.</p>\n<p>What will change is we will go from three to four, though you have known that for a long time. Eight months ago, you put your little hand on my belly and asked if there was a baby inside. There was.</p>\n<p>Every morning, you lift up my shirt and talk to the baby.</p>\n<p>You tell everyone you meet that you think it&#8217;s a girl.</p>\n<p>You lay me on the couch to &#8220;check the baby&#8221;, your little hand held in a fist, you dab it in your pretend gel, and roll it around my tummy.\u00a0<em>I can hear the heart beat</em>, you tell me.\u00a0<em>It sounds like bubbles.</em></p>\n<p>We have watched birth movies together and read children&#8217;s books about babies being born. As the baby is born, I begin to cry, and you snuggle next to me, excited and in awe. <em>The baby is coming out,\u00a0</em>you say.</p>\n<p>I hope you will be there for the birth of our baby. But maybe you will be asleep, and we won&#8217;t want to wake you. If you do awake, and there is a new little person in your life, I hope you won&#8217;t be too surprised. Although something tells me that whatever the circumstances, you will adjust easily, as you have to every other change that has happened.</p>\n<p>Something tells me that you will be a beautiful big sister &#8211; caring, loving, generous &#8211; like you are with every other person in your life. Maybe it will be a change so big it is difficult to accept at first, but I hope we can help you through the transition, holding your little hand.</p>\n<p>In our last few days (few weeks) together, just us, I want to thank you for being the beautiful spirit you are. For filling my life with sunshine. For making me feel complete. You have made motherhood easy for me. You have made me a better person. And as our lives become richer with the arrival of the fourth family member, I know you will continue to.</p>\n<p>I will embrace these days with you, my first and beautiful child, and hold them close to my heart.</p>\n<p>Love, Mama.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong><em>Please join me at the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/heartmamaxx\">Heart Mama</a>\u00a0community on Facebook.</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">{Inspired by\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.raising-humans.com/2012/08/11/remember-this-time/#more-\">Raising Humans.</a>\u00a0Linking with Jess from <a href=\"http://www.diaryofasahm.net/\">Diary of a SAHM for IBOT</a>}</p>\n", "post_id": 1685, "location": false, "date": "09-24-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Sleepy Turtle Photography", "Lennox Head", "photography", "motherhood", "pregnancy", "Lake Ainsworth"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://sleepyturtle.com.au/\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1695\" title=\"sleepy turtle photography\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_5534.jpg?w=480&#038;h=320\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"320\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://sleepyturtle.com.au/\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1700\" title=\"http://sleepyturtle.com.au/\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_5527.jpg?w=480&#038;h=320\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"320\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://sleepyturtle.com.au/\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1701\" title=\"http://sleepyturtle.com.au/\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_5541.jpg?w=480&#038;h=371\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"371\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://sleepyturtle.com.au/\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1699\" title=\"http://sleepyturtle.com.au/\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_5523.jpg?w=480&#038;h=320\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"320\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://sleepyturtle.com.au/\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1698\" title=\"http://sleepyturtle.com.au/\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_5455.jpg?w=480&#038;h=320\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"320\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://sleepyturtle.com.au/\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1697\" title=\"http://sleepyturtle.com.au/\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_5448.jpg?w=480&#038;h=342\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"342\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://sleepyturtle.com.au/\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1696\" title=\"http://sleepyturtle.com.au/\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_5381.jpg?w=480&#038;h=320\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"320\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Pregnancy portraits taken by Kate Farrell from <a href=\"http://sleepyturtle.com.au/\">Sleepy Turtle Photography</a> at Lake Ainsworth, Lennox Head.</p>\n<p>Linking with <a href=\"http://withsomegrace.com\">With Some Grace</a></p>\n", "post_id": 1694, "location": false, "date": "09-27-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["spa", "family", "relaxation"], "text": "<p>After a day at <a title=\"Kiva Spa\" href=\"http://www.thekivaspa.com/\">Kiva Spa</a> in Mullumbimby with dear friends, I am brimming full of stories and ideas&#8230;I just don&#8217;t know where to start! Maybe I should begin with how great it is to be pampered when you are a mother. Husbands, partners, friends, parents and especially babies&#8230;please note: mummies LOVE to be looked after!</p>\n<p>Despite being married to a massage therapist, I think it&#8217;s been nearly two years since my last full body massage treatment. It&#8217;s not something I would usually tend to indulge in&#8230;the greatest indulgence I have had in the last couple of years has been a good haircut. And when that very handsome (gay) hairdresser ran his fingers through my hair, wow, that felt good!</p>\n<p>But lying there today, in a room that smelt like a temple to aromatherapy, I think I melted into heaven. It felt divine. Every muscle that had not previously been tenderised by the sauna/spa treatment released, and I was left as a gooey puddle on the massage table. I can still smell the oil on my hands and in my hair, and I am taken back to that delightful, relaxing haven.</p>\n<p>Just imagine for a moment if every mother had the opportunity to be pampered as such on a regular &#8211; let&#8217;s say <em>weekly</em> &#8211; basis. The partners could look after the children, and hang out together, getting to know one another, and the mothers could be transcended from daily domestic duties to heavenly bliss. We would collectively be a happier and more together lot. We would sleep better, be kinder to our better halves and more patient with our children. We would not snap at the lady at the bakery, who short changed us, or roll our eyes at the woman behind us with the screaming child. We would be vessels of love &#8211; openly accepting the world. Kind &amp; nurturing. We would be awesome&#8230;even more awesome than we already are.</p>\n<p>Ahhh, well it was a nice day dream while it lasted. And in the meantime, I will just smell the oil on my hands and be transported back to that Balinese garden in the middle of Mullumbimby where for a few hours, I felt a bit more like a human being.</p>\n", "post_id": 170, "location": false, "date": "07-14-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["kindness", "family", "nourishing", "parenting", "self esteem", "inspirational", "self compassion", "self love"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://pinterest.com/starlycarly/\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1706\" title=\"hug\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/hug.jpg?w=480&#038;h=642\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"642\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em>Self compassion. Self love. Friend to self.</em></p>\n<p>When I was growing up, and Becoming Adult, the thing which was emphasised was self-esteem &#8211; perceiving yourself in a positive way. Cultivate self-esteem. Nurture self-esteem. Know that you are a good person and you can be successful. Our parents read books on the stuff, and we were encouraged to believe we could be the best person we could be.</p>\n<p>Lately, I have been thinking about self-love, instead of self-esteem. How you perceive yourself is important. But how your treat yourself and how you talk to yourself will directly affect your experience of the world.</p>\n<p><em>How do you talk to yourself?</em></p>\n<p>If you have ever watched a Woody Allen film, like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBzHphcc2Jw\">Annie Hall</a>, you will remember the endless mind chatter that goes on in the main character&#8217;s head. Negative verbal\u00a0diarrhoea. Many of us have it. I am not good enough. I am a failure. I am not worthy of love. I did something wrong. I upset someone&#8230;</p>\n<p>Until recent years, my mind was a train park of irrational, destructive thoughts. All About Me. I suck. I am not worthy. Nobody loves me. The chatter was relentless. Some days I would slap the sides of my head to make it go away.</p>\n<p><em>I was no friend to me.</em></p>\n<p>I read an article this week in <a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/sciammind/\">Scientific American Mind</a> about self compassion. The article talks about the importance of self-compassion&#8230;for health, longevity, for surviving hardships and dealing with crises. Self compassion is self-love. It is treating yourself as you would a friend.</p>\n<p>How do you treat your friends? Do you tell them they suck? They are failures? They are not worthy of love? That nobody loves them?</p>\n<p>No&#8230;I didn&#8217;t think so. I can&#8217;t imagine anyone who reads this blog saying this to someone they know. And yet so many of us say these things to ourselves.</p>\n<p>We also say: I am a bad mother. I am horrible to my children. I am a bad wife or a bad partner. Again, these a things we wouldn&#8217;t say to our friends. We wouldn&#8217;t think them.</p>\n<p>I believe that self compassion is the road to love. If we practice talking to ourselves with kindness and love, we will turn that love and kindness to others. Our husbands, our partners, our children, our friends, our family.</p>\n<p>It works both ways. If we talk kindly to others &#8211; our children, our partners, our friends and family &#8211; we feel good in ourselves and our kindness is internalised. We feel kind towards ourselves.</p>\n<p>Self compassion and self nourishment isn&#8217;t necessarily about getting a massage or a pedicure, although these things may help. We can nourish ourselves simply by accepting who we are. Taking the reins off, and giving ourselves a break. We can sit down with ourselves, have a cup of tea, hear about our day, and feel warmth towards ourselves&#8230;in the way we do with a friend.</p>\n<p>I hope all of you beautiful mamas and readers of this blog will find it in your hearts to be kind to yourselves. Befriend yourselves. Give yourselves a hug.</p>\n<p>Nourishing You is the beginning of nourishing your children. Here at <a href=\"http://heartmama.net\">Heart Mama</a>, I hope for children around the world to be nourished with love, tenderness and sunshine. Hugging yourself is a great place to start.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em><strong>Please join me at the <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/heartmamaxx\">Heart Mama community on Facebook.</a></strong></em><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/heartmamaxx\">\u00a0</a></p>\n", "post_id": 1705, "location": false, "date": "10-01-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["pregnancy", "anticipation", "labour", "birth"], "text": "<div style=\"padding-bottom:2px;line-height:0;\"><a href=\"http://pinterest.com/pin/148196643958546136/\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" style=\"border:0;\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/media-cache-ec6.pinterest.com/upload/148196643958546136_6gJeZcZL_c.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"326\" border=\"0\" /></a></div>\n<div style=\"float:left;padding-top:0;padding-bottom:0;\">\n<p style=\"font-size:10px;color:#76838b;\">\n</div>\n<p>It is full moon and the barometric pressure is rising.

I can&#8217;t wait for that first, heavy contraction &#8211; that bite that will contort my body and tell me it&#8217;s all on.

There was a power in the air. All I could do is stare at the trees against the grey sky and stroke Elka&#8217;s forehead. My uterus was contracting. My body was preparing itself.

To torture heavily pregnant women?</p>\n<p>Is it genetics, or just my shape? Somehow, my babies like to over-cook, and I am left peddling in purgatory &#8211; so large I can barely walk, with hips and groin ligaments in absolute pain every time I stand up or lie down.</p>\n<p>Granted, I am only four days over, but I am dreading waiting the full 14 days, which Elka made me wait. Shall I have to be so patient? Or can I descend into a state of self-pity, as I hide myself away from persistent questions, like &#8220;When are you due?&#8221; or &#8220;Has the baby come yet?&#8221; or &#8220;How are the contractions going?&#8221;. Believe me, you will know when it happens, and in the mean time I will continue to wait&#8230;ahem&#8230;patiently.</p>\n<p>This period in waiting does teach me a thing or two about life.</p>\n<p>I am learning that it is human nature to want to control a situation.</p>\n<p>For instance, since Sunday night, I have eaten two large pineapples, three hot curries and one bar of chilli dark chocolate. I have had three hot baths. My husband has massaged the critical &#8220;inducing labour&#8221; points. I have walked daily. I have had a sweep. I have visualised. I feel like I have done everything.</p>\n<p>Why do I feel the need to <em>do</em>&#8230;to control the uncontrollable? When the baby is ready, he or she will release the hormone which stimulates the cervix to open. If the time isn&#8217;t right, mountains of pineapple, hot curry and acupuncture every day will make no difference.</p>\n<p>I can&#8217;t control the uncontrollable, as much as I believe I can. I just have to wait.</p>\n<p>I have also been thinking about our tendency to link unrelated events.</p>\n<p>For instance, yesterday afternoon, I scrubbed the letterbox. It was covered in bird poo and cobwebs. I had already cleaned the kitchen, the laundry, the bathroom, sorted clothes cupboards and set up the baby equipment. But until yesterday, I had neglected that vital object at the front entrance. The letterbox.</p>\n<p>Somehow, I believed that maybe the baby has been waiting for me to clean the letterbox.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Greg was in the supermarket choosing chocolate. His decision was based on what he thought might affect the arrival of baby. He chose orange dark chocolate (not sure what this means, exactly).</p>\n<p>Neither orange dark chocolate or a clean letterbox were enough to convince this baby to enter the world. Who knows, maybe these events are completely unrelated.</p>\n<p>The third thing I have learnt is that I am not a patient person. I want this baby to come now, and refuse to accept that it may still arrive on the 14th of October. That is too far away, and I will do everything I can to prevent this occurrence from happening.</p>\n<p>When I am lying awake in the middle of the night, I try and get myself back to sleep. I count sheep. I let go of each thought as it arises. I visualise myself falling back into slumber. But the only thing that actually\u00a0<em>works</em> is the thought that comes to me at some point during my\u00a0insomniac\u00a0state&#8230;<em>It doesn&#8217;t matter. I will fall asleep eventually. Just don&#8217;t worry about it.\u00a0</em>At once, I fall asleep.</p>\n<p>Perhaps, in my period of not-so-patiently waiting &#8211; this purgatory between no baby and baby &#8211; I should apply the same tactic. This is, after all, something I can\u00a0<em>do.</em></p>\n<p>And so&#8230;<em>It doesn&#8217;t matter. I will have this baby eventually. Just don&#8217;t worry about it.<br />\n</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em><strong>Please join me at the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/heartmamaxx\">Heart Mama community on Facebook.</a></strong></em></p>\n<p>{flogging with <a href=\"http://www.withsomegrace.com/\">Grace</a> this Friday}</p>\n", "post_id": 1713, "location": false, "date": "10-04-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["mothering", "newborn", "parenting", "doubt", "guest post", "fear"], "text": "<p><em>Due to the arrival of my beloved second daughter, Eve Rose, I have extended an invitation to a few bloggers to guest post on Heart Mama over the coming few weeks, while I immerse myself in the baby moon.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>This morning, I would like to introduce, Kylie Purtell from <a href=\"http://www.kyliepurtell.com/\">A Study in Contradictions.\u00a0</a>Kylie is the mother of Mia, and writes about her motherhood experiences on her blog.

As any new Mum can attest, nothing can quite prepare you for the rollercoaster of emotions and worry that you&#8217;ll suddenly find yourself on in those first few days, weeks and months.</p>\n<p>While I was incredibly in love with baby girl I was also incredibly scared of her. Well, not\u00a0<em>of</em>\u00a0her, scared\u00a0<em>for</em>\u00a0her, I guess you could say. Being the oldest of 5, and having friends with babies, I had a slight idea of what to do when it came to the basics of looking after a baby.</p>\n<p>Regardless, I still second-guessed everything I was doing. I had doubts, lots of doubts, about the best way to care for this helpless little creature, about the right and wrong way to do things. Doubts about breastfeeding, doubts about sleeping, doubts about friends and relatives holding my baby for too long. I even had doubts about my doubts.</p>\n<p>Being a bit of a control freak, and liking to know exactly what I am doing, I searched everywhere for answers. In books. Online. From my Mum, family, and friends. I don&#8217;t have to tell you that everyone has an opinion on the best way to do things with a baby. The internet is a murky pit of contradictions and conflicting advice, and at 2 in the morning, when your baby is screaming and won&#8217;t feed properly, and you feel like you&#8217;re world is going to end, reading all of that advice only makes things seem that much worse.</p>\n<p>If there is one thing I have learned in the last 11 months since becoming a Mum, it&#8217;s to trust my instincts. To do what works for Mia and myself, and not worry about what everyone else in the world is doing or thinks. I&#8217;ve learned not to worry about spoiling her, or setting up bad habits. If I could have that time with Mia again I wouldn&#8217;t bother looking on the internet for different ways to get a baby to sleep, or to check if she should really be feeding every hour. Now that I know how quickly those first few months would go, I&#8217;d just concentrate on soaking up every moment with my tiny, newborn baby. I&#8217;d cuddle her and hold her as much as I want, feed her whenever she wants, lie down and have a nap together on the bed.</p>\n<p>I hope I can remember this when it comes time to have a second baby. I hope I remember that the newborn stage is exactly that, a stage, one that passes all too quickly, and that, despite the sleepless nights and worries about feeding and everything else, this stage will pass in a heartbeat. I hope I remember to trust my instincts, to not worry about what everyone else thinks is the right thing to do, and to do what&#8217;s best for myself and my baby. Because as long as there&#8217;s love, it will always work out in the end.</p>\n<p>Kylie from <a href=\"http://www.kyliepurtell.com\">A Study in Contradictions</a>.</p>\n<p>{Linking up with Jess from <a href=\"http://www.diaryofasahm.net\">Diary of a SAHM</a> for IBOT}</p>\n", "post_id": 1719, "location": false, "date": "10-09-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em><strong>Welcome Eve Rose.</strong></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em><strong>Born 9.14pm on Sunday.</strong></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/eve.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1723\" title=\"eve\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/eve.jpg?w=480&#038;h=480\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 1722, "location": false, "date": "10-09-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["photography", "children", "birth", "family"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_2003-1.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1729\" title=\"IMG_2003.1\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_2003-1.jpg?w=480&#038;h=320\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"320\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_1997.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1728\" title=\"IMG_1997\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_1997.jpg?w=480&#038;h=320\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"320\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_2012.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1730\" title=\"IMG_2012\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_2012.jpg?w=480&#038;h=320\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"320\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_2031.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1731\" title=\"IMG_2031\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_2031.jpg?w=480&#038;h=320\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"320\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_2039.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1732\" title=\"IMG_2039\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_2039.jpg?w=480&#038;h=320\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"320\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_2046.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1734\" title=\"IMG_2046\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_2046.jpg?w=480&#038;h=320\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"320\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_2047.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1744\" title=\"IMG_2047\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_2047.jpg?w=480&#038;h=320\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"320\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_2051.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1735\" title=\"IMG_2051\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_2051.jpg?w=480&#038;h=320\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"320\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_2092.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1737\" title=\"IMG_2092\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_2092.jpg?w=480&#038;h=320\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"320\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/mum1.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1746\" title=\"mum1\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/mum1.jpg?w=480&#038;h=720\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"720\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">{linking with <a href=\"http://mylittledrummerboys.blogspot.com.au/\">My Little Drummer Boys</a> for Wordless Wednesday}</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/heartmamaxx\"><br />\nPlease join me at the Heart Mama community on Facebook.</a></p>\n", "post_id": 1727, "location": false, "date": "10-09-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["anger", "tantrums", "karma", "family"], "text": "<p>There was a time, when I was a kid, when I would fling myself around in what was affectionately known as a &#8220;tanty&#8221;. My arms would fly, my voice would raise, and I would behave as if the world was about to end. Believe me, I had some points that needed to be made, but admittedly, in hindsight, they could have been made a little more gracefully.</p>\n<p>In my family, I was not the first to have a tanty. I was witness to chairs being thrown over balconies, grandmas yelling at grandchildren because they didn&#8217;t like brandy sauce and vice versa and family members yelling from one end of the table to the other. Somehow, these tanties always left a pleasing residue, and we would pat ourselves on the back because, unlike the majority, we really knew how to express ourselves.</p>\n<p>As I have aged, and at 28 I have indeed aged, I am pleased to say that for me the tanty is generally a thing of the past. Except for this morning, when a piece of technology failed to deliver. Goddamn that piece of crap. I yelled, I screamed. Poor Elki tried to read a book with me, and after a page, I was too angry to go on, and had to hand her over to her father. She wasn&#8217;t happy and had her own tanty. It was miserable. I had descended into bad behaviour.</p>\n<p>See, the thing is, that since I have met Greg, who isn&#8217;t a fan of my tanties, I have tantied no more. Apart for that one occasion when I dropped my bag onto the floor in a rage, and broke my camera, which of course was karma biting me on the bum. And because my tanties are generally a thing of the past, I feel <em>better. </em>It&#8217;s amazing how bad a tanty can make you feel. Unlike my family&#8217;s belief that tanties are great for the soul, as they allow you to release, I believe that tanties actually make you feel worse. For me, anger is fast followed by guilt and remorse. Which, as a Buddhist will tell you, is actually karma. A psychological reaction to mental action.</p>\n<p>So when I flew off in a rage this morning because my Optus wireless device was not working, I immediately regretted my outburst and felt like crap. Especially because my daughter then proceeded to be upset. My tanty provoked another. Our children are sponges&#8230;absorbing <em>everything </em>we do. Of course we can&#8217;t always maintain perfect standards. Occasionally we have to be human. But for me it has been a good lesson in observing my actions. Beware, my child is watching and learning from me. And this is a lot like karma&#8230;my actions are reflected back at me, and the consequences are immediate. Next time my Optus wireless device fails me, someone please remind me that Elka will be copying my behaviour!</p>\n", "post_id": 174, "location": false, "date": "07-14-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["family", "parenting", "guest post", "birth", "siblings", "children"], "text": "<p><em>Introducing Catherine from <a href=\"http://www.cupofteaandablog.com\">Cup of Tea and a Blog</a>&#8230;Catherine kindly accepted my invitation to guest post for Heart Mama during my babymoon.\u00a0Serendipitously, she writes about something that is going on for me right this moment&#8230;</em></p>\n<p><em>Head over to <a href=\"http://www.cupofteaandablog.com\">Cup of Tea and a Blog</a> to read more from Catherine.</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/catherine2.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1753\" title=\"Catherine2\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/catherine2.jpg?w=480&#038;h=369\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"369\" /></a></p>\n<p>We brought baby C home from the hospital six hours after her beautiful water birth.

We had never had a night apart and I wanted to put her to bed, the same as every other night.</p>\n<p>The afternoon stretched on, I nursed C and dressed her in the tiny clothes I had packed weeks earlier. I felt overwhelmed with love for the little girl in my arms, but I longed for my other little girl too.</p>\n<p>G was fast asleep when my husband carried baby C into our home. We had fish and chips for dinner. My mother and step-father took turns to hold the beautiful new soul who had entered the world that afternoon.</p>\n<p>I didn\u2019t sleep well. And it wasn\u2019t because I had a newborn baby that needed feeding, it was because I was excited, and nervous. I couldn\u2019t wait for the morning to come and for G to meet her little sister for the very first time.</p>\n<p>G woke up early, I wondered if I\u2019d willed it so. My husband brought her in.

Her first was care of my sister-in-law: &#8220;This is the Way&#8221;, which I read to her when she was about 6 week\u00a0old, lying on the change table. Her little face lit up as she followed the lyrical sounds of the elephant boom, bang, crashing and the mouse skittle, scattle, scuttling. This is still a favourite. Also from my sister-in-law came the very funny &#8220;Goodnight Gorilla&#8221;, which is a picture book with few words but loads of sentiment. And Graeme Base&#8217;s &#8220;Waterhole&#8221;, which Elka pours over every car trip.

For example, Oranges and Lemons&#8230;I love that one, and the pictures are so sweet, of olde worlde children playing together. The last verse of that rhyme, however, goes:\u00a0&#8220;Here comes a candle to light you to bed,\u00a0And here comes a chopper to chop off your head!\u201d</p>\n<p>Then &#8220;There was an old woman who lived in a shoe.&#8221; Apparently she had too many children, so ended up whipping them all and sending them to bed with no food. Great parenting style lady! I guess this was before contraception and single mother&#8217;s benefit, so I should be a little more understanding.</p>\n<p>And we all know the tragedy of &#8220;Rock-a-bye baby&#8221; \u00a0&#8211; I can&#8217;t bring myself to read the words out to Elka. She thinks when the bough breaks, the baby does fly. One day she will tell me to get real.</p>\n<p>Then of course there are the sexist, dodgy nursery rhymes like &#8220;Peter Peter Pumpkin Eater&#8221; who had a wife and couldn&#8217;t keep her so ended up keeping her in a pumpkin shell where there he kept her very well.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_182\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/bearinunderwear.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-182\" title=\"Bear in Underwear\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/bearinunderwear.jpg?w=300&#038;h=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Bear in Underwear courtesy of Amazon</p></div>\n<p>But, in contemporary times, things have become a little more PC. Elka&#8217;s latest read is &#8220;Bear in Underwear&#8221;, a very funny, slightly weird comic style book about a bear who, having absconded from a game of hide and seek with friends, trips over a bag of underwear. After trying on all of them, he eventually finds a pair that fits. My favourite line is: &#8220;The tighty whitey underwear was just right &#8211; the perfect fit!&#8221; And all his friends got to wear the rest.</p>\n<p>And of course there is &#8220;Go the f*@k to sleep&#8221;, which is on everyone&#8217;s facebook and webpage at the moment. PC? Um, no. But funny, for the parents. Elka hated it&#8230;she is usually glued to a new book, especially one with a good beat, but this one was flung across the room. Ok ok, it&#8217;s not a children&#8217;s book, it is a book for adults disguised as a children&#8217;s book. We should have known you would know better!</p>\n<p>Her absolute favourite book of all time, though, is &#8220;The Owl and The Pussycat&#8221;, which I am thrilled by, because this has to be my favourite story too. Thank goodness the one book Elka insists on reading eight times in a row is a book I too get endless pleasure from.</p>\n<p>And if you stay tuned, and you are really lucky, I may even post my own children&#8217;s book (rejected by publishers, but hey, we know it should have been a best-seller!)</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_179\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/owlpussycat.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-179 \" title=\"The Owl &amp; The Pussycat courtesy of Home Office\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/owlpussycat.jpg?w=300&#038;h=299\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"299\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Owl &amp; The Pussycat courtesy of Home Office</p></div>\n", "post_id": 177, "location": false, "date": "07-15-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["parenting", "gentle parenting", "children", "conscious parenting"], "text": "<p>I am very pleased to invite Alexandra from <a href=\"http://aliveandblogging.com/\">Alive and Blogging</a> to Heart Mama today.

A pram is easier, they say.<br />\nWhy bother having a disrupted sleep when you can just put the baby in another room? Sleep training is easier, they say.<br />\nWhy bother being with your baby all the time when you can just use formula and have her babysat? Bottle feeding is easier, they say.<br />\nWhy bother experiencing your birth naturally when someone else can do it for you? Drugs and intervention in labour is easier, they say.   </p>\n<p>There have been many times that I have started to doubt myself and my choices after being asked these types of things. It wasn\u2019t until my daughter (now 22 months) was about 13 months old that I had a strong support network around me and I knew that my instincts were a reliable source! I can\u2019t stress how important that was/is to know.  </p>\n<p>I don\u2019t write the above questions and statements as an argument about one choice over another. They are merely reflections on what I have chosen in this journey of parenting. Regardless of your choices, I imagine there will be someone who thinks that their way of doing things is easier!</p>\n<p>I remember someone suggesting to me at one point that I was just a sucker for punishment because I was still parenting my 8 month old at night\u2026 They said (and I quote) \u201cI don\u2019t know why you bother with her in your room and waking up at night to feed her. We just put our kids in their own room the day we brought them home from the hospital and they soon learnt to soothe themselves to sleep. Our third child was noisier than the first two so we just put him in a room further away.\u201d  </p>\n<p>That got me thinking\u2026 is it really about the \u2018easier\u2019 option? It depends on your values.  I decided that it\u2019s not about what is \u2018easier\u2019 and what\u2019s not. It\u2019s not about that at all. Ease is a subjective measure. It changes depending on circumstance and it changes from person to person.  So why do we make particular choices when it comes to parenting (or to any other roles for that matter)? Where do these choices come from?  </p>\n<p>I think that we all make decisions based on our individual knowledge, experiences, values and available support at any given time. We all have these things innately within us &#8211; like \u2018foundations\u2019 and we can continually build on them and grow from them, and they in turn shape our next choice or direction. Of course, these vary from person to person too.  </p>\n<p>The doubt comes when we forget our own knowledge, experiences and values and that is where we run into conflicts &#8211; when we face decisions that we aren\u2019t comfortable with, when we have regrets and when we have those internal battles between our head and heart. It is then that we make a choice based on someone else\u2019s values, knowledge and experiences and if they don\u2019t quite align with our own.. We feel stuck. Helpless. Lost.  </p>\n<p>When people ask me why I bother with doing things the way I do, I generally explain something about giving my children the best start to life that I know how so that they can go from there in whichever direction they choose. But what does that even mean?  Sometimes I feel the need to provide the research on the health benefits of the choices that I make. Sometimes I feel the need to share the scientific evidence about a child\u2019s psychological development to support the choices I make. I had to actually stop and ask myself \u2018why?\u2019  When did \u2018because it feels right\u2019 not become satisfactory? </p>\n<p>I had to make a very conscious decision to follow my instincts, regardless of what others told me to do, think, be. As Zanni often talks about, it is \u2018parenting from the heart\u2019 that makes it all clear &#8211; when you come from a place of love, there are no hard choices and there are no internal battles. It all just makes sense. It is no longer a matter of \u2018bothering\u2019.  </p>\n<p>I write this to you Zanni (and to any of your readers who need to hear it at times). I may not be near you to fill your freezer with food, to pop in when you\u2019re having one of \u2018those\u2019 days or to play with your girls while you have a shower. So instead I just send this\u2026 My way of offering you support, acknowledgement and love. I know you have a wonderful support network so it is my hope that you rarely feel alone or lost. </p>\n<p>If you ever do, please know that you are doing it right. You are doing it well. You are a wonderful role model to so many other women and you are the support that many others look for. I love that you follow your heart and I love that you share it. Little Eve has chosen a wonderful time and place to enter this world. Love, support and the ability to follow her instincts are all a mother needs to be able to raise a wonderful child.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/20121015-204620.jpg\"><img src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/20121015-204620.jpg\" alt=\"20121015-204620.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n<p>Linking with Jess from Diary of a SAHM for IBOT.</p>\n", "post_id": 1771, "location": false, "date": "10-15-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["one lovely blog award", "my happy life", "awards", "blogging", "acknowledgements"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/one-love-blog-award.jpeg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1776\" title=\"one-love-blog-award\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/one-love-blog-award.jpeg?w=227&#038;h=270\" height=\"270\" width=\"227\" /></a></p>\n<p>Since I wrote this\u00a0<a href=\"http://heartmama.net/2012/06/12/watching-the-cool-girls-hang/\">Watching the Cool Girls Hang</a>\u00a0in June, my little Heart Mama community has grown. It was like opening a valve&#8230;exposing my blog&#8217;s little heart&#8230;my little heart.</p>\n<p>Soon after, I was contacted by the director of\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.mumgo.com.au\">Mumgo</a>, and asked to write weekly feature blog posts for Mumgo&#8217;s new and fast-growing site. I had a buzz for days, thinking about the huge honour and compliment this was. My little blog had received it&#8217;s first significant acknowledgement.</p>\n<p>In August , I wrote\u00a0<em><a href=\"http://heartmama.net/2012/08/06/how-to-grow-a-child/\">How to Grow a Child</a>.\u00a0</em>The response was heart-warming.

I knew my husband for two weeks (physically) and three months inter-continentally before he proposed, and I accepted. Six years later, we still enjoy a beautiful, strong relationship; full of support and nourishment and kindness. He is my backbone, my strength, my antidote and the\u00a0<a href=\"http://heartmama.net/2012/09/04/on-fathers-day/\">best father to my children</a>\u00a0one could ever hope for.</p>\n<p>2. I used to manage a very reputable contemporary art gallery in Melbourne. For many years, art was my love and my life. I worked closely with talented artists, and committed clients. Working at the gallery was a very colourful period in my life, and taught me much about business and art and how the two go hand in hand. It was through the gallery that I met my husband.</p>\n<p>3. 2005 was the hardest year of my life. It was my gap year, essentially, when I set sail into unknown lands, and lived a year in London. Cold, dreary, grey London. I arrived in the middle of winter and struggled for the next twelve months to find my feet&#8230;a job, a National Insurance number, a bank account, friends, myself. My heart was broken, and it was only on returning to Australia that I was able to heal.</p>\n<p>4. I went to boarding school for five years. Although I made deep friendships and was taught to use my cutlery correctly, as well as other ways of being a lady, I wouldn&#8217;t recommend it.</p>\n<p>5. Choosing to go to boarding school was not out of character, as I spent a childhood &#8216;running away from home&#8217;. My greatest expedition was at the age of six. Little brother in tow, I marched us along the country hi-way towards town &#8211; the incentive for my brother being to buy lollies. A kindly neighbour spotted us, although we leapt into the tall grass on the side of the road every time a car passed in case it was the police, and informed my parents.</p>\n<p>I would like to nominate the following five for One Lovely Blog Award:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://enjoylifeforonce.wordpress.com/\">Enjoy Life For Once</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://www.raising-humans.com/\">Raising Humans</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://thelittlemumma.typepad.com/\">The Little Mumma</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://www.walkingintheslowlane.blogspot.com.au/\">A\u00a0Lifetime of Days</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://www.cupofteaandablog.com/\">Cup of Tea and a Blog</a></p>\n<p>Of course, there are many other blogs I would love to nominate&#8230;but I will keep my nominations to five.</p>\n<p>Thank you again, Brianna, for the acknowledgement. xx</p>\n", "post_id": 1775, "location": false, "date": "10-16-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["body", "woman", "motherhood", "parenting", "birth", "natural birth"], "text": "<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong><em>So welcome, little Eve, our newly unfurled Rose<br />\n</em></strong><strong><em>May your precious innocence<br />\n</em></strong><strong><em>Refresh our garden as it grows<br />\n</em></strong><strong><em>With hope renewed in Eden to make a brighter place<br />\n</em></strong><strong><em>A paradise enlightened by the glow of your sweet grace.<br />\n</em></strong>Uncle Perry, 7 October 2012</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">My first daughter waited for fireworks. The full moon. A partial lunar eclipse. She wanted her photograph on page two of the local paper:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.northernstar.com.au/news/heavens-put-on-a-show-for-first-new-year-baby/439209/\"><em>First baby born of the decade.</em></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">My second daughter waited until the time was perfect; until she inconvenienced no-one.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><a href=\"http://heartmama.net/2012/10/04/peddling-in-purgatory/\">I had been frustrated and wanting baby to arrive</a>. No amount of walking in soft sand or pineapple made any difference. Sunday the seventh was the first day I did nothing, and was happy just to wait. After a hot morning at the markets, we had lunch at my parents&#8217; house. That afternoon, our stomachs full, the niggling that had been happening every afternoon that week and the previous week began. Niggle. Niggle. I kicked Gregor under the table, and smiled at him.\u00a0<em>This could be it.\u00a0</em>I was saying. We decided to wait on, in case it really was it. Finally.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em>The time was perfect.</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Going in to labour now would mean we could leave Elka at my parents&#8217; house, and be able to explain where we were going. What was happening.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I had a bath around 5pm. I was sure, now, that this really was it. Contractions were evenly paced, five minutes apart. My body was doing what it has known for centuries how to do. I sat quietly in the bath, my birth music on the stereo.\u00a0<em>You better ring the midwife,\u00a0</em>I said.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">My first birth was relatively fast &#8211; I was fully dilated within three hours. We decided this time to go to hospital straight away, so I wouldn&#8217;t be driving half an hour in full labour.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">We said goodbye to Elka. She was so excited.\u00a0<em>The baby was coming.</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Twilight. The light was familiar. It was the same time of day my labour with Elka had begun. I always knew labour would start at that time of day.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">By the time we reached hospital, my contractions were more frequent.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em>The time was perfect.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Many patients had been discharged that afternoon. The birth suite was quiet. The whole hospital was quiet. My midwife, Julia, met us, and took us to a beautiful teal room. The lights were dim. A picture of a whale and her calf hung on the wall.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I had time to settle in to the room, change clothes. I sat on the gym ball, a blanket over my back, and\u00a0leaned against the bed. I stayed there for one and a half hours. Contractions surged.\u00a0<em>My body was doing what it has known for centuries how to do.\u00a0</em>With each contraction, I breathed deeper, and let myself drift with each wave. It was everywhere in my body. My mind. And then the tide would go out, and I would rest my head against the bed. In the moment. Allowing myself just to be. Not to anticipate. Just to be.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">It was nine o&#8217;clock. I began to doubt myself. My strength wavered. I acknowledged this was transition. Moments later, I kicked the gym ball away, and stood by the bed in a standing squat. My muscles quaked. I was bearing down. The sounds changed. Without thought, <em>my body did what it has known for centuries how to do.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Gregor was there. The midwife was there, both kneeling behind me. I placed my hand on the baby&#8217;s head, and instinctually caught her, guiding her body up to mine.\u00a0<em>My body was doing what it has known for centuries how to do. My baby was birthing as it has known for centuries how to birth.</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">We didn&#8217;t think to check the sex initially, so overwhelmed we were with the power of what had just happened. She came out in the caul. An omen. The cord was wrapped twice around her neck. The midwife lifted it off, and she regained her colour immediately. She<em> was</em> a girl. Elka was right all along.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I hadn&#8217;t given the birth much thought before it took place. I wanted a natural, intervention free birth, ideally, but knew you couldn&#8217;t predict or control every situation. I hadn&#8217;t done much to prepare. But somewhere inside of me I knew it would all be fine.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">It was. The time was perfect. The birth was perfect.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Little Eve, our newly unfurled Rose, you make me proud to be a woman. You remind me of a mother&#8217;s strength and the power of birth. You gave me the greatest gift &#8211; a perfect birth, a perfect baby. For that, I am grateful.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/eve-rose.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1782\" title=\"eve rose\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/eve-rose.jpg?w=480&#038;h=480\" height=\"480\" width=\"480\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">{linking with Kate for <a href=\"http://www.katesaysstuff.com/\">Thankful Thursday</a>\u00a0and Grace from <a href=\"http://www.withsomegrace.com/\">With Some Grace for FYBF</a>}</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong><em>Please join me at the <a href=\"http://facebook.com/heartmamaxx\">Heart Mama Community</a> on Facebook.</em></strong></p>\n", "post_id": 1780, "location": false, "date": "10-18-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["relationships", "siblings", "friendship", "children", "relationship"], "text": "<p><em><strong>Introducing Danielle from<a href=\"http://http://keepingupwiththeholsbys.com/\"> Keeping Up With The Holsbys</a>.

She is transfixed by the golden haired boy; her big brother. He runs back and forth in her line of vision, delighting in the fact that she turns her head to watch him, over and over again. She gazes at him adoringly, startling every now and then at his squeals, and he basks in her attention. Their giggles are like fairy laughter in my ears as I observe these first independent interactions of my first-born son, and new-ish daughter.</p>\n<p>This is their earliest play developing, and they are so happy to just be near each other.</p>\n<p>My son, D Man, often looks to me with his little arms outstretched -</p>\n<p><i>&#8216;Hold, Baby?&#8217;<br />\n</i></p>\n<p>We set them up so they&#8217;re safe and supported and gently put Kiki in his arms, and he just sniffs her and kisses her head&#8230;..then he gets bored and he pushes her away so she face plants on the couch and he reaches for a plastic dinosaur with one hand and picks his nose with the other&#8230;..but the first part is no less beautiful.</p>\n<p>I have high hopes for these two, you know. I really hope that they&#8217;re friends in the life they have yet before them. I hope they will be a shoulder for each other, a confidant, and a steady rock in a crazy, uncertain world.</p>\n<p>When we were growing up , my brother and I did not have a great relationship from our early &#8216;tweens until our twenties. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s just normal, but I&#8217;m sad about all of the years we didn&#8217;t get along.</p>\n<p>We come from a single parent family and Mama Bear was working hard to bring home the bacon, so we had a lot of time to torment each other and for him to beat the proverbial out of me. He was a cranky butt-head, that brother of mine, but he&#8217;s now a lovely, gentle, mellow husband and father, and I&#8217;m proud to call him my friend.</p>\n<p>Disregarding those tumultuous years, when we were little tackers we had a ball. Obviously, I was a pesky little sister and he was an annoying big brother, but there are many early family photos of us just loving the crap outta each other. Images of laughing in the snow, both of us packed like peas in a pod into a sled, playing in the bath, hanging out in the sun in our garden.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a funny old relationship, the sibling one. No one in the world can irritate you as wildly, nor escalate your temper from a mellow 2 to a raging 10 in mere seconds, but ok as it may be to pick on your sibling, look out should anyone else have a crack at them&#8230;.look out, indeed.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know how best to encourage a great relationship between my two. Is it just an organic thing or are there ways to nurture the love early on, so that they maintain a level of love and respect for each other?</p>\n<p>How can you promote friendship instead of rivalry?</p>\n<p>I imagine it comes very much down to personalities. One must bear in mind the old adage of &#8216;you can choose your friends, but you can&#8217;t choose your family&#8217;. I guess it&#8217;s possible that they&#8217;ll grow up to be two different people, with nothing in common except they grew in the same womb, and share the same DNA, but if I was to stimulate a good bond from very early on then, surely, great sibling benevolence can grow?</p>\n<p>I vow to do my best to ensure a lifetime friendship grows, if I notice things going awry I will try to help them gently work things out, fairly, and with respect for one another. They are great lessons for life in general, are they not? You can&#8217;t wrestle over the last biscuit in your work place kitchen , no matter how dearly you may desire to at 4pm when that sugar low hits.</p>\n<p>I will endeavour to give them both time with me on their own, in an effort to prevent rivalry so they both feel comfortable with their place in my heart, yet understand my heart is big enough for them both, or all if, heaven&#8217;s above, there are more children in my future!</p>\n<p>I also read a piece of advice by NY Times writer Lisa Belkin that you need to let them have a relationship independent of you, as their parent.</p>\n<p>They need to have secrets, and with this in mind, they need to have fights, and they need to be able to sort it out between themselves.</p>\n<p>As a control freak, micro-manager, I&#8217;ll try to bear this in mind, and if allowing a little Lord of the Flies from time to time encourages little people to find their own dynamic, then on the sidelines I shall stand and let bonds blossom, for I have truly high hopes for this pair.</p>\n<p>{Linking with <a href=\"http://diaryofasahm.net\">Jess at Diary of a SAHM for IBOT</a>.

This is quite possibly because first time round, we by-passed this stage, desperate we were not to be cooped up in a hot-box on a hill with a crying baby.</p>\n<p>The day we drove home with baby Eve from the hospital, my husband text messaged a guy from one of his three jobs to let him know he was cancelling the shift. <em>Should I go in Wednesday? </em>he asked me. Seeing as it was Monday, and we were driving home from hospital with a new baby, I said: <em>Absolutely not. No *ucking way. You are such a Yes Man.</em></p>\n<p>And so it was, despite my husband&#8217;s natural inclination to work like a dog, he cancelled two weeks of work, and we nestled into our little home. Apart from two brief outings to buy milk, I literally haven&#8217;t left the house. Given my personality, this is remarkable. And surprisingly, it has been wonderful.</p>\n<p>Day one, a colleague of Gregor dropped food in for us. Day two, another colleague came with a mountain of presents &#8211; baby nappies, wipes, bathing products, breast pads, presents for Elka &#8211; she had it all covered. Several days later, a friend dropped in to bring me lunch and keep me company. Another friend brought around a delicious Moroccan casserole for dinner. My aunt insisted on being available for house-hold duties, like bringing in the washing or do the washing-up. My mum is coming to stay tonight, when Gregor goes to work, to help me with the girls and all the chores. We have been surrounded by generosity and warmth. This is everything my Heart Mama heart desires. Community. Support. Connections. <em><a href=\"http://heartmama.net/2012/08/06/how-to-grow-a-child/\">These are the roots that support us.</a> </em></p>\n<p>With much needed time together and no demands placed on us, our little family has flourished. We have slept in each morning. Had a lazy breakfast. We have chipped away at house chores in between singing silly songs together, or dancing around the living room. My husband has taken up gardening and wearing a sarong. It&#8217;s been busy, for sure, buzzing around and meeting everyone&#8217;s needs throughout the day, folding washing or washing the dishes at 11pm&#8230;busy, but beautiful.</p>\n<p>Day by day, we are working out Eve&#8217;s sleep pattern. Her feeding pattern. Her little temperament. <em>Sweet as a rose, she is</em>.</p>\n<p>Day by day, we are amazed by Elka&#8217;s adaptability  as she goes from only child to big sister. With literally two minor glitches, which revealed that a) she wants to do everything Eve does b) she too occasionally needs special attention, she has welcomed Little Eve, <em>Lovely Little Eve</em>, into her home and her heart. Elka still insists that I take her to bed each night.

Out along the path, a family of four, getting fresh air and sunshine.</p>\n<p>We reached the sport fields. A mass of little kids dressed in blue and white played cricket. Their faces were scrunched in consternation. Their hands were clasped around the bats. All donned a hat, and zinc was smeared on each and every little nose.</p>\n<p>Families hugged the sidelines, huddled around eskies and picnic rugs. Parents sat in fold-out chairs.</p>\n<p>From one end of the field to the other, all I heard from the sidelines was:</p>\n<p><em>Don&#8217;t.<br />\n</em>Don&#8217;t hit the pine cone with your bat.<br />\nDon&#8217;t take your hat off.<br />\nDon&#8217;t go too close to the pitch.<br />\nDon&#8217;t. Don&#8217;t. Don&#8217;t.</p>\n<p>We reached the playground. The younger siblings of the kids in blue and white hurried through the tunnel, up the ladder, down the slide. Three kids raced round and round the equipment.</p>\n<p>Mothers hung at the fence, their sunnies propped on scrunched noses.</p>\n<p>All I heard from the sidelines was:</p>\n<p><em>Don&#8217;t.<br />\n</em>Don&#8217;t block the slide.<br />\nDon&#8217;t run so fast.<br />\nDon&#8217;t dirty your shoes.<br />\nDon&#8217;t.

Briony, say goodbye to the other little girl, do you hear me?</p>\n<p>From one end of the sport field to the other, I didn&#8217;t hear one positive thing said to a child. Everything was a restriction. A limitation. A boundary. There was no space to\u00a0manoeuvre. No space for a little child just to <i>be.\u00a0</i></p>\n<p>And yet it was a <i>playground.\u00a0</i>A\u00a0<em>game\u00a0</em>of cricket.</p>\n<p>The little boy put down his cricket bat, dejected.

Just fine. Because people always ask, <em>How is Elka coping with it all?</em></p>\n<p>And she has been fine. Remarkably adaptable. Gregor has been around a lot, so she has been thriving; showered in love, sunshine and attention. Bringing a baby home seemed better than a birthday party. Better than chocolate-coated strawberries on a stick. The whole family was around, and it was one great fat holiday.</p>\n<p>Now, work resumes, and reality sets in.</p>\n<p>Is it all fine? I am not so sure. Little Elka has been lying around a lot. She says she&#8217;s tired. Then there are the times she says, <em>Stop breastfeeding Mum!</em> or pushes Eve&#8217;s little hand away from my breast. There have been may times that I can&#8217;t come to her when she needs me. Times when I have to put Eve&#8217;s needs before Elka&#8217;s. </p>\n<p>We had a few moments when Elka&#8217;s affections became too rough, too much love, and I had to pull away, or ask Elka to be gentle. My mother&#8217;s protective instinct was torn between protecting one baby&#8217;s life, and one baby&#8217;s heart. I don&#8217;t want Elka to feel like she can&#8217;t show Eve affection. But of course a baby&#8217;s head is so soft; so vulnerable. </p>\n<p>Elka expressed her disapproval by rolling around on the floor, her head buried. <em>I&#8217;m sad about you. </em> She would say. </p>\n<p>Once she turned away from me, going to sleep. She pulled her arm away. </p>\n<p>Often she clings to her daddy, <em>I want my Daddy,</em> she says. </p>\n<p>I understand Elka feels sad. It&#8217;s such a huge transition. My focus now is on listening to her. Being there for her. </p>\n<p>Psychologist Robin Grille talks about the importance of maintaining a connection with our toddlers. He says the key to a healthy connection is authenticity &#8211; being honest with your feelings, and allowing a toddler to be honest about their emotions. </p>\n<p>This works for me. Elka certainly knows when I am frustrated, angry or sad. She also witnesses me work through it. Sometimes I need to apologise to her, and I feel like she hears me, and accepts my apology. Likewise, I am listening to her. I am seeing her feel sad. I am empathising with her pain. Of course, having a little sister rocks your world. It&#8217;s a huge transition. And I am all open ears. Open hearted. </p>\n<p>With love and patience, I hope we will move through this with grace. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/20121101-130548.jpg\"><img src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/20121101-130548.jpg\" alt=\"20121101-130548.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a></p>\n<p><em><strong>Please join me at <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/heartmamaxx?ref=tn_tnmn\">Heart Mama</a> on Facebook</strong></em></p>\n<p>Linking with lovely Grace at <a href=\"http://www.withsomegrace.com\">With Some Grace</a>.</p>\n", "post_id": 1817, "location": false, "date": "11-01-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>Simply beautiful.

Learning to read. Writing stories. Making friends. Baking cakes. Being a mother. Being a wife.</p>\n<p>In Year 8, I over-heard another 14 year-old from the cool group remark to her cool friends that:\u00a0<em>Zanni thinks she is so good at everything, especially art.</em></p>\n<p>The truth was, I didn&#8217;t think I was much good at anything, especially art, but I tried mightily. I tried my damnedest to do things to perfection.</p>\n<p>Mostly, I was able to master my task. I learnt to read. Write stories. Make friends. My cake baking is far under par, but I think I am a pretty good mother. Watching my almost-three-year-old swing her little hips and rock her crazy blonde locks around the house as she composes some funky tune, I feel like I have done a good job so far. She is happy.</p>\n<p>But lately, I question how good a wife I am.</p>\n<p>I am bossy. Nagging. Cranky. It&#8217;s like all my good goes to my children, and my husband gets my bad.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not always so, but it&#8217;s worse at the moment. I&#8217;m worse.</p>\n<p>A similar thing followed the birth of Elka. From spick and span, happy-go-lucky, crazy in love we went, and came out the other side naggy and grumpy. Me that is. Not him.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know what happened. I just got the grumps, and he got the pointy end of the deal.</p>\n<p>It cleared up. He was patient. Resilient. Happy-go-lucky. I was lucky.</p>\n<p>We fell back into happiness after that. Rolling from one caf\u00e9 to the other. Talking big dreams and theories about life and about nonsense. We shared the joy of our beautiful baby becoming toddler becoming child. We shared her joy and each others. We got pregnant and shared the joy of a beautiful birth. They have been happy years.</p>\n<p>But after the second birth, I am Naggy-von-Niggle again. Over everything and nothing. Like the belt that was left on the table this afternoon.</p>\n<p>I confessed the other morning that I wasn&#8217;t feeling affectionate towards him at the moment. He looked forlornly into his lap. I had just confirmed his suspicions. I felt bad, but my confession made me feel lighter. It was true. I have been feeling unaffectionate towards him. And it isn&#8217;t his fault. It&#8217;s mine &#8211; or biology, or something.</p>\n<p>Maybe, after birth, the lack of affection is a protective mechanism. A contraception. Nature doesn&#8217;t want you making more babies just yet, so it makes you cranky at your partner. That is my reckoning &#8211; does it fly? I am not sure.</p>\n<p>All I know is that my crankiness, and my lack of affection is draining our resources. Two little girls, beautiful in every way. Four jobs between us. Other commitments like tidying the house and mowing the lawn. We can&#8217;t keep on top of it all if I keep dragging it down.</p>\n<p>Tonight, I am looking inwards.

A little house for her to live her make-believe worlds. A house of her very own, where she can make cups of tea for friends. Small cups of tea with small saucers.</p>\n<p>Growing up, we had a cubby house. &#8216;Twas the night before Christmas, Dad was out there hammering and sawing and erecting&#8230; less a cubby house, more a tower among the gum trees. A home in which to imagine.</p>\n<p>We fashioned other cubbies in the rainforest, in lantana, in an old olive tree&#8230;we befriended the resident fairies and pretended we were Big.</p>\n<p>At school, my make-believe grew up, and we played mums and dads. I was the mum or the dad, because I was the tallest. We made porridge for the baby and pretended to take her to the doctor.</p>\n<p>I am not sure if I ever grew up from there. Here I am twenty years later playing the same game. Hanging out washing. Washing dishes. I occasionally wear an apron, and a little girl calls me &#8220;Mum&#8221;. This cubby has a mortgage, and Dad certainly didn&#8217;t knock it up over night, but it&#8217;s still a cubby; a home in which to imagine. It doesn&#8217;t ever quite feel real.</p>\n<p>The nine-year-old me is the same as the twenty-three-year-old me is the same as the almost-thirty me. We changed a bit along the way, but I still can&#8217;t believe I am a Real Grown-up. How did I get to this point, where I actually <em>can</em> make babies, and I actually <em>can</em>\u00a0reach the washing line? It feels so surreal, when I stop and give it a thought.</p>\n<p>And it seems I am not the only one&#8230;when I posted this sentiment on my <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/heartmamaxx?ref=hl\">Facebook page</a> last week, several people responded \u00a0-</p>\n<p><em>I&#8217;m 34 with 4 children ranging from 13 down to 1. I don&#8217;t &#8216;feel&#8217; 34. How did that happen? Why am I doing all the washing and cleaning and&#8230;Where&#8217;s the grown-up?</em></p>\n<p><em>30 with three children, and I feel like I&#8217;m still in the &#8220;fake it til you make it&#8221; stage. Some days I feel hyper-aware of my self, and it doesn&#8217;t feel real.</em></p>\n<p><em>I often feel like I am a nanny&#8230;or have been temporarily inserted into someone else&#8217;s life.\u00a0I keep expecting to wake up and be sixteen again.</em></p>\n<p><em>\u00a0I feel like I am pretending to be my mum.</em></p>\n<p>Is this Peter Pan phenomenon universal? Are we all little kids living in a make-believe world? A cubby on the clouds? And does someone, at some point, arrive at our front door with a letter to say that at last, we are it? We are the Real Deal. We are Legitimate Adults.</p>\n<p>I watch my little girl buzz around the garden talking to Christopher Robin about drop bears and jagulars and pigs in trees. Her world is so magical. Although her creatures are more colourful and can do far more interesting things, she experiences her imaginary world in the same way I experience my real world &#8211; we just go along, accepting everything that happens. Like me, she will move from this imaginary world to the next and\u00a0seamlessly\u00a0into reality as if they are all one and the same. The fantasy will continue and will never feel quite real. Just as Real will always feel a little like Fantasy.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong><em>Please join me at the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/heartmamaxx?ref=hl\">Heart Mama Community </a>on Facebook.</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">{linking with\u00a0<a href=\"http://essentiallyjess.com/\">Essentially Jess</a> for IBOT}</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "post_id": 1866, "location": false, "date": "11-19-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["parenting", "wish list", "gentle parenting", "guilt", "choices"], "text": "<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em>I choose&#8230;<br />\n</em><em>Eye contact over iPhone<br />\nUnderstanding over exasperation<br />\nCalm over hysterical<br />\nPatience over frustration<br />\nHugs over smacks<br />\nLaughter over tears<br />\nConversation over television<em><br />\n</em></em><em><em>Mess over tidiness<br />\n</em></em><em>Dancing over boredom.</em></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1873\" style=\"width: 346px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/elka-and-eve.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-1873 \" title=\"elka and eve\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/elka-and-eve.jpg?w=336&#038;h=504\" height=\"504\" width=\"336\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">My choice</p></div>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em>\u00a0</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">This is my wish list.

All she wanted was her blue shovel.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I don&#8217;t smack, but I find myself tensing in anger over something small and insignificant, like a toddler who wants to wear ballet shoes to the park even though it&#8217;s obviously impractical, especially as her mummy can&#8217;t bend over to tie up the laces with a baby in the sling.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">We all three were crying as we left the park&#8230;me, because I had to go to the toilet and Elka was not ready to leave, Eve, because she couldn&#8217;t sleep and needed to, and Elka because she didn&#8217;t want to climb out of the tree and come home. I would have chosen laughter over all that.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I tap away at my computer, trying to finish a chapter of my book while baby sleeps, and Elka tells me she needs a friend to play with.

The weeping fig continued to burst, and became a forest as high as the sky, obscuring what is now our house, our letter box and our lawn. The early-morning tidy-town walkers  tut tutted the branches and berries that littered the tidy road of our tidy town.</p>\n<p>Our forest served the function of obscuring our house from the tidy-town walkers, but other than littering the tidy road, it also made our house very cold in winter, and made solar-panels on the roof unviable. Mr Moss told us that if we left Weeping Fig much longer, it would be forever unmanageable, so he advised taking action.</p>\n<p>And so we did. Or so Mr Moss did. And he brought along the wood chipper, which came with a man called Noel. Noel wore a hard hat and pushed the fallen branches into the chipper, which munched them up and spat chips out into a trailer.</p>\n<p>Elka pressed her nose against the glass of the window. Fascinated. <em>What </em>are<em> they doing? </em>she asked.</p>\n<p>We made leave of the tree feller (Mr Moss) and Noel so no little children would be in the way of the large and dangerous task. On our drive to Mum&#8217;s, Elka talked incessantly about the Chimp and the trees, and how the Chimp ate the trees and that the Chimp was very very scary, but he was also nice. And he ate the trees. And he waved to us as we were going to our car. And he was at our house, and Daddy was looking after him, and was going to give him dinner and put him to bed. (Etc.)</p>\n<p>When we returned later that afternoon, Elka stared in amazement. <em>But what happened to our trees?</em></p>\n<p><em>The Chimp ate them</em>, I said. <em>Remember?</em></p>\n<p><em>But I don&#8217;t want the Chimp to eat our trees! I am scared of the Chimp! I am sad bout the trees! I want our trees!</em></p>\n<p>I realised, too, that I was sad about the trees. Our front lawn had a big hole in it, where Weeping Fig once was, and it was sad seeing the Chimp gobble them up. Those trees had done so much work to grow as big as they did, and now we were paying someone to destroy them. It was sad.</p>\n<p>I thought about Elka, and her compassion for the trees. It is amazing how young compassion is learnt. Or maybe it&#8217;s always there, inherent in our very beings. Elka has often shown compassion &#8211; to her friends, her Mummy, her Daddy&#8230;<em>Where does it hurt</em>? she frequently asks, <em>I will kiss it better. </em>Or<em> Eve is sad. I will kiss her, make her feel better. </em></p>\n<p>After Elka was in bed that night, Gregor and I talked about her fascination with Mr Moss (the tree feller) and the Chimp. All day, I thought the machine was the Chimp, but it turned out Noel was the Chimp. And her fondness for the Chimp has continued into the week. He has featured in many conversations since. As have our poor, fallen, chipped trees.</p>\n<p><em>How do you teach compassion to your children?

Sigh. This week, I have been wondering about the point of it all.</p>\n<p><strong>A night in Paris</strong></p>\n<p>Twenty years from now, Elka, Eve and I are sitting in a Parisian apartment, sipping Mo\u00ebt. We are gazing over the lights of the city. The Seine glimmers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Mum,&#8221; says Elka, &#8220;What were you thinking exactly, writing about Eve and I for all those years? What did you hope to achieve?&#8221;</p>\n<p>I sit back, leaning into the cushion. &#8220;Mmmm. I think initially that it helped me to remember. I needed to capture all those precious moments. Your quirks. Your little ideas and songs. You were both so beautiful&#8230;photographs weren&#8217;t enough. Then people started to read it, and respond. I received so much positive reinforcement that I kept on going. My writing got better as you two became more beautiful and more interesting. You grandma in Austria hung out for my posts. My blog became her thread to you. Through my words, she felt less estranged, even though thousands of\u00a0kilometres\u00a0separated you. So I just kept writing.</p>\n<p>&#8220;But at some point, I began to read other blogs. I realised there was an industry around blogging. Being a mum blogger wasn&#8217;t unique. In fact there were millions of us, all writing for similar reasons. Through blogging and reading other blogs, we came to understand more about each other. More about ourselves. So much of what we experienced was universal. A mother in another continent was going through exactly what we were at the same time. The occasional loneliness of motherhood disappeared, and the world shrunk.</p>\n<p>&#8220;And so I continued to blog. The blog continued to be about you, but something changed. You became instruments through which I could tell stories and express a world view to a wider audience, who were no longer just people I knew personally. Your language and thoughts became my language.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I realised I wanted my blog to be more than just about you girls &#8211; as perfect and gorgeous as you were, as you are, but about love and parenting in general. I wanted the world to be a better place for children everywhere, and felt that with your language and your stories, I could help inspire positive and gentle parenting.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Elka nods empathetically. I have more or less answered her question.</p>\n<p><strong>Mummy blogging</strong></p>\n<p>A month ago, to be or not to be a mummy blogger was widely talked about in the mummy blogging world, stimulated by the <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/s3616210.htm\">Media Watch episode that focussed on mummy bloggers</a>. \u00a0<a href=\"http://www.edenriley.com/2012/10/i-am-mummyblogger.html\">A few protested</a>&#8230;<em>I am not a mummy blogger, but a blogger who happens to have children</em>, they cried into the cyber night air.</p>\n<p>What came out of the episode was that mummy bloggers are powerful, persuasive, and a force to be reckoned with. They talked about how some &#8216;mummy bloggers&#8217; have a larger and more loyal audience than big columnists.</p>\n<p>My experience of the mummy and occasionally daddy blogging community is that it is incredibly supportive, and incredibly positive. In all the 1,349 comments on my blog, I have never had a negative one. On the contrary, people are so heart-warmingly, brain-boggling, mind-numbingly sweet that I often go to bed feeling all mushy inside.</p>\n<p>In my years of working at an art gallery and studying contemporary art, I rarely heard a positive comment towards an art work. In writing circles, members are keen to come back with feedback, often in the form of haughty\u00a0criticism. \u00a0Film reviews are quick to slag off a relatively enjoyable film. The arts has generally been bridled by the sneering critics, determined not to let mediocre in, and to protect the sanctity of their genre.</p>\n<p>Perhaps blogging is not an art, in the traditional sense. But with every post, I create, construct and ponder. Each post delivers the equivalent creative satisfaction that any short story or painting has ever done. My blog reflects my life and my life in turn reflects my blog. This is as close to art as I have been.</p>\n<p>Although I never set out to be a mum blogger, as such, but incidentally became one because I write a blog\u00a0<em>and\u00a0</em>have children, I embrace the positivity and generosity of the mum (and dad) blogging community.</p>\n<p>I have been thinking about where all this positivity gets us.</p>\n<p><strong>The power of positivity</strong></p>\n<p>As I always do with things I am involved with, I have been doubting myself and my abilities. I know my performance anxiety is merely habit, but it has stimulated me to ask myself why I do what I do, and spend so much time behind a computer after little ones are in bed.</p>\n<p>The key is positivity.</p>\n<p>As is also habit, when I feel down, I think about how I can help someone else, or make someone else&#8217;s life better, so I can feel better about myself. So, in a week of questioning my blogging purpose I have habitually stumbled on the thought that inspiring positivity is the point of it all.</p>\n<p>The blogging community is such a positive and supportive place to be. Also, I can write positive and truthful stories about my experiences. I can share sentiments that are intended to make people feel better. I can share sentiments that are intended to make lives better for our children. This is the heart of what I do, and why I bother.</p>\n<p>I am thinking particularly about <a href=\"http://www.edenriley.com/\">Eden Riley</a>, who spent the last two weeks in India with <a href=\"http://www.worldvision.com.au/Home.aspx\">World Vision</a>, sharing the realities of poverty and suffering with her many devoted readers; inspiring donations and compassion from a relatively privileged Western readership.</p>\n<p>Being a mummy blogger is a nice place to be, and I might be shooting high, but I think blogging generally has the power to infect people with good and make the world a better place.</p>\n<p><em>Do you ever question yourself?

When you have your baby, every other mother asks &#8220;So, how does she sleep?&#8221; And hence\u00a0<em>sleep\u00a0</em>is Chapter no. 2.</p>\n<p>I think the number one thing that defined the early months of being a mother was the incessant rocking, swinging, bouncing, shooshing, slinging, singing&#8230;every two hours all day, and then for about forty-five minutes or so every night. Elka only slept maximum forty minutes at a time during the day, and still does mostly. Firstly it worried me&#8230;it didn&#8217;t fit with the health nurse&#8217;s schedule, or the sleep clinic&#8217;s.</p>\n<p>I later learnt that most babies were the same&#8230;sometimes twenty minutes was normal. I don&#8217;t know where the health nurses were getting their norms from, but it certainly wasn&#8217;t from anyone I had come into contact with.</p>\n<p>And so I ceased worrying, and opted for the path of least resistance. For one thing, we were getting decent night sleeps, so I was in no position to complain about a thing. And in the day, the the Hug-a-Bub won out. For most hours of the day, my little bundle was wrapped close to my heart. It meant I could work at my computer, garden, have lunch with friends, clean the house, go for long walks at the beach&#8230;it felt amazing, and it also meant I more or less felt like a living breathing human being, albeit with a big green growth at my front. Even more lovely was that my husband &#8211; big, strong and masculine &#8211; got to wear our baby too, and feel that warm fuzzy mumma warmth that cannot be described, and usually shared, with our male counterparts.</p>\n<p>Some babes don&#8217;t like the sling, but ours didn&#8217;t like prams, and LOVED the sling&#8230;so to anyone who&#8217;s looking for an answer to day sleeps&#8230;try anything that works, and don&#8217;t worry about how your baby sleeps&#8230;they are fine, and will get the sleep they need in some form or another. And then they change! Now Elka LOVES the pram!</p>\n<p>Night sleeps started beautifully for us. I was still up a few times, but co-slept, so did a quick feed, and usually fell asleep again straight away, or during. As mentioned, encouraging Elka to get to sleep in the first part of the night was always a bit of a fiasco. She squirmed like crazy, and was obviously desperately uncomfortable lying down and lying still. She screamed like crazy too. I rocked, I bounced, I swaddled tightly, and I sang vigorously. Leonard Cohen&#8217;s\u00a0<em>Hallelujah</em>\u00a0proved particularly favourable, and went round and round my head every waking moment.</p>\n<p>Eventually a baby hammock helped the proceedings, by creating a little cosy nest the snuggled my baby up. If I was a baby, I think that&#8217;s what I would like too. And so every night that&#8217;s what I told myself&#8230;and I took every night as it came, never exasperating, and always ready for the next rock, bounce and sing duty.</p>\n<p>Months in, still feeding every two to three hours, and sometimes more frequently, I wondered why and for how long. After a call out to mums on facebook, and ordering way to many mums of baby self help books, I returned to the path of least resistance, and found that&#8217;s where I was most comfortable. Being easy with how things go. And just tonight, after dinner, a bath, a feed and a mini rendition of\u00a0<em>Hallelujah</em>, Elka fell asleep on her own in the dark on her sheepskin near my bed.</p>\n<p>No crying, just immense amounts of patience, and very gently easing Elka from sling to wherever she needs to get to next.</p>\n", "post_id": 19, "location": false, "date": "06-04-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["parenting", "guest post", "mummy's miracles", "two children"], "text": "<p><em>Lovely Renay from <a href=\"http://www.mummysmiracles.com/\">Mummy&#8217;s Miracles</a> graciously accepted my invitation to do a guest post for Heart Mama.

My husband was coming down with a nasty illness from eating something he probably shouldn&#8217;t have had and we were sitting in a mini bus, heading back to our resort. It was terribly hot and out of the blue said to me, &#8220;So, when we get home, maybe we should start thinking about having a baby&#8221;.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:small;\">I wondered if it was because he was unwell. But no, after we returned home, he still hadn&#8217;t changed his mind.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:small;\">It took 11 months and two miscarriages before I fell pregnant with my now 4-year-old daughter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:small;\">I can&#8217;t say the pregnancy was joyous; more fraught with fear and worry. But then she arrived. My beautiful blue-eyed girl, wrapped in towels was handed to me and she was perfect.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:small;\">I just lay there staring at her, trying to still convince myself that she was mine. She didn&#8217;t cry, she just gazed back.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:small;\">Love at first sight.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:small;\">I hadn&#8217;t had a chance to think about what sort of parent I would be during my pregnancy. And now all of a sudden, I had a baby. But we all figured it out together. I didn&#8217;t read books or manuals. I just went with what worked for us. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:small;\">I can&#8217;t say that night times are always easy in this house. Both my girls are co-sleepers. But that is what works here. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:small;\">For me there is nothing better than the time I get to spend with my big girl at night. Quiet time where we read books and sing songs. And once she falls asleep, I can&#8217;t help but stay in her room with her for a little while longer. Watching her sleep. Making sure her hair isn&#8217;t in her eyes and marvelling at how soft her skin is. Praying that I don&#8217;t make too many mistakes on my parenting journey and hoping that she grows up thinking that I did a good job of it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:small;\">She will be the first of my children to experience all of life&#8217;s ups and downs. The one that bore the brunt of my inexperience. But as we grow together, one of my most treasured gifts is the friendship we are now creating. I love it when she tells me that I&#8217;m her best friend. It makes me realise that in her eyes, what I do is right. Even if we have to have cross words, we are still friends. When we are all tired and grumpy, we are still friends. When I have to take the old band-aid off and put a clean one on, we are still friends. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:small;\">And in my heart, that is how I hope it stays forever.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:small;\"><i><b>Mummy&#8217;s Miracles x</b></i></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://heartmama.net/?attachment_id=1904\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1904\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1904\" alt=\"Renay\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/renay.jpg?w=113&#038;h=150\" height=\"150\" width=\"113\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>J<a href=\"http://heartmama.net/?attachment_id=1904\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1904\"></a>oin Renay at Mummy&#8217;s Miracles on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/mummysmiracles?fref=ts\">Facebook</a>,\u00a0and read more from her blog <a href=\"http://www.mummysmiracles.com/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em>Please join me at the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/heartmamaxx?fref=ts\">Heart Mama Community</a> on Facebook</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">{Linking with Jess for IBOT at <a href=\"http://essentiallyjess.com/\">Essentially Jess</a>.}</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "post_id": 1902, "location": false, "date": "12-03-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["feature post", "mumgo", "children", "siblings", "parenting"], "text": "<div style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.mumgo.com.au/images/blogs/JealouGirl_250x250.jpg\" height=\"250\" width=\"250\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a href=\"https://www.mumgo.com.au/blog.php?article=974\">Image source</a></p></div>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<p>The bringing home of a new baby is a joyous occasion.

A bit like what boys do, given half the chance.</p>\n<p>But that&#8217;s just it. He&#8217;s never given half a chance. I don&#8217;t think, in the six or more years we have been together he has ever done this, even though music is his life.</p>\n<p>And the reason is&#8230;</p>\n<p><strong>Men don&#8217;t have friends</strong></p>\n<p>according to a Women&#8217;s Weekly article I read a few months ago. The article suggested that while women typically surround themselves with people, it is rare for men to hang out with mates after having families.</p>\n<p>Of course, I couldn&#8217;t agree completely with the article &#8211; there are plenty of men out there, hanging with their mates. Surely. And I didn&#8217;t agree with the assertion that the reason men don&#8217;t have friends is because women partners don&#8217;t allow it. This is a ridiculous suggestion. We are generous, gracious beings. On the whole.</p>\n<p>But it did make me think of people we know. Many of the guys we know don&#8217;t have a lot of friends, and if they do, they don&#8217;t have a lot of time to spend with them. Work and family commitments take up a <em>lot </em>of time, and if you are a baby carrying, co-sleeping, dinner-making dad, chances are you have zero to no &#8216; free&#8217; time.</p>\n<p>At some point, Gregor played a few evening games of tennis with the lads. That worked well. I put Elka to sleep, and he and the boys hit balls around in the twilight. Followed by an obligatory beer.</p>\n<p>But the games fizzled out. Now with a second child, it is impossible to imagine him sneaking out for a hit of tennis. When? How? <em>Why? (when there is still washing up to do, laundry to fold and only two hours to spend with your lovely wife, whom you haven&#8217;t had half a moment to talk to all day.)</em><i><br />\n</i></p>\n<p>It isn&#8217;t pressure from me that keeps him at work or at home. It&#8217;s simply lack of time.</p>\n<p>I spend most of my days with friends.</p>\n<p><strong>A day with friends is a day well spent.</strong></p>\n<p>It works with children. We get to have adult conversation, and kids get to have kid <del>conversations</del> jumping games. When I am not with friends, I am sending a quick message to one, on Skype to another, or at least thinking about someone. <a href=\"http://www.columbiaconsult.com/pubs/v52_fall07.html\">Ginny O&#8217;Brien (2008)</a> writes that:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Females begin studying faces as babies, which shapes their brain development. Research demonstrates that the skills of baby girls in making eye contact and facial gazing increases over 400% in the first three months of life, while facial gazing skills in boys doesn&#8217;t. In one study, year-old girls looked at their mothers faces 10 to 20 times more than boys checking for signs of approval or disapproval. While the boys, driven by testosterone, moved around the room to investigate their environment and rarely glanced at their mothers.</p>\n<p>During puberty, oestrogen progesterone, and testosterone continue influencing development. Teenage girls, flooded with oestrogen get stressed around relationships and ease their fear by banning together and being socially connected. Yes, they can be mean and use their language skills &#8211; passive aggressive rumour spreading &#8211; to undermine rivals in their competition for the boys (from an evolutionary perspective sexual competition is part of the survival mechanism). But they can apologize and re-bond when necessary.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Biology suggests that women are programmed to be social. Men are programmed to compete, protect and provide.</p>\n<p>Is this why men don&#8217;t have &#8211; or don&#8217;t need to have &#8211; friends in the same way women do?</p>\n<p>But seeing the joy in Gregor&#8217;s face as he talked about going to his friend&#8217;s place to play music this evening made me realise how important it is for men to have men bonds. They need other men to talk with, be with, play sport against, play music with. Whatever men do (not entirely sure).</p>\n<p>Although there is no extra time in our lives outside of hunting, gathering, protecting and watching comedy shows on the iPad together at the end of the night, I will endeavour to grant Gregor, and insist he has, Bro Time in the future.</p>\n<p><em>Do you (if you are a bro) or your male partners have bro time?

There was an internal switch, which flipped between awesome mode and torture. Life was summit or life was the depths of the pit. It was exhausting. And down in the pit, I looked to the sunny sky above me &#8211; that&#8217;s where I wanted to be. That was\u00a0<em>life</em>. Where I stood was death. Happiness was my ultimate goal and would drag me from the depths.</p>\n<p>Once again, on the summit, I feared falling. I knew darkness, and I didn&#8217;t want to go there. I wanted endless days of sunshine.</p>\n<p>There was a girl at college with me; a gentle, calm soul. Every morning I asked her how she was, and she replied, &#8220;Not bad.&#8221; Not bad. What was that? It was such a strange idea. <i>Not bad.</i> How can someone be\u00a0<em>not bad?</em>\u00a0Life was either sunshine or darkness.</p>\n<p>So, I aspired to\u00a0<em>not bad</em>, eager to know the secret to this calm and gentle soul. I practiced. I mastered. Day after day, I wandered from the rocky landscape to soft, green rolling hills. There were inclines and declines. Soft clouds, occasionally grey and heavy, floated by. But it was not the exhausting rocky landscape I once climbed.</p>\n<p><strong>Life is not about waiting for the storm to pass. It&#8217;s about learning to dance in the rain.</strong></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1936\" style=\"width: 330px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://heartmama.net/?attachment_id=1936\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1936\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1936\" alt=\"dance\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/dance.jpg?w=320&#038;h=256\" height=\"256\" width=\"320\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a href=\"http://travelinspirecreate.wordpress.com/2012/08/21/dancing-in-the-rain/\">Image source</a></p></div>\n<p>These thoughts have been in my mind recently. As chance would have it, one of my favourite writers from <a href=\"http://enjoylifeforonce.com/2012/12/03/the-enjoy-life-mission-is-not-to-be-happy/\">Enjoy Life For Once </a>shared a post to this exact effect. Jennifer was writing about the pressures of happiness, and the destructiveness of such pressure. As always, her post is not only reflective, it is uplifting. She writes about how to embrace the crevices of our life; of ourselves.</p>\n<p>She writes about knowing yourself. If you know that dishes are frustrating and upsetting, know that even if the dishes were made of precious materials, you would still find dishes frustrating and upsetting.</p>\n<p>Jennifer writes about learning to dance in the rain.</p>\n<p>If we know our declines, our dishes &#8211; if we acknowledge &#8211; we can learn to include these parts into our life. We no longer edit them out. Leave them at the door. We instead welcome them in, nod towards them, thank them for being there and know they will help us grow as humans. In doing so, our pits of despair become a meandering decline, which we know will at some point become either flat, or will incline once more towards the sunshine and the soft, green grass at the top of the hill. A gentle meander up, and down.</p>\n<p><strong>How does this relate to our children?</strong></p>\n<p>We, as parents, are creating a template for our child. They are who they are, and will be who they will be, with their own journey. But we are laying down the foundations for them to build upon.</p>\n<p>By embracing negative parts of ourselves, we show our children that it is OK to do so. We demonstrate to our children that pain is part of life, and we can help them move through it.</p>\n<p><strong>A child&#8217;s pain is a mother&#8217;s greatest sadness.</strong></p>\n<p>Watching our children suffer is painful. We long to help them and take their pain away. Unfortunately, apart from kissing it better, so often it is impossible to take the pain away. But we can show our children how to accept pain and suffering as part of our life. We can show them that it is not scary, and that even though we feel pain in this moment, we will soon feel better.</p>\n<p>If we fight in front of our children, we can show them how we make up.</p>\n<p>If we lose our temper, and yell, we can become vulnerable and reveal our pain for our children to see. Apologise and acknowledge our feeling. Acknowledge how our children feel when we yell.</p>\n<p>If we need to cry, we can cry in front of our children. Our children learn that a smile soon follows, and that even mummies cry.</p>\n<p>As parents, we can accept all shades of ourselves and our experiences. We can show our children that pain is a part of life and that dancing in the rain is a beautiful thing to do and will help us grow.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Please join me for Heart Monday.

(Shucks, I have tears).</p>\n<p>Firstly, I would like to thank my husband, for providing 50% of the genetic material as well as being a huge support during, and after the birth. He has stuck with me through the endless bitching, the hormone drops, the crying&#8230;the lack of intimacy. He has done the cooking and dishes just about every night. He has been a kind and consistent father to my older daughter, easing her through a difficult transition. So, thank you.</p>\n<p>Thank you to big sister Elka for taking on this huge change, unrequested. She has been relentlessly entertaining through it all. Loving. Adoring. Providing copious kisses. Her world has been rocked, and although she has tested a few boundaries, and has now decided to use Eve&#8217;s sleep time as play-with-mummy-time and if-I-don&#8217;t-get-what-I-want-squeal-loudly time, she has endured this enormous change famously.</p>\n<p>Thank you to my mum &#8211; amazing mum, who stayed over nights before the birth in case I went into labour. Who slept in a bed with Elka nights Gregor worked following the birth. Who has entertained Elka, cuddled Eve and made sure I always had a cup of tea. Thank you to Dad as well for providing general grandfatherly love and affection.</p>\n<p>Thank you to the numerous friends &#8211; you know who you are &#8211; who popped over to keep me company and brought me news of the outside world. Who made me lunch and tea. Folded my washing, did my dishes, put my house back into order. Thank you to those who brought around cloth nappies and all sorts of necessary items. Thank you thank you.</p>\n<p>Oh, really gushing up now!</p>\n<p>Thank you to my sister-in-law for the nappies and maternity wear. Essential.</p>\n<p>Thank you for all the gorgeous presents for both girls, and the phone calls of congratulations.</p>\n<p>Thank you to the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/heartmamaxx\">Heart Mama Facebook community</a> for all your comments and support.</p>\n<p>Thank you to the mid-wives, who took me through prenatal care and gave me the space to have the most beautiful birth.</p>\n<p>And last but not least, thank you to my precious girl, Eve, for being the most amazing, accommodating, gentle baby I could have wished for.</p>\n<p>Raising children takes a village.

That should be one of the things you include in a baby book. I know that at Christmas last year, not even two, she stood beside my Uncle Paul way after her bed time and lead eighteen of us in nursery rhyme after nursery rhyme. After each one, she demanded\u00a0<em>More!</em> And so it went &#8211; baa baa after twinkle twinkle until she collapsed in a state of post nursery rhyme bliss.</p>\n<p>Australian children&#8217;s author,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.memfox.com/goodnight-sleep-tight.html\">Mem Fox, says</a> that if a child knows six nursery rhymes by heart before the age of four, there&#8217;s a fairly good chance the child will be a great reader by the age of eight. Not that I particularly mind if Elka can read or not by the time she is eight (I&#8217;m a bit of a un-schooler at heart), I think she&#8217;s well on her way to being an avid reader, if Mem&#8217;s prediction is true.</p>\n<p>There is something potent about nursery rhymes; strange little stories that they are. How about\u00a0<em>See-saw Margery Daw. Johnny should have a new master. He should have but a penny a day because he can&#8217;t work any faster</em>? A little mean. Poor Johnny. This was obviously written before the French Revolution. Or\u00a0<em>Rock-a-bye baby on the tree top. When the wind blows, the cradle will rock. When the bough breaks, the cradle will fall. Down will come baby, cradle and all.\u00a0</em>I can never bring myself to sing it aloud.</p>\n<p>Of all the books (wonderful books) Elka has on her book shelf, the one we return to night after night is the book of nursery rhymes. The rhymes are simple. Easy to remember. (Completely unethical). Most of them are recited on CDs we listen to in the car or are performed on <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/abcforkids/sites/playschool/\">Playschool.</a>\u00a0I cringe reading them &#8211; but Elka loves them.</p>\n<p>Mem Fox wrote\u00a0<em>Good Night, Sleep Tight</em>\u00a0 in 1988 to help children engage with nursery rhymes so they may potentially remember at least six before the age of four. The book has been re-created and released this year.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/2.bp.blogspot.com/--BzNyubU778/UH1NZr-gMsI/AAAAAAAAAZw/HVUYyfs6ffE/s1600/good+night+sleep+tight.gif\" /></p>\n<p>Judy Horacek, who illustrated one of Mem Fox&#8217;s most popular books,\u00a0<em>The Green Sheep</em>, has breathed fresh life into\u00a0<em>Good Night, Sleep Tight.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a beautiful, simple read. Skinny Doug, the favourite babysitter, recites nursery rhymes to Bonnie and Ben &#8211; two sleepy children. And the best part it, after you have read it once, you barely have to read it again, if the nursery rhymes are already familiar. You simply need to turn the pages, and the images prompt your memory so that the rhyme can fall playfully from your tongue.</p>\n<p>I asked Elka &#8211; the best critic I know &#8211; for a verdict. She replied:\u00a0<em>Read it again.</em> You can&#8217;t get a better credential.</p>\n<p>Later that evening, she was sitting on the couch, alone,\u00a0<em>Good Night, Sleep Tight\u00a0</em>in lap. She is nearly three, and she was reciting the book cover to cover. Her love of the good old-fashioned nursery rhyme has primed her well for this lovely book.</p>\n<p><em>Do you have a favourite Mem Fox book?\u00a0</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong><em>And please join me at the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/heartmamaxx\">Heart Mama Community</a>\u00a0on Facebook.</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">{Linking with Jess at <a href=\"http://essentiallyjess.com/\">Essentially Jess</a> for the last IBOT of the year.}</p>\n", "post_id": 1948, "location": false, "date": "12-17-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["feature post", "mumgo", "christmas"], "text": "<div id=\"attachment_1953\" style=\"width: 413px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://heartmama.net/2012/12/15/feature-post-at-mumgo-the-spirited-christmas/mumgo/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1953\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1953\" alt=\"Image source\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/mumgo.jpg?w=403&#038;h=403\" width=\"403\" height=\"403\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a href=\"http://www.mumgo.com.au\">Image source</a></p></div>\n<p align=\"justify\">It&#8217;s two weeks into December.

It took us to Europe in May, so we could visit Gregor&#8217;s family. Pregnant and encumbered with a two-year-old, travelling was surprisingly easy. And the bond between Elka her 86-year-old Austrian great-grandfather was worth every cent and drop of energy.</p>\n<p>The year went on &#8211; busy. My blogging blossomed, and I was asked to write for <a href=\"http://www.mumgo.com.au\">Mumgo</a> each week, which was an unexpected, exciting opportunity. Between Gregor and I, we worked insane hours. He&#8217;d come home from one of his three jobs and I would have to work. I worked on Heart Mama in the evenings. We rarely had a day off between us. Meanwhile, I was pregnant and we were raising a toddler.</p>\n<p>Eve was born in October. A Libran, as planned. She slotted in like any Libran would &#8211;\u00a0seamlessly,\u00a0 gracefully, with ease. She continues to lie there, quietly gazing, as chaos erupts around her.</p>\n<p>Elka became a big sister and an almost three-year-old at the same time. She&#8217;s experiencing changes, and we are experiencing changes as she experiences more change. This is growth.</p>\n<p>I asked Elka who is coming next Tuesday to bring her presents.<br />\n&#8220;Granny Annie!&#8221; she exclaimed.<br />\n&#8220;Not Santa?&#8221;<br />\n&#8220;No! He&#8217;s too scar-wy.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Granny Annie arrives next Tuesday, and that&#8217;s a wrap for the year.</p>\n<p>I am going to take a little breather from blogging and work and just be with my delightful little family as we enjoy a week&#8217;s break together.</p>\n<p>Joy, peace and all things beautiful to you all this festive season. See you in the New Year.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://heartmama.net/?attachment_id=1976\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1976\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-1976\" alt=\"Christmas photo\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/christmas-photo.jpg?w=491&#038;h=416\" width=\"491\" height=\"416\" /></a></p>\n<p>Love Zanni, Heart Mama</p>\n<p>xx</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong><em>Please join me at the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/heartmamaxx\">Heart Mama Community</a>\u00a0on Facebook.</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">{Linking with<a href=\"http://withsomegrace.com\"> Grace for FYBF</a>}</p>\n", "post_id": 1975, "location": false, "date": "12-20-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["baby", "parenting", "older child", "children", "learning"], "text": "<div id=\"attachment_1986\" style=\"width: 490px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://heartmama.net/?attachment_id=1986\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1986\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1986 \" alt=\"Flower crown craft\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/flower-wreath.jpg?w=480&#038;h=319\" width=\"480\" height=\"319\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Flower crown craft</p></div>\n<p>If you have been following Heart Mama for the last few months, or reading my posts for <a href=\"www.mumgo.com.au\">Mumgo</a>, you will know that we have recently welcomed a baby, <a href=\"http://heartmama.net/2012/10/18/eve-birth-story/\">Eve Rose</a>, into our home, and Little Elka has become Big Sister Elka. It&#8217;s a huge transition for any small person to make.</p>\n<p>Elka hasn&#8217;t ever been jealous of her baby sister. She loves her and is mostly kind towards her. But there have been changes in my relationship with Elka. I <a href=\"http://heartmama.net/2012/09/25/dear-elka/\">anticipated this</a>, and I have <a href=\"http://heartmama.net/2012/10/11/the-meaning-of-eve/\">grieved the time</a> we spent together &#8211; just the two of us.</p>\n<p>The first few nights, lying with baby Eve in a separate bed to the rest of the family, I missed sharing a bed with Elka &#8211; cuddling up with her &#8211; her little hand on my face. I missed being able to play games with her spontaneously through the day. I missed strange things, like being able to take her to the toilet, because I was breastfeeding.</p>\n<p>She adapted amazingly to her new role, and took to asking others to help her with things like going to the toilet. She asks adult friends she trusts to take her swimming. She goes on play dates with people she knows, without resistance. I have been proud of her, but I have found some changes hard.</p>\n<p>For instance, ever-obliging and cooperative Elka has taken to saying &#8216;no&#8217; to many things. I ask her to do something or not to do something, and she often does the opposite. When she is over-tired or hungry she has emotional outbursts I have no idea how to respond to. All these changes have come with age, but I also feel that the shift in our relationship and our connection has contributed.</p>\n<p><strong>Some days, I don&#8217;t feel connected.</strong></p>\n<p>Some days, she&#8217;ll ask Gregor to take her to bed, instead of me. This is new. Some days, she pushes me away. Some days, she won&#8217;t let me kiss her hurt better. Admittedly, I don&#8217;t take rejection well &#8211; although I am working on how I respond.</p>\n<p>The hardest week was the mad lead up to Christmas. Dragging her around the shops with baby Eve was difficult. For the first time ever, we couldn&#8217;t sit at a cafe with her, because her melt downs were &#8216;unsocial&#8217;. I found myself one part sorry for her and one part mad with her.</p>\n<p><strong>Our connection had shifted.</strong></p>\n<p>I longed for her friendship and our\u00a0comradeship. \u00a0We have been a team, she and I, and that week, I felt we split. Since, I have paid special attention to our connection.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Ten ways to connect with the older child</strong></em></p>\n<p><em>1. I hug her when I can. Sometimes, she pushes me away, but the offer is always there </em></p>\n<p><em>2. I put more effort into constructing activities she will enjoy, particularly craft</em></p>\n<p><em> 3. I read to her while breastfeeding Eve, or at least engage in a conversation with her </em></p>\n<p><em>4. I look her directly in the eyes, as much as I can </em></p>\n<p><em>5. When she&#8217;s emotional, I observe my own emotional reaction, and try to respond like an adult </em></p>\n<p><em>6. I try and see the world from her perspective </em></p>\n<p><em>7. I engage her as much as possible in baby-related activities, like changing nappies </em></p>\n<p><em>8. I have moved back to the family bed </em></p>\n<p><em>9. I put on music we both enjoy and sing and dance and do emu impersonations &#8211; we laugh </em></p>\n<p><em>10. I run back home in the rain, carrying her, showering her in kisses &#8211; the two of us laughing. I love you. I love you. I love you.</em></p>\n<p>As my wise husband says, with every challenge is an opportunity to grow. Children are our greatest teachers, and if we pay attention to their lessons, we can become better people. I love her with every gram of my being. She glows with a lightness, which is contagious &#8211; a lightness and joy, which makes grandparents weak at the knees and stops strangers in the street.</p>\n<p>Taking the time to reconnect has been important to our relationship. Since Christmas, we have had more fun together, I have had more tolerance, and there has been more harmony in the sunshine house.</p>\n<p><em>What ways do you connect with your child when there is a disconnect?</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong><em>Please join me at the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/heartmamaxx\">Heart Mama Community</a>\u00a0on Facebook.</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Linking with Jess for IBOT at <a href=\"http://essentiallyjess.com/\">Essentially Jess</a></p>\n", "post_id": 1982, "location": false, "date": "01-14-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Alice in Wonderland party", "birthday", "feather and lace creative cakes", "New Years Day"], "text": "<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1992\" alt=\"janine cake\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/janine-cake.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=826\"   /></p>\n<p>Today was Elka&#8217;s third birthday &#8211; Elka in Wonderland.

Here are her adventures, weaning her boy and discovering baby-led weaning.</em></p>\n<p><b>A learning curve as steep as the south face of Everest</b></p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know about other mums, but I found the weaning process extremely stressful and I was totally unprepared for the challenge of introducing solids. Admittedly, I was not able to breastfeed Seb and so had not gone through the stress of breastfeeding in the early months as a new mummy (and if my five days of trying to breastfeed are anything to go by, it definitely would have been a cause of great anxiety for me), so perhaps I was less prepared than most.</p>\n<p>I started weaning Seb at 17 weeks on the advice of our pediatrician and, as Seb had such a good appetite, I expected him to devour whatever solid food I gave to him at the first opportunity. \u00a0I was initially armed with Gina Ford&#8217;s &#8216;The Contented Little Baby Book of Weaning&#8221; and I methodically set about drawing up a weaning schedule for the first month based on her recommendations. \u00a0I managed to pick up a combined steamer/food processor at my local Aldi for a fraction of the cost of some of the other brands I had seen, and I felt secretly confident that I was going to get through the weaning stage unscathed with my comprehensive array of equipment.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/blw1.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2072\" alt=\"BLW1\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/blw1.jpg?w=226&#038;h=150\" width=\"226\" height=\"150\" /></a></p>\n<p>We started out with baby rice and gradually introduced pureed pear and apple. The problems started though when I tried feeding Seb pureed carrot and sweet potato as he simply refused to eat it&#8230;.and preferring him to eat something rather than nothing, I reverted to pureed fruit at most meal times. \u00a0I could sometimes disguise the pureed vegetables by mixing them together with a generous quantity of apple or pear puree, a trick used by Rafferty&#8217;s Garden and the other baby food manufacturers (which explains why Seb would happily eat the shop-bought food pouches).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/blw2.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2073\" alt=\"BLW2\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/blw2.jpg?w=169&#038;h=226\" width=\"169\" height=\"226\" /></a><span style=\"font-size:13px;line-height:19px;\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>Mr G would come home from work to a deflated wife who, after spending hours on the weekend preparing a variety of homemade purees, had been unsuccessful in getting Seb to eat anything other than his favourite baby rice with fruit puree or a baby yoghurt. \u00a0Mr G never really understood why I got so stressed about Seb&#8217;s refusal to eat vegetables or meat and would roll his eyes at the sight of me surrounded by weaning books, pen and paper in hand, attempting to come up with new meal plans and feeding strategies. I tried to start each week with a positive outlook but I can&#8217;t deny that it was extremely disheartening when I failed to make any progress by the end of the week, especially when all of Seb&#8217;s peers were happily eating a variety of pureed fruits and vegetables with no issues (I know you shouldn&#8217;t compare to other babies, but sometimes it&#8217;s hard not to). I attended a two-hour solids workshop run by <a href=\"http://www.tuck-shop.com.au\">Tuckshop</a> in an attempt to overcome my weaning woes and whilst it was a very informative session and provided a great introduction to weaning, I was still unsure how to get Seb&#8217;s feeding back on track after our bumpy start.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/blw3.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2074\" alt=\"BLW3\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/blw3.jpg?w=226&#038;h=150\" width=\"226\" height=\"150\" /></a></p>\n<p>I built up a pretty comprehensive library of weaning books as a result of my weaning struggles. I kept hoping that the next book would be the one to solve all my weaning problems, and all that I really ended up doing was bombarding myself with masses of conflicting information. It felt as though I was missing essential pieces of the weaning jigsaw, and I had to take snippets of information from all of the different books in order to come up with the complete picture. It probably comes down to the fact that every child is so unique that there cannot be a &#8216;one size fits all&#8217; solution when it comes to weaning, but I still believe that there is a genuine lack of practical weaning information for new parents.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/blw4.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2075\" alt=\"BLW4\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/blw4.jpg?w=226&#038;h=150\" width=\"226\" height=\"150\" /></a></p>\n<p>I am not sure of the exact moment when I decided to abandon pureed food, but I had heard of Baby-led Weaning (BLW) and dismissed it as being too &#8220;new-age&#8221; for a traditionalist like me. After doing some research on BLW and speaking to friends that had adopted this approach to weaning, I concluded that it was definitely worth a try and it would, at the very least, give me a temporary reprieve from my weaning anxiety. So I ordered a copy of the Gill Rapley\u2019s Baby-led weaning book and bid farewell to my supply of homemade purees in the freezer.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/blw5.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2076\" alt=\"BLW5\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/blw5.jpg?w=169&#038;h=226\" width=\"169\" height=\"226\" /></a></p>\n<p>The clean-freak inside of me was very anxious about the mess involved with BLW (especially given that we live in a rented apartment with cream carpets throughout) so I went out and bought a splash mat for underneath Seb&#8217;s high chair. We then started to experiment with carrot batons, broccoli florets and roasted sweet potato fingers. \u00a0I was warned about the highly sensitive &#8220;gag reflex&#8221; in babies that is often mistaken for choking, and it was very distressing to watch Seb struggle to master the skill of chewing and swallowing.\u00a0 I should point out though, that it never bothered Seb when he gagged and he would simply carry on where he left off once the offending piece of food had been expelled. Just as I was starting to question whether BLW was the right thing for us, Sebastian gradually stopped gagging and instead started to spit out food when it was too big for him to swallow.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/blw6.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2077\" alt=\"BLW6\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/blw6.jpg?w=226&#038;h=150\" width=\"226\" height=\"150\" /></a></p>\n<p>I am so glad that I stuck at BLW during those first couple of weeks as it would have been very easy to give up when my little man appeared to be struggling so much. \u00a0But you do have to trust that gagging is a safety feature that prevents your baby from choking, and it is their means of learning how to handle food. You just have to keep reminding yourself of this when you are feeling at your weakest, and also remember that it will be over within a few weeks. Before you know it your baby will be confidently chewing and swallowing finger foods.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/blw7.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2078\" alt=\"BLW7\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/blw7.jpg?w=226&#038;h=226\" width=\"226\" height=\"226\" /></a></p>\n<p>Seb seems to love the independence of feeding himself and it is so cute to see him squeezing and prodding new foods before having a taste. He really will try anything and surely it&#8217;s every parents&#8217; dream to see their baby happily munching on a broccoli floret.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/blw8.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2079\" alt=\"BLW8\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/blw8.jpg?w=169&#038;h=226\" width=\"169\" height=\"226\" /></a></p>\n<p>I still think that I will start out with homemade baby purees when I start weaning Baby #2 and I will be much more careful about introducing pureed fruit in the early stages of weaning. \u00a0I have also learnt some important lessons from my weaning experience with Seb and I would hope to be much calmer second time around. \u00a0I think this quote perfectly sums up my feelings about weaning now that I have come out the other side&#8230;&#8221;Gauge your child&#8217;s wellbeing by their happy demeanour, regular sleeping patterns and overall good health, not necessarily by the quantity of food that passes their lips&#8221;.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/blw9.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2080\" alt=\"BLW9\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/blw9.jpg?w=226&#038;h=150\" width=\"226\" height=\"150\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong></strong><strong>About Sarah</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/sarahgrose.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-2081\" style=\"border:6px white;\" alt=\"sarahgrose\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/sarahgrose.jpg?w=119&#038;h=150\"   /></a>My name is Sarah and I live in Sydney, Australia with my wonderful husband and my \u00a0 gorgeous son Sebastian.

It is very disappointing to unwrap your new purchase, only be inebriated by the toxic smell.</p>\n<p>The first purchase of something smelly was boxing day last year. It&#8217;s a bit of a long and boring story, but basically, on boxing day, I decided to make bean bags for Elka&#8217;s reading corner, so bought a load of colourful canvas from Spotlight. Of course, you need styrofoam balls to fill bean bags, which I bought from Big W. I then went back, as I decided making the bags was\u00a0a big hassle, and they sold \u00a0inexpensive, funky red velvet &#8220;heart&#8221; chairs, which required about three bags of styrofoam balls each. So between the fabric, the bags themselves and the balls, it was an expensive affair. Then there was the fiasco of pouring millions of feather light balls into bags without spilling any &#8211; visions of tiny white toxic balls suffocating our daughter filled us with fear. But I was happy with the outcome. Two delightful red heart chairs on which to sit and read a book.</p>\n<p>About a week later, I realised that every time I sat on a heart chair, I got a headache. Every time I entered the living room for that matter I got a headache. The culprits were the \u00a0heart chairs and their toxic innards.</p>\n<p>In a huff, Greg and I piled the heart chairs into the car, and headed to Big W. I played the sickly wife holding child, and Greg the assertive male, and between us, we tried to convince various Big W staff that the bags were very smelly and were the cause of my headaches. The staff took turns giving us patronising looks as they put their noses in to smell the styrofoam. &#8220;I don&#8217;t smell anything&#8221;, they would say. Eventually they took it to the manager, who took it back to the assistant manager, and as it turns out there is a \u00a0policy that states that any item that causes illness or pain to the customer can be returned. I only had the receipt for the bags, and couldn&#8217;t convince the various managers and staff that the bags were useless to us without the balls. In protest, we ended up leaving \u00a0both sets of heart chairs and their balls on the counter, as we couldn&#8217;t get any money back.</p>\n<p>I told you it was a long and boring story. Anyway, the moral was although we had wasted all that money I vowed never to have that toxic crap in my house again.</p>\n<p>Then, the other day, I bought a shelving storage unit that hangs in the cupboard&#8230;and it <em>stinks</em>! Honestly, I am not hypersensitive to these things, but it smells very much like petrol. The cupboard smelt, the room smelt. Eventually I turned it outside, sprayed it with essential oil, wiped it down, and after two days airing, it smells just as bad.</p>\n<p>Who knows what they spray these innocent household items with. The universe is punishing me for not buying locally. Next time I buy a must have from Big W, I am going in with a gas mask, and a very critical judgment.</p>\n", "post_id": 208, "location": false, "date": "07-18-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["original Snow White", "fairy tales", "children's book", "original Little Red Riding Hood", "reading"], "text": "<p><em>This is the first post in the <strong>Nourishing Little Readers</strong><strong>\u00a0</strong>series, which will run on Fridays at Heart Mama.

What&#8217;s it about?</em> and she listens and asks questions and makes changes.\u00a0<em>Just one more,</em> she asks, as the bath gets cold.</p>\n<p>Her favourite tales are\u00a0<em>Little Red Riding Hood</em> and\u00a0<em>Snow White.\u00a0</em>We read so many books, but she so often asks for the classics. They are more than classics; they are archetypes; stories told by peasants in the middle ages. Stories that carried messages, passed from mother to daughter to granddaughter, like wisdom.

She reminded me that the fairy tales we know are watered down.</p>\n<p>The real stories were full of dark themes, complex, dark humanness. When the story was still passed lip to lip, it was Snow White&#8217;s mother, not her step-mother, who wanted her dead. Snow White was only sixteen; a ripening, sexual being. Snow White&#8217;s mother felt threatened by her sexuality. The Queen demanded that a huntsman take Snow White into the woods, and bring back her liver and her lungs as proof of her death. The huntsman couldn&#8217;t bring himself to do it, and brought back the liver and lungs of a boar, which the Queen ate.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2087\" style=\"width: 444px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/434px-schneewittchen2.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2087\" alt=\"Image source\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/434px-schneewittchen2.jpg?w=434&#038;h=599\" width=\"434\" height=\"599\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Schneewittchen2.jpg\">Image source</a></p></div>\n<p>Snow White lived with the seven dwarves who made her clean their house and cook as payment for their protection. The Queen attempted to kill her daughter three times. When she eventually succeeded in killing Snow White, the handsome prince found her coffin. His kiss dislodged the poisoned apple, which had stuck in her throat, and Snow White awakened. They married, and the mother was punished for her evil deeds. She was made to dance for hours in heated iron shoes, until she burnt to death.</p>\n<p>There are different versions. Mostly gruesome. Mostly heeding a warning. Be ware of your jealousy towards your daughter.</p>\n<p>When Little Red Riding Hood was a peasant tale, the little girl wearing a red cape was seduced into her grandma&#8217;s bed by the wolf, who ate her. Grandma didn&#8217;t survive. Red Riding Hood didn&#8217;t either. In other versions, she led the wolf into believing she needed to go to the toilet, and escaped. Little Red Riding Hood was first written down by French author Charles Perrault. In his version, Riding Hood was tricked and killed by the wolf. The story became a moral tale; a warning not to talk to strangers, and to warn villagers of the dangers of the forest.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2088\" style=\"width: 459px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/walter_crane26.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2088\" alt=\"Image source\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/walter_crane26.jpg?w=449&#038;h=600\" width=\"449\" height=\"600\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Red_Riding_Hood\">Image source</a></p></div>\n<p>These stories are tepid when they make it into our children&#8217;s books, though there is horror enough.

It wasn&#8217;t a happy ending.</p>\n<p>Last week, I wrote about storytelling, and its role in our life. Storytelling in the bath, in the car, when things get difficult, when we haven&#8217;t anything else to do. Stories get teeth brushed and pyjamas on.\u00a0 Stories about Red Riding Hood, the Big Bad Wolf, the Three Little Pigs. Stories that are part this world, part books, part imagination.</p>\n<p>Storytelling is a way of nourishing creativity, and to be creative, we must unleash our inner storyteller. As adults, when we write fiction, we need to switch off our analytic &#8216;adult&#8217; brain, and retreat to our childlike stream of consciousness. We have to part ways with judgement and our inner critic, and simply let the story flow through our pen.</p>\n<p>Reading to children, and inventing tales is a beautiful way to nourish creativity. Listen to the stories children tell while they play. If they invite you to, engage in their fantasy world, asking questions.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Connect with a child through stories</em></strong></p>\n<p>Stories are an insight into little minds. They tell us what a child has been reading or watching on television. They may also tell us what a child is thinking or feeling. Complex emotions and thoughts may present themselves in childrens&#8217; stories. Storytelling is a way of communicating, and connecting us all.</p>\n<p>In an article called <em>The Secrets of Storytelling: Why we love a good yarn</em>, Jeremy Hsu (2008) wrote:</p>\n<p><em>Most scientists are starting to agree: stories have such a powerful and universal appeal that the neurological roots of both telling tales and enjoying them are probably tied to crucial parts of our social cognition.</em></p>\n<p>Pam Allyn (2010) writes about the social benefits to storytelling:</p>\n<p><em>Story reminds us that connectedness to the world does not always mean some have more and some have less, but that we all have stories and that is what brings us together. </em></p>\n<p>Nourish storytelling.

As every new\u00a0plateau\u00a0of the parenting landscape is reached, we pause, collect our thoughts and get our bearings. We need to be consistent, we decide. We need clear boundaries &#8211; this is OK, and this is not OK. And if the screaming continues until she gets what she wants, then we have to stand our ground. Gentle, kind ground. But we have to stand it.</p>\n<p>This evening, I sat patiently, waiting out the storm.\u00a0<em>I&#8217;m here, when you are ready to brush your teeth</em>, I said. Eve was on my lap. She was patient too. Not a squeak. What must she be thinking.</p>\n<p><em>I love you</em>, I said<em>, but it&#8217;s not OK to scream. You need to stop, and you need to brush your teeth before your jutie*.\u00a0</em>I wanted her to know I was there for her, but I had to stand my ground.</p>\n<p>My inconsistency has been my failing in the past. She wants jutie, I say she can have it after X, she screams, I give her jutie <em>before </em>X\u00a0&#8211; obviously, she learns that screaming is how to get jutie, and if she screams loud enough, jutie will be had. I am a push over, I know it. But it&#8217;s possible to be gentle and consistent. It&#8217;s possible, and it&#8217;s better for all of us.</p>\n<p>Recently, I wrote for <a href=\"http://www.raising-humans.com/2013/01/10/growing-together-children-are-our-greatest-teachers-heart-mama/\">Raising Humans&#8217; </a>website about how I felt frustrated and angry when Elka goes into a tail spin. I kept my feelings under wraps, but they were there, burning my insides; punching me from within, trying to get out. I didn&#8217;t let them.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t want to be that angry mother. I don&#8217;t want anger to seep down a generation, into the hearts of my little ones.</p>\n<p>I want peace, so I have to practice peace.</p>\n<p>As it always does, writing down the words\u00a0released my inner anger. The last few days, even when a scream is so loud and irrational it makes you want to knock your head against a wall, I have felt peace. I have felt compassion &#8211; genuine compassion for Elka. I have pained for her &#8211; waiting for the pain to end, for both of us.</p>\n<p>She didn&#8217;t brush her teeth, but she didn&#8217;t get jutie.

It&#8217;s yummy. You try it,&#8221; he will just shake his head and push his plate away.</p>\n<p>The more I try to push it, the harder he will stick his feet in.</p>\n<p>I think, with kids, you have got to choose your battles, and I refuse to battle it out every night at the dinner table.</p>\n<p>So, to get him to try something\u00a0new, I do &#8220;Toddler Tapas&#8221; for dinner.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll put out a little bit of this and a little bit of that and he can choose what he\u00a0wants to put on his plate and eat.</p>\n<p>He feels like he is in control and is choosing to try a\u00a0new food because he wants\u00a0to, not because Mum wants him to.</p>\n<p>I make sure his options are healthy or healthy, and I don&#8217;t put a plate of fruit out, because otherwise he would probably just eat the fruit, and nothing else.</p>\n<p>Charlie&#8217;s\u00a0favourite vegetables are carrot and cucumber so I&#8217;ll cut up a\u00a0plate of each, and then put out something he usually doesn&#8217;t like to eat, like tomato.</p>\n<p>If he hasn&#8217;t tried something like\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.taste.com.au/recipes/21701/devilled+eggs\">Devilled Eggs</a> or <a href=\"http://retromumma.wordpress.com/2013/01/19/corned-beef-silverside-with-djon-white-sauce-2/\">Ginger Beer\u00a0Corned Beef </a>\u00a0before, I put a plate out of each, alongside his favourite vegetables.</p>\n<p>Then, I&#8217;ll toast some bread, and while it&#8217;s still warm, place\u00a0cheese on top, which I then cut up into little pieces. I&#8217;ll serve it on a plate with a little bit of dried sultana and apricot.</p>\n<p>I change the combinations, but essentially what I aim for is at least one serve from each food group.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a very relaxed and fun way to eat dinner and it takes me hardly any time\u00a0at\u00a0all to put together, because the meat I use is leftovers from the night before.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2105\" style=\"width: 402px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/toddler-tapas.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-2105 \" alt=\"Toddler Tapas\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/toddler-tapas.jpg?w=392&#038;h=294\" width=\"392\" height=\"294\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Toddler Tapas</p></div>\n<p>To get\u00a0Charlie to eat something he doesn&#8217;t usually eat, like tomato, I&#8217;ll make mini sandwiches with what&#8217;s on the table.

Although we hastily photograph their creations, or file them away, they don&#8217;t care if their beautiful artwork dissolves. It was the\u00a0<em>making\u00a0</em>which was the magic. The lasting doesn&#8217;t matter much to them.</p>\n<p>This week, we collected pretty petals from the garden in baskets, and stuck them onto coloured paper. I quickly took my camera to them, knowing:\u00a0<em>a</em>. the petals would be blown away and <em>b</em>. the petals would quickly brown and die.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2136\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_20130120_204842_resized1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-2136\" alt=\"Transient flower art\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_20130120_204842_resized1.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=1024\"   /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Transient flower art</p></div>\n<p>My photo-making was irrelevant to Elka.

We know to ignore the flashy food ads on TV, as well as politically correct mainstream endorsements of good health. We understand that packaged foods are usually filled with additives, preservatives &amp; hydrogenated fasts, and we try to avoid food that has hormones, antibiotics and pesticides. We opt instead for a nutritious, healthy diet.</p>\n<p>But I like to take it one step further for my family, improving the quality of their diet by introducing these nutritionally superior foods:</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">1. Grass-fed meat, cheese &amp; butter</span> \u2013 contain good saturated fats (a good concentrated source of energy) and also provide the building blocks for cell membranes and hormones. It has high levels of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugated_linoleic_acid\">conjugated linoleic acid</a> (CLA\u2019s) which help to fight cancer and prevent diabetes. Grass-fed products are richer in antioxidants and don\u2019t contain hormones, antibiotics or other drugs.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">2. Pastured chicken and eggs</span> \u2013 have higher amounts of Omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin A,D and E, folic acid a than grain-fed poultry, plus important anti-oxidants (including CLA). They have less fat, fewer calories and less cholesterol too.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">3. Raw milk</span> \u2013 is<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogenization_(chemistry)\"> unhomogenised</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteurization\">unpasteurised</a> and super dooper delicious! It is high in vitamins, minerals and enzymes, essential fatty acids and amino acids, and contains beneficial bacteria for the human body. Antibodies found in raw milk provide resistance to many viruses and bacteria.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">4. Pseudo grains</span> \u2013 are seeds and grasses which we commonly think of as grains. They include quinoa, amaranth and buckwheat. They are high in protein, fibre, are gluten-free and easy to digest, absorb and assimilate. Some beneficial minerals they contain are calcium, iron and magnesium. They are best soaked overnight in water with an acid medium (such as salt or apple cider vinegar), then rinsed before cooking to release <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytic_acid\">phytates.</a></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">5. Activated nuts</span> \u2013 are a great source of good monounsaturated fats and protein, but they are difficult to digest due to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytic_acid\">phytic acid</a>. Activate the nuts by soaking them overnight in water with acid medium, then rinse and dry in a very low oven until dry.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">6. Raw Cultured Vegetables</span> \u2013 raw vegetables are <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermentation_(food)\">fermented</a> which and this process improves digestion, strengthens the immune system by \u00a0promoting healthy flora in the intestine. They are loaded with vitamins (like vitamin C and A).</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">7. Coconut Oil</span> &#8211; is a healthy medium chain <a href=\"http://www.westonaprice.org/know-your-fats/skinny-on-fats\">saturated fat</a> and has <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial\">antimicrobial</a> properties. It eases digestion, supports immunity, boosts metabolism and is safe to cook at high temperatures (unlike most other oils).</p>\n<p>I have to admit, I get a warm fuzzy feeling knowing that I am giving my family the best nutrition that I can. That I am providing the best possible start to life for my kids and that their future health will look bright!</p>\n<p>Love and light.</p>\n<p>Bren x</p>\n<p><strong>Biography</strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/dsc_8711.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-2149\" alt=\"DSC_8711\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/dsc_8711.jpg?w=99&#038;h=150\" width=\"99\" height=\"150\" /></a></strong>Brenda Janschek is a qualified holistic health coach, \u00a0speaker and wellness blogger.

Blanky. Stitched with love by my god mother. A patchwork of satin and cotton scraps, patched and re-patched when it was love-worn. I would move it around, while in bed, trying to find the cold bit. The corner that hadn&#8217;t been clutched. When that part was warm, and I would circulate blanky to find a corner still to be loved.</p>\n<p>That was my first memory, though I am still sure Mum was my first love.</p>\n<p>My thumb was a close third. My\u00a0orthodontist didn&#8217;t call this love. Nor did my parents, when they saw the bill for squillions of dollars.</p>\n<p>Soon after those early loves came this:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/very-hungry-caterpillar-book-cover.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-2159\" alt=\"T435 PL REP  FC\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/very-hungry-caterpillar-book-cover.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=713\"   /></a></p>\n<p>and this</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/clive-cover.gif\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-2160\" alt=\"clive-cover\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/clive-cover.gif?w=1024&#038;h=809\"   /></a></p>\n<p>and this.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/winnie-the-pooh.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-2161\" alt=\"winnie-the-pooh\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/winnie-the-pooh.jpg?w=800&#038;h=1024\"   /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These books, among others, gave my little thoughts words and my little ideas pictures. I would take these little words and little ideas and weave magical worlds, where things happened, and people talked. These stories kept me company down the bottom of the paddock, and tucked up in bed with blanky and thumb.</p>\n<p>Later, these stories found their way into a typewriter. I can&#8217;t quite remember, but can imagine six-year-old me sitting straight-backed at Dad&#8217;s typewriter, giving form to my stories. The paper fed out the bottom of the grey machine. The letters clunked heavily under small but conscientious fingers.</p>\n<p>When I was six, I published this:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/fairystory.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-2162\" alt=\"fairystory\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/fairystory.jpg?w=806&#038;h=1024\"   /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/fairystory1.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-2163\" alt=\"fairystory1\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/fairystory1.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=519\"   /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/fairystory2.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-2164\" alt=\"fairystory2\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/fairystory2.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=585\"   /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/fairystory3.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-2165\" alt=\"fairystory3\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/fairystory3.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=589\"   /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There were others stories. On finding this\u00a0<em>anthology</em> last week, I was sucked back to the mind of that girl, sitting at her dad&#8217;s grey typewriter. This is the closest I get to feeling what she felt and thinking what she thought. An imprint. A trace. An icon from six-year-old me, carefully filed away in a green plastic ring binder.</p>\n<p>Those were my loves. That was me, clinging onto a blanky, sucking my thumb, thinking stories.

School. Well, pre-school&#8230;more playing than schooling, but it&#8217;s teachers, and bags and gates&#8230;so technically, it&#8217;s school.</p>\n<p>My little big girl Elka was so excited, she even agreed to brush her hair\u00a0<del>tangles</del> . I almost convinced her to eat her breakfast. She took three bites, just to get her through the morning.</p>\n<p>I know parents reading this will be rolling their eyes &#8211; been there, done that. You probably have put numerous kids through big school by now. And it&#8217;s just another day.</p>\n<p>It was just another day. But my little one sat in the back seat of the car, nibbling her finger. It was an unusual gesture. Despite the Big Girl bravado, I think she was a little concerned.</p>\n<p>After leading her in, meeting the teachers and putting on the uniform broad-brimmed hat, she disappeared into the playground with other children. Five minutes later, she re-appeared.\u00a0<em>I&#8217;m having a great time Mum. Bye!</em> It was as if it was scripted.</p>\n<p>Sitting quietly at home, with my second, far quieter child, it felt &#8211; quiet. We looked at each other, baby and me, and wondered where our noisy companion was when you needed her. I missed her incessant conversation. Her silly stories. Her antics. Her occasional emotional outburst. 1000s of ideas. 1000s of instructions. Eve and I had to think for ourselves. It was weird.</p>\n<p>More than anything though, I felt a little\u00a0saddened\u00a0that this was the first day of fifteen years more. That my little girl is as big as she claims to be. Saddened, but proud as hell.</p>\n<p>Picking her up, I felt prouder still. We nearly messed up the first day pick-up, thinking my husband was doing it; he thinking I was doing it. We very nearly sucked. But I power-walked into town with Eve in the sling and the car seat on the pram to meet Greg in town, and collect Elka. We nearly sucked, but then we didn&#8217;t.</p>\n<p>She was happy to see me. Not relieved or spent. Just pleased.

I woke the next morning, and offered her some mushed avocado &#8211; she ate the whole fruit!</p>\n<p>The avocado was indicative of Elka&#8217;s general style of eating. Most food offered is usually eaten in its entirety and little food gets refused.</p>\n<p>We spoon fed for a while &#8211; the menu included:<br />\nAvocado<br />\nSweet potato<br />\nPumpkin<br />\nVarious grains, like quinoa<br />\nPear<br />\nBanana<br />\nAnd a mix of any of the above.</p>\n<p>At some point I introduced yogurt, at some point some cottage cheese, then some ground beef or chicken.</p>\n<p>Within about two months, I began feeding Elka soft solids &#8211; things like cooked carrot, cooked zucchini, slices of avocado or tomato. Most pieces went into her mouth, and were chewed (Elka grew teeth at two months!) Some went onto the floor &#8211; this is usually an indication of &#8216;Had Enough&#8217; or &#8216;Time to Play&#8217; &#8211; we joke that Elka thinks the floor is a bit hungry. Some days, Elka is apparently more in need of food than the floor.</p>\n<p>I admit I have never read any brochures, pamphlets, books etc about what babies should eat. In the food respect, I really do follow my instinct, and Elka&#8217;s cues. She seems to like most things, and is upset by little, so I am pretty relaxed with what I feed her. Elka probably eats a greater variety of food than most babies in her baby group. My friends tend to follow a more Steiner approach &#8211; introducing foods very slowly, and avoiding things like gluten or dairy for the first year or so. I occasionally feel a little guilty that I am not more fastidious with what Elka puts in her mouth. My approach reflects a little the fact that I am also relaxed about where things Elka puts in her mouth have been. The idea of sterilisation to me is a little taxing, and indeed foreign. I know some parents would find this revolting, but my theorisation goes along the lines of &#8216;the more germs Elka is exposed to, the greater her immunity&#8217;. And so far Elka has barely been sick.<br />\nOf course every parent should do things in their own way, and true to their own beliefs. This is just what works for me and my partner.</p>\n<p>So, in all, we are blessed with a baby who eats enthusiastically, and healthily. One might suggest she inherited her appetite and her gusto for food from her father. In that respect at least, we are pretty certain Elka didn&#8217;t come from the milkman!</p>\n", "post_id": 22, "location": false, "date": "06-04-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p><em>We Lie</em></p>\n<p>We lie, side by side</p>\n<p>As I wait for you to sleep.</p>\n<p>Your small warm hand strokes my cheek.</p>\n<p>Your breath upon my face.</p>\n<p>I close my eyes, pretending, and will you to sleep.</p>\n<p>When I peak, your eyes are open, staring at me.</p>\n<p>In the dim light, all I see is the lamp&#8217;s reflection on your pupils.</p>\n<p>My breath big and slow, yours small and fast, warm the cold room.</p>\n<p>You flick your day away.</p>\n<p>Memories of you seep through me like honey, and I am a golden dream for you to fall asleep to.

Thought of me. Sent me a rose.</p>\n<p>Nothing.</p>\n<p>It was just a rose, but somehow its absence mattered. In my little first world mind, it was the biggest problem in the universe. I couldn&#8217;t get a boyfriend. No-one loves me. Wah.</p>\n<p>It didn&#8217;t help that I was shy with boys. Or that I went to a girl&#8217;s boarding school between the ages of 12-17.

I cared, so much.</p>\n<p>My first love was pretty much unrequited. He played the drums and we sat on the bonnet of his car, talking about writing, and art. After a brief fling, we hung out as friends over a summer, until I couldn&#8217;t bear it any longer, and moved to Melbourne. Thankfully, my self-respect saved me. I had a few more hopeless romances. I didn&#8217;t understand that my innocent, open love for another person could be so easily rejected.</p>\n<p>But love is like that.</p>\n<p>Then\u00a0<em>he</em>\u00a0came along. Tall, greg<em>o</em>rious, funny, smart. At first I was skeptical, and arranged my brother&#8217;s swag for him to sleep on in the living room. I was still skeptical when he swept me under his long arm &#8211;\u00a0<em>come here, come here.\u00a0</em>He told me that he had no intentions of sleeping on the swag, but it was cute that I thought he might.</p>\n<p>I loved straight away that he wasn&#8217;t\u00a0intimidated\u00a0by me. I loved that I couldn&#8217;t offend him. I loved that I knew he liked me, and I didn&#8217;t need to spend a million years guessing. I loved that after a week, he told me he loved me, and that after three, he\u00a0intimated\u00a0that he might move to Australia for me. It wasn&#8217;t weird. It was simple and practical.

And we now know they have a sense of morality.</p>\n<p><em><strong>We can&#8217;t afford not to be kind to our children.</strong></em></p>\n<p>Even at 5-months, our baby judges our behaviour. They know inherently if we are nice to them, nice to their sister and nice to their father. They are not easily fooled, laying like a loaf of bread, letting reality happen around them.</p>\n<p>They are taking in and learning from\u00a0<em>everything.\u00a0</em>In those early years, we are the world from which they learn.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Be the person you want your children to be.</strong></em></p>\n<p>No person is perfect. No parent is perfect &#8211; whatever that means. We are human, like the next.</p>\n<p>Tonight, I threw a picture book across the room because one child demanded me to read, and the other cried when I did. Frustrated and flawed, I was, and I threw.</p>\n<p>But my children were watching. Big brown eyes follow my every movement.</p>\n<p>I balance the act, by softening my voice, and picking up the book.\u00a0<em>Sorry</em>, I mumble.\u00a0<em>I&#8217;m frustrated, that&#8217;s all.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>Apparently, they forgive me. We snuggle in close for the night.\u00a0<em>I will be kinder tomorrow</em>, I say to myself.</p>\n<p>I am not crippled or intimidated by the fact that they need me to be Nice Mum. For me, it&#8217;s as an honour, and an opportunity to grow. I am glad I have to curb my angry, frustrated ways.

What is it about this book, do you think, which has captured the hearts of parents?</b></p>\n<p>I think it might be all the love in the book!\u00a0 I mention again and again the bonding and gorgeousness of reading to our children, which makes the job of reading aloud not a job at all but a treasurable, divine thing to do.\u00a0 And of course any parent wants the best for their children and this book helps to ensure that children have the very best start to reading, long before they go to school. I think parents are their children\u2019s most important teacher but the funny thing is that I never want parents to formally teach their children to read. That\u2019s what this book is about: comforting parents and encouraging them to do their best.</p>\n<p><b></b><b>Can you share with us one of the secrets behind reading magic &#8211; how can children learn to read before school?</b></p>\n<p>The most important thing for parents to remember is to read aloud every night, if possible, to their child at bedtime. Picking the right book is also critical. Parents should choose short books with lots of pictures and lots of rhyme, rhythm or repetition; or a combination of all three. Children learn to love a book more easily through this kind of writing. And that\u2019s the kind of book that leads them to early literacy.</p>\n<p>How parents read is another determining factor in whether their child will be able to read before school. Parents should read in the same lively \u2018tune\u2019 every single time they read to their child. Hang loose!\u00a0 Let go! Don\u2019t be embarrassed to be ALIVE as you read. This will help the child to become familiar with, and remember the story in the same way that they remember adverts on television.</p>\n<p>Parents also need to play games with the things that they and the child can see on the page, such as letting children finish rhymes, and finding the letters that start with the child\u2019s name and theirs. It helps the child learn to focus on the things on the page.</p>\n<p><b></b><b>What is so nourishing about reading aloud to children?</b></p>\n<p>Reading aloud to children makes all the difference to a child\u2019s success in life. When we read aloud to children their brains develop, their language develops and their social skills develop. We bond with them and form life-long, firm attachments, and children learn that reading is hilarious, fantastic and fun. It shocks me that some parents would send their child to school without the child ever picking up a book.</p>\n<p><b></b><b>You are passionate about encouraging parents to read aloud to their children from a young age. Where did this passion spring from?</b></p>\n<p>I became intensely passionate about reading aloud to children early in my career as a teacher. I suddenly realised how switched-on children can be after my own four year old learnt to read after two weeks at school. I don\u2019t patronise children in my books; I respect them as if they were adult readers. I believe that if children know six nursery rhymes by heart by the age of four, they are more likely to be in the top reading group at school by eight. This is why my latest children\u2019s book, <i>Good Night, Sleep Tight</i>, revives seven classic nursery rhymes for new generations.</p>\n<p><b></b><b>Your first book,\u00a0<i>Possum Magic, </i>was one of my favourites as a child, and is now adored by my daughter. What was your inspiration to write this story?</b></p>\n<p>I was inspired to write <i>Possum Magic, </i>kind of indirectly, by daughter, Chloe. She was such an avid reader that I couldn\u2019t keep up with her desire for books. I decided to take a course in children\u2019s literature to discover more books to interest her, particularly those published since my own childhood.</p>\n<p>I wrote <i>Possum Magic</i>, at university in 1978, studying children\u2019s literature. It was actually written for an assignment. I was born here but had grown up in Africa, with a deep love for Australia and everything in it. I wanted to write the most Australian book possible, as there was very little good Australian literature for children at the time. My lecturer thought the book was brilliant, but it was rejected nine times over five years! During that time it was rewritten and then, of course, it was finally published and went on to become a bestselling Australian children\u2019s picture book. It can still be bought in hard back after 30 years, which is amazing.</p>\n<p><b></b><b>What is it about\u00a0<i>Possum Magic, </i>do you think, that\u00a0has captivated so many people from different generations across the world?</b></p>\n<p>I think what makes it so special to readers is its \u2018Australianness\u2019. I am very proud of having written so many Australian books for Australian children. Many of my books are universal, but I think it is important to our national pride to offer kids books which have an Australian flavour.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong><em>Please join me at the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/heartmamaxx\">Heart Mama Community\u00a0on Facebook</a>, and subscribe to receive posts by email if you enjoy reading.</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Sharing with the folk at <a href=\"http://withsomegrace.com\">With Some\u00a0Grace</a></p>\n", "post_id": 2266, "location": false, "date": "02-21-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["housework", "washing", "things I know", "family", "timesaver"], "text": "<p>It was inevitable&#8230;I had to start a\u00a0<em>Nourishing Mamas\u00a0</em>category.

I avoid the timely task of folding washing, but if I can combine it with bringing in washing, giving my little hearts some sunshine and garden time and putting washing away, then folding is just part of the solution.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2272\" style=\"width: 692px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/img_4066.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-2272\" alt=\"Folding washing on mat with baby\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/img_4066.jpg?w=682&#038;h=1024\"   /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Folding washing on mat with baby</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_2273\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/img_4069.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-2273\" alt=\"Neatly(ish) folded washing \" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/img_4069.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=682\"   /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Neatly(ish) folded washing</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_2274\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/img_4070.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-2274\" alt=\"Baby eats grass and messes up undie pile\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/img_4070.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=682\"   /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Baby eats grass and messes up undies pile</p></div>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong><em>Please join me at the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/heartmamaxx\">Heart Mama Community\u00a0on Facebook</a>, and subscribe to receive posts by email if you enjoy reading.</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Linking with:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.saturdaymorningogremum.com/category/blogging/tis-a-meme/things-i-know/\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" alt=\"Things I Know\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.saturdaymorningogremum.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/smom-things-i-know-meme.png\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 2271, "location": false, "date": "02-23-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["tantrums", "gentle parenting", "love", "natural parenting", "family"], "text": "<p>I have been blessed with two beautiful, co-operative daughters. Easy One and Easy Two. I have sailed the parenting dream boat. We have had normal ups and downs, but up until now, being loving and kind towards my daughters has been met with good outcomes.</p>\n<p>We missed the terrible twos. Not sure what they&#8217;re about, but we didn&#8217;t have them. Twos, like ones, and zeros, were dreamy and lovely.</p>\n<p>At three though, Little Heart has found a new groove. One that involves spending large amounts of time lying on the floor, sighing dramatically. Whining. Crying. Thrashing very long limbs about.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s painful to watch.</p>\n<p>Reasons for a meltdown/breakdown/tanty include:</p>\n<p><em></em>Elmo did\u00a0<em>not\u00a0</em>say &#8216;How I wonder what you are!&#8217;<br />\nBut I need another episode!<br />\nI\u00a0<em>don&#8217;t\u00a0</em>need to pee before bed!<br />\nI\u00a0<em>don&#8217;t</em>\u00a0need to eat!<br />\nYou <em>have</em> to find the pink chicken!</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not all floor thrashing. Ninety-nine percent of the time, it&#8217;s sunshine and daisies. She makes us laugh, is affectionate and beautiful.</p>\n<p>She sings songs about Humpty:</p>\n<p><em>Humpty Dumpty doesn&#8217;t want to wear his shoes,<br />\n</em><em>Humpty Dumpty is a cranky noodle.</em></p>\n<p>And tells me that the slippery slide has run out of batteries.</p>\n<p>She knows when she&#8217;s being funny.</p>\n<p>But the one percent of floor thrashing is demoralising. I am never quite sure how to respond, and somehow only manage to make it worse.</p>\n<p>For the first time in my parenting experience, I feel out of control. I can&#8217;t change my daughter&#8217;s experience. No amount of kindness and patience affects the outcome. Maybe it does, but the results are delayed.</p>\n<p>I am frustrated by my lack of control over the situation.\u00a0I\u00a0can&#8217;t<em>\u00a0</em>find the pink chicken anywhere.</p>\n<p>My words no longer make sense&#8230;I can&#8217;t reason myself out of the situation. I can&#8217;t even kiss it better. Or offer jutie. I have no external control mechanisms.</p>\n<p>Frustrating.</p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s OK. When I was in the swings of rock-a-bye-byeing, it felt its own kind of hard. But looking back, it wasn&#8217;t that bad. Time passed, and within minutes, we were onto the next parenting hurdle.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I made you this, because you are all Heart Mamas. And you are awesome.

She&#8217;s pretty damn gorgeous so I don&#8217;t mind at all&#8230;but occasionally I wonder, how am I going to complete my 14 day fitness challenge? I have some words of wisdom for you {with very professional diagrams}. Getting fit with toddler is possible. Here&#8217;s how {note: much of this will also apply to babies}</p>\n<p><strong>1. The pram pusher</strong></p>\n<p>Take one pram, and one small child, and combine. Choose a relatively flat surface, put on your running shoes, and run {oh, and don&#8217;t forget the pram}. Simple. Takes a bit of extra muscle, but the thing is, you don&#8217;t have to go as far, because you are pushing a pram. Extra endurance. We do this as family exercise. Large Dutch father who runs barefoot, tall and <em>extremely\u00a0</em>athletic mother, and small very cute child in pram wearing beanie.</p>\n<p>Benefits: Great way to impress the neighbours. Quality way to spend time with the whole family.</p>\n<p>Tip: Make sure baby is rugged up. Little hands get cold and chilly, especially if the run is early morning.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_231\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/prampusher.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-231\" title=\"prampusher\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/prampusher.jpg?w=300&#038;h=228\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"228\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Pram Pusher</p></div>\n<p><strong>2. The child lifter</strong></p>\n<p>This is just a simple squat plus child. Lift child into a tight hug, stand with generous distance between feet, and bend knees into a deep squat. Repeat until muscles can&#8217;t hack it any longer, and gently lower child.</p>\n<p>Benefits: Toned thighs and bum&#8230;seriously, hottest mum in town! {Don&#8217;t judge by picture}</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_232\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/squat.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-232\" title=\"squat\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/squat.jpg?w=300&#038;h=277\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"277\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Child Lifter</p></div>\n<p><strong>3. The reader</strong></p>\n<p>Take any floor exercise, for example ab crunches, or leg lifts, take one book and have child close by. Crunch. Read. Crunch. Read. Easy.</p>\n<p>Benefits: You are so busy concentrating on the fabulous children&#8217;s book, you don&#8217;t realise you have already done 50 ab crunches. Or you are so busy concentrating on ab crunches that you completely miss the fact that you have just read The Gruffalo for the 200th time.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_233\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/reader.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-233\" title=\"reader\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/reader.jpg?w=300&#038;h=238\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"238\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Reader</p></div>\n<p><strong>4. Backyard blitzer</strong></p>\n<p>Take one ball, one child that can walk, and one back yard. Kick ball lightly to child and while they are busy working out how to kick it back to you, run one lap of the garden.</p>\n<p>Benefits: Great fun, child will love this one.</p>\n<p>Tip: Whenever you are completing one lap of the backyard, run towards child with arms outstretched as if motioning to tickle them. Child should respond with hysterical laughter.</p>\n<p>Warning: Does not apply to babies.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_234\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/backyard.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-234\" title=\"backyard\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/backyard.jpg?w=300&#038;h=282\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"282\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Backyard Blitzer</p></div>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">~</p>\n<p>So mummies, no excuses anymore.

What got sent home this week may be devoured next week and what my child turns his nose up at, yours may devour\u2026..so I\u2019ll give you the run down of everything packed here in case it provides you with inspiration, because sometimes, a little inspiration is all you need.</p>\n<p>Please remember that I\u2019m not doing anything amazing here.

It&#8217;s no big deal. If anything, it&#8217;s a\u00a0<em>finally.</em></p>\n<p>I have always felt older than I am. When I was a kid, it was because I looked older &#8211; taller, strong features etc. In my early 20s, it was because I worked in a professional environment, and was required to be mature and sophisticated.</p>\n<p>Now, raising children in my late twenties, I am surrounded by people who are generally older than me. Age, though, becomes irrelevant. 20, 30, 40. It&#8217;s all irrelevant. What counts is that we are mothers.</p>\n<p>There are lists out there &#8211; <a href=\"http://essentiallyjess.com/2013/02/4638.html\">Countdown to Awesome</a>, <a href=\"http://awesomelyawake.com/an-awake-challenge-write-a-life-list/\">40-by-40</a>&#8230;I don&#8217;t know &#8211; 30-by-30? I really can&#8217;t think of 30 things I still need to do, or have time to do before July.</p>\n<p>What I would like to do though is concentrate on my health. Health has always been important to me. We grew up, eating healthy foods, exercising in the sunshine. I have had bouts of drinking or smoking or doing otherwise unhealthy things, but nothing in excess. My personality is too moderate. I like to sleep well, feel energetic and feel happy.</p>\n<p>When I met Heart Daddy, I ate more cake than ever before, but in recent years, I have continued to be pretty healthy. (Please ignore ice-cream and\u00a0liqueur consumed 5 minutes ago.)</p>\n<p>Since having children, I have tried to exercise regularly, get enough sleep and eat well. Of course, breastfeeding and pregnancy have been good motivators for not drinking alcohol\u00a0(Again, please ignore ice-cream and\u00a0liqueur consumed 5 minutes ago.)</p>\n<p>Before my pregnancy with Heart Baby, I joined a running group, and was training hard (by my standards). Two solid training sessions a week. This even involved 6am starts. Not so fun, but I got fit quick. I recently saw photos of myself pre-pregnancy. I looked fit.</p>\n<p>I started running again about two weeks after baby&#8217;s birth. It seems early, but I needed to shed my inside skin and get out. I took it slowly.</p>\n<p>I try and keep it easy, so I actually do it. Just a couple of kms, and more, if the weather is cool, and the mood is right. I have been pushing the pram to the park, about 1.5km each way. Or the other day pushed it up the hill to buy milk. I feel that pramacise gets bonus points. Less kms needed.</p>\n<p>Running a couple of times a week keeps me sane. As a bonus, I have shed a few baby kilos, and feel a little less flabby.</p>\n<p>My green smoothie helps.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2308\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img_4089.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-2308\" alt=\"Green smoothie ingredients\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img_4089.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=682\"   /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Green smoothie ingredients</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_2309\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img_4092.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-2309\" alt=\"Yummy green colour\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img_4092.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=682\"   /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Yummy green colour</p></div>\n<p><strong>Green Smoothie</strong></p>\n<p>Kale<br />\nStrawberries<br />\nApple<br />\nBlueberries<br />\nLemon<br />\nGinger<br />\n1 tbs spirulina</p>\n<p>Although Heart Baby is waking up all hours, and I am still staying up to 11pm, with occasional runs and green smoothie action, I am feeling pretty great.</p>\n<p>Fit for thirty?

Blog and I &#8211; not sure what we are doing.</p>\n<p>Like with every relationship, I do what I do best: over-think. I lie in bed, staring at the ceiling, wondering what can be done. Will this last? I don&#8217;t know if, in the next bed, blog is doing the same. I can only hope.</p>\n<p>Reading other blogs has opened me up to another world. Daily, posts by thoughtful writers are flowing into my inbox. Blogging has made me privy to so many internal worlds. It&#8217;s a privilege.</p>\n<p>But as I read, I question what is going on here &#8211; on this blog. Do I write interesting material? Do I enjoy writing about my children? Do I like the\u00a0<em>look\u00a0</em>and\u00a0<em>feel\u00a0</em>of my blog?</p>\n<p>I think the hiccup, the last straw, the reason we are sleeping in separate beds,\u00a0is related to the fact that I am finding it harder to talk about my children.</p>\n<p>Part of me wants to share every little detail for the Granny Annie&#8217;s and Mati&#8217;s of this world, or for the children themselves, as they grow older. Another part of me wants to tuck them away, and keep them to myself.</p>\n<p>I feel like this blog has gone on a little journey. At its conception, it was a mum blog. I didn&#8217;t know, at the time, that mum blogging was a Thing. I thought, in my silly little mind, that blogging about one&#8217;s children was\u00a0<em>original.\u00a0</em>Ha-di-ha.</p>\n<p>I enjoyed sharing quirky anecdotes, and long lost friends would write to me to tell me how much they enjoyed reading them. I was encouraged. I continued.</p>\n<p>As I wrote, I made more friends, and received more positive feedback. At some point, I channelled my blog towards gentle, nurturing parenting, and put a slant on some posts which would resonate with some parents.</p>\n<p>But as I parent, and as I blog, I am not sure I want this to be the focus of my blog, any longer.</p>\n<p>I have happily,\u00a0<em>enthusiastically</em>, tapped out the heart stories that belong to my children. But, now, I hesitate. As they grow, and become of this world, I wonder more about the right I have to share their little stories. Can I write this blog without them?</p>\n<p>The answer is&#8230;</p>\n<p>I am not sure.</p>\n<p>What I do know, laying, looking at the ceiling, pondering the nature of my relationship with blog, is that I want it to continue. I\u00a0<em>need\u00a0</em>it to continue. Blogging has now become so addictive that I think in blog. (Bloggers will no doubt know what I mean.)</p>\n<p>But I want to take blog&#8217;s journey in a new direction. I want to write beyond the parenting experience. While I continue to advocate gentle parenting styles, and will no doubt be unable to avoid writing about my children, in some way, I want to write about other ideas too. Return to blogging for the sake of blogging.</p>\n<p>What is that again?</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"http://maxabellaloves.blogspot.com.au/search?updated-max=2013-03-07T14:00:00%2B11:00&amp;max-results=5\">Maxabella</a> wrote recently:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8230;you&#8217;ll know exactly what I mean when I say that the heart of blogging is something we&#8217;ve all got to hang onto tightly if we don&#8217;t want to lose the essence of what blogging is really all about.

Add to olive oil, stir around pot to coat mix evenly with olive oil. I usually add more olive oil to coat ingredients and add the sea salt to taste. \u00a0On a very low heat let the mix slowly cook. Stir regularly to allow even heating of the ingredients. \u00a0Once the mix starts to smell really good (looks and smells like it is becoming caramelised) I chop the beetroot tops (or greens) and stir into the beetroot mix until they wilt. \u00a0At this point I add enough boiled water to cover the beetroot and let the mix simmer. \u00a0Usually I am doing other things in the kitchen so I just let it go for an hour or so. Then I slice the potatoes and add to the soup, making sure vegetables are covered with water and let it simmer for another hour or so. \u00a0Then I use a stick blender to blend into a yummy red soup.</p>\n<p>Serve with a dollop of greek yoghurt (or thick cream), sprinkle with chopped chives, and slice the toast into 2 cm strips and place around the bowl so you can dunk and eat the soup off the toast.

I want to undo the last 24&#8230;48&#8230;76 hours please (I have forgotten how to add).</p>\n<p>I want to go back to a time &#8211; an age of innocence, before I walked out that preschool gate, carrying a baby, and leaving a screaming child. I want to go back and do it all again. Differently. Please please.</p>\n<p>I can&#8217;t, can I?</p>\n<p>They told me this is the right thing to do. Clean break. Don&#8217;t hang around. Don&#8217;t hesitate. Just go. I dithered, torn between a strong belief in what is right for my child, and a sense of courtesy.</p>\n<p>Would you believe courtesy won out?</p>\n<p>I put being\u00a0<em>polite</em> over the wellbeing of my child.</p>\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t until 3 o&#8217;clock the next morning that my head cleared, and I worked out that what happened was\u00a0<em>not</em>\u00a0right. I was spineless, and I want to go back and do it all again.</p>\n<p>This is how it went&#8230;</p>\n<p>My daughter loved every minute of preschool. She came home singing and dancing. I marvelled at her ease. How does she do it? We waited until the time was right, and evidently it was.</p>\n<p>Then, to bond with the preschool community, I dragged two overtired children to the evening BBQ/disco. My daughter hovered at the periphery, for the first time, uncertain. She was only 3. Some of these kids were 5. They ran around, playing together. She sucked her little finger.</p>\n<p>We didn&#8217;t talk about it, until the morning of her preschool day.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to go to preschool&#8221;, she said. I was surprised. When I dug deeper, she said she was worried about all the big kids running around. That&#8217;s OK. She&#8217;s also worried about chickens half a mile off. I understand.</p>\n<p>We made the mistake of saying she could go and see what it was like, and if she didn&#8217;t like it, she could come home. The mistake was the latter part of that statement. She called our bluff, and we brought her home.</p>\n<p>I was sad she was missing out on all the fun.</p>\n<p>The preschool teachers were quick to clarify our wrong-doings. Clean break, separation, etc. If we&#8217;d stayed another hour, her response would have been the same. We just needed to leave her, and trust it would all be OK.</p>\n<p>The following week, the sequence played out in the same way. I don&#8217;t want to go, let&#8217;s just go see, get there, I want to go home.</p>\n<p>I stayed with her while she played with a friend. At some point, I needed to check if baby was awake, and explained to her I would be back in a moment. She was cool with that.</p>\n<p>In my two minute absence, though, she freaked out, and ran around screaming, looking for me. I was there, with baby, reassuring her that I wouldn&#8217;t go without saying good bye, but by that time, two carers had us cornered. I had to make a clean break, they were saying. This is separation, they were saying. If I stay longer, the same thing will happen an hour later, they were saying.</p>\n<p>They had me walking out the gate.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Hang on,&#8221; I said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to go yet. I just want to wait until she is calm again.&#8221; Knowing my daughter, I knew that she just needed a moment, and would give me permission to go when she was ready. If not, I would just take her home, as before.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You need to go, we will call you. She will be OK, and if she&#8217;s not, we will let you know.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Scared of confrontation, doubting my confidence, too polite for my own good &#8211; I don&#8217;t know what exactly my motivation was, but there I was on one side of the gate and she, screaming hysterically, was on the other. I could hear the screams up the road, where I parked to call my husband.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What the hell have I just done?&#8221;</p>\n<p>I called the carers. &#8220;She&#8217;s OK,&#8221; they said. &#8220;Just sobbing quietly. Oh, now she is singing with the others. She&#8217;s fine.&#8221;</p>\n<p>After the trauma had already happened, what could I do? I left.</p>\n<p>Yesterday, I saw a lot of anger and sadness in her. Don&#8217;t worry, I am not imagining things. I am hyper vigilant about not being one of those overly neurotic mothers. But it was there. Anger. Sadness. And I don&#8217;t blame her. I would feel pretty pissed off too, if it was me, left on the other side of the gate.</p>\n<p>I have studied psychology. I understand the terminology. Separation anxiety etc. But I don&#8217;t think it needs to be that way. Unlike many mothers, I didn&#8217;t have to go to work. I work from home, and my work is flexible. I would have stayed another hour, happily.</p>\n<p>Whatever the status quo, I am upset I let myself be led down a path I never wanted to go. And I definitely didn&#8217;t want that for my child.</p>\n<p>I can&#8217;t rewind. But I guess I can help heal that wound. And I can try and make amends. We can do it better, next time. And if we can&#8217;t, we&#8217;ll try preschool again when we are ready.</p>\n<p>And I can learn from this. I can learn to get a spine, and practice what I preach, and put two feet firmly on the ground.</p>\n<p>Whatever you are to me blog, I am glad you are there. This experience has haunted me all week, and now it is out. Blurgh. Sorry world, you can have it. I don&#8217;t want it caught in my chest.

He&#8217;s said to be the &#8220;the biggest new talent to emerge thus far in the 00&#8217;s&#8221; by the New York Times Book Review.</p>\n<p>His books are GREAT.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s refreshing to read to a kid something that is more than a story.</p>\n<p>The Knuffle Bunny books are a series about growing up. Most people identify with having a loved stuff toy or blanky. Knuffle Bunny is Trixie&#8217;s, and through these adventures, Trixie morphs from pre-verbal toddler to Big Girl.</p>\n<p>(<em>Knuffle</em> means cuddle in Dutch. The Dutch connection was a bonus for us.)</p>\n<p>As the mother of a fast-becoming-big-girl, the emotions Mo captures in very simple language are very real. Little Trixie sitting alone, in the bath, without her Knuffle Bunny, not quite wanting to be big, is so poignant. I know that girl.</p>\n<p>The terrible monster, Leonardo is adorable. Again, big emotions, few words. Funny, cute pictures. Perfect children&#8217;s book stuff.</p>\n<p>And the pigeon&#8230;it&#8217;s hard to describe. Big emotions, even fewer words. I guess the pigeon books role-play typical kid conflicts, like getting their heads around the word &#8216;no&#8217;, or being told they should be happy. Kids get pigeon.</p>\n<p>Little Heart wants them read over and over. Really &#8211; over and over and over. Fortunately, you don&#8217;t get sick of them.</p>\n<p>If you haven&#8217;t heard of Mo Willems, you love Sesame Street, and something a bit different, I can recommend these.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong><em>Please join me at the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/heartmamaxx\">Heart Mama Community\u00a0on Facebook</a>, and subscribe to receive posts by email if you enjoy reading.</em></strong></p>\n", "post_id": 2378, "location": false, "date": "03-23-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["parenting", "stress", "business", "slowing down"], "text": "<div id=\"attachment_2385\" style=\"width: 622px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/sisters1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2385\" alt=\"New walls, and the reason for existence\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/sisters1.jpg?w=612&#038;h=612\" width=\"612\" height=\"612\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">New walls, and the reason for existence</p></div>\n<p>Why do we do it to ourselves?</p>\n<p>Life becomes eclipsed by&#8230;life. Business. Hurriedness. Work. Oh my god, so so much work to do. Please don&#8217;t remind me.</p>\n<p>A couple of months ago, rainstorms inundated our area. There were floods, cyclones, and the most torrential rain you have ever known.</p>\n<p>During this period, when we opened our front door, we were bombarded with the stench of musty, old, mouldy carpet. Yuk.</p>\n<p>This house was built in 1987, and the daggy old beige carpet saw 23 years of dog hair and three years of toddler mess. Not to mention the build up of other unsightlies and insects and dust, and whatever else is shed by the house&#8217;s inhabitants.</p>\n<p>After the torrential rains of February, we decided we couldn&#8217;t do another winter like this.</p>\n<p>My husband began to pull up the beige and dusty carpet. Room by room. Hell, while we are at it, we may as well fill and paint the walls. And skirts. And doors. Better tile too. The job became epic.</p>\n<p>Furniture was moved from tiny bedroom into tiny living room. The king size bed was propped behind the couch. My clothes hung from the curtain rods in the living room. There was not a spare inch of space for a toddler to mess up.</p>\n<p>The advantage was, mess could go unnoticed. The whole place was Mess, so I turned a blind eye to little messes that accumulated around the craft table, or the toy area. A few less things to do in a day. Bonus.</p>\n<p>We moved out to my parent&#8217;s &#8216;shed&#8217;, while Heart Daddy slaved away each day, and each night, painting and tiling between massages and other work.</p>\n<p>I worked too, when I could. Between minding two little girls and husband working. It was madness.</p>\n<p>I am not often on my own with the two littlies. When I am, it&#8217;s lovely, but after a full day, I am spent. I have done enough giving, and I just want to pass out. Evenings were the hardest, trying to entertain my older daughter while putting baby to sleep. We barely had a night without some form of melt down.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, I got an ear infection. Rarely sick, this completely knocked me behind the knees. I was a basket case.</p>\n<p>And because I was cranky von snitchy pants with an earache, and my husband was unavailable for almost three weeks,\u00a0and<em>\u00a0</em>we were living in someone else&#8217;s house, my older daughter apart. We had so many struggles over the last few weeks.</p>\n<p>Repeatedly, though, she kept telling me she wanted to go home. &#8220;Has Daddy done the tiling yet?&#8221; she kept asking.</p>\n<p>We underestimated how much this would affect her. Consequently, she resigned from preschool.</p>\n<p>We moved back on Sunday. The charcoal tiles and newly painted white walls look incredible. Our small dingy musty house now feels open, light and fresh. I love it. But our furniture and books are still stacked to the ceiling, as there is more to be done. Clothes are still in piles. The grass has not been mown for weeks; it&#8217;s knee-length.</p>\n<p>Why do we do it to ourselves? Why so busy? So stretched? When all we want to do is lay on the floor beside children, singing stupid songs?</p>\n<p>My aunty told us this is the time to pedal hard, and pedal fast. Maybe she&#8217;s right. But maybe we have had enough of peddling hard and peddling fast, and need to turn the dial to slow while we recuperate, and breathe in, in preparation for the next leg.</p>\n<p>I can&#8217;t ignore my mountain of work. Or the six-foot grass. These things all need attention. But so do my girls. It&#8217;s time to slow down.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong><em>Please join me at the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/heartmamaxx\">Heart Mama Community\u00a0on Facebook</a>, and subscribe to receive posts by email if you enjoy reading.</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Linking with Grace at <a href=\"http://www.withsomegrace.com/\">With Some Grace</a> for Friday.</p>\n", "post_id": 2384, "location": false, "date": "03-26-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["rabbits", "Easter Monday", "children's book", "Margery Williams", "Easter", "The Velveteen Rabbit"], "text": "<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-2399\" alt=\"the-velveteen-rabbit\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/the-velveteen-rabbit.jpeg?w=375&#038;h=491\" width=\"375\" height=\"491\" /></p>\n<p>In the chaos this is our house, my daughter found a copy of <em>The Velveteen Rabbit</em> this evening.

I can&#8217;t remember.</p>\n<p>Margery Williams tells the story of a rabbit who wants to be Real. It&#8217;s a tale about becoming mortal, rather than immortal.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;What is REAL?&#8221; asked the Rabbit one day, when they were lying side by side near the nursery fender, before Nana came to tidy the room. &#8220;Does it mean having things that buzz inside you and a stick-out handle?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Real isn&#8217;t how you are made,&#8221; said the Skin Horse. &#8220;It&#8217;s a thing that happens to you.

But for me, it&#8217;s OK. Cutlery gets dumped in. Cutlery gets taken out, when needed. There is no system. No order. It doesn&#8217;t look terribly good. But it&#8217;s functional. And it saves time &#8211; microseconds of time &#8211; but all those microseconds add up. And if there is one thing I am thrifty about, it&#8217;s time.</p>\n<p>I save up every microsecond and put it where it counts.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s how I get it all done. Two girls, living in chaos, writing 100 &#8211; 150 page books each month, blogging, socialising&#8230;all those scrupulously saved microseconds go where they ought to go.</p>\n<p>I think, the secret to living with furniture piled up to the ceiling, dump-and-run cutlery drawers, and knee-high grass, is a quiet mind.</p>\n<p>Occasionally it pangs. Like the day we returned home and the furniture, the grass and the still-to-be-written 150 page book began to seep into the crevices of my mind, munch at its happy, calm corners until happy and calm were out, and chaos and overwhelmed-ness were in.</p>\n<p><strong>The Mountain</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong>The other night, a group of women sat beside the lake, with candles and thermoses of tea. The moon was nearly full, its reflection on the water&#8217;s silky surface. It was very Witches of Eastwick. One of the ladies read aloud a card about the Mountain Mother. Standing still, in the present moment, her head in the clouds, but grounded. Life and children happen, but she is still and resilient.</p>\n<p>I used the mountain metaphor in my less happy, calm years. I visualised being a mountain, as seasons passed, clouds passed, the sky changed colour and the wind blew. Reflecting on it all. Being present. Grounded.</p>\n<p>It helped me get out of my head.</p>\n<p>My head was no longer like my cutlery drawer.</p>\n<p><strong>My cutlery drawer</strong></p>\n<p>While I am mountain, and my head is clear, I can have a drawer, like my cutlery drawer. I can have a million books to write, and a 3-year-old like a crazed tornado high on sugar (that&#8217;s no metaphor), and a baby, and a house where you negotiate stacked chairs and boxes to get to the kitchen.</p>\n<p>If I let the chaos creep in though, I become a little like that crazed 3-year-old, and it all comes crashing down.

Then there&#8217;s impossible.</p>\n<p>Like that half hour you are desperately trying to get out the door. &#8220;I need my flower shoes!&#8221; &#8220;They are too big for you, and I don&#8217;t know where they are.&#8221; &#8220;But I\u00a0<em>neeeed [insert high-pitched scream here]\u00a0</em>them!&#8221; &#8220;No!&#8221; &#8220;Yes!&#8221; &#8220;No!&#8221; (Unreasonable.)</p>\n<p>And in that same half hour&#8230;</p>\n<p>&#8220;But I need that painting.

I am not getting it.&#8221; &#8220;But I\u00a0<em>neeeed [insert high-pitched scream here]\u00a0</em>it!&#8221;\u00a0&#8220;No!&#8221; &#8220;Yes!&#8221; &#8220;No!&#8221; (Unreasonable.)</p>\n<p>Later that day&#8230;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Put the box under the hammock. No, not like that. Like that. Like THAT! Under the bottom. No, the feet. Under the feet. Like a hot air balloon! Tie the hammer to the ribbon. No, not like that. Like THAT! <em>[insert high-pitched scream here]\u00a0</em>Not there, THERE! <em>[insert high-pitched scream here]</em>&#8220;</p>\n<p>Even later that day&#8230;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I need the mouse one. No that&#8217;s not the mouse one! Not that one, the other one! The other ONE! <em>[insert high-pitched scream here]</em>&#8220;</p>\n<p>The unreasonable requests, on their own, are OK. After all, from a three-year-old&#8217;s perspective, they are not unreasonable at all.\u00a0Impossible requests &#8211; they are getting tricky.</p>\n<p>But it is when any request of any impossible nature is accompanied by a high-pitched screech, perfectly pitched to get you leaping into full-blown action, or rolling on the floor in tears that mummy falls into a frustrated, messy, cranky puddle.</p>\n<p>The screech. Like nails on a blackboard. Without it, I can handle anything. Before the screeching and the age of impossible, I believed I could solve every problem. Now, my resolve has been weakened, and I am pretty sure my solution will be rejected.</p>\n<p>People assume I am perennially gentle. Believe me, I wish I was. But when the impossible requests and the screeching happens in pairs throughout the day, I begin to get my &#8220;Mum&#8221; voice on, and sound less than gentle.</p>\n<p>I hate how I sound.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Right, I have had enough. No more!&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I will not get that painting. It&#8217;s ridiculous. Now get in the car.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Actually, I can&#8217;t even bear to write it all down. It&#8217;s like hearing my voice on a tape recording. Yuk.</p>\n<p>Every morning, I wake with a new resolution.\u00a0<em>Today</em> I won&#8217;t get frustrated.</p>\n<p>But I know from reading other people&#8217;s blogs and status updates, this is a global phenomenon. Mums get their cranky on when they have had enough of cranky children. I swore this wouldn&#8217;t be me. But then these words are coming out of my mouth, coded into me. No matter how many resolutions I make, they come, with the crazy three-year-old requests.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a shame they grow up,&#8221; said a shopkeeper, admiring the quiet baby I held in my arms. I nodded, in agreement, because at that point my three-year-old was yelling at me to do something or other. I didn&#8217;t want to be that mother who thought this thought.

I am trying to control the situation by putting my foot down, and not putting up with it anymore, no! I have had enough. It&#8217;s time to stop.</p>\n<p>But I can&#8217;t control her. And of course, the\u00a0<em>bigger picture</em> me knows I don&#8217;t want to control her. I really don&#8217;t. I want her to be free-spirited. Unrestrained. This is what makes the children I know so beautiful.</p>\n<p>Raising free-spirited children, who are now not only free, but have their own minds, and can disagree, and insist and refuse and invent impossible scenarios, which must happen immediately is all very very challenging.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m hanging in there, not quite. Trying to get my head around Three &#8211; The Age of Impossible.</p>\n<p><em>*Note. Since writing this last night, things completely turned on their head.

This post brought my thoughts to the surface.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s hard not to think about grass, or mowing, when you look at grass like ours. It&#8217;s like the old man with nostril hairs you can&#8217;t not look at when he talks; our grass has been coming out of all orifices.</p>\n<p>Our veggie patch has been more grass than veggie.</p>\n<p>Grass has swept into every so-called garden bed, and grown taller than any plant.</p>\n<p>With wild wet weather, there has been little opportunity to mow.</p>\n<p>But that can&#8217;t just be it, can it? Almost every other house in our village keeps their grass like a number one crew cut. How do they get it so damn neat?</p>\n<p>Walking round our estate, it&#8217;s hard to imagine who keeps such lawns. Houses are shut up. People are at work. Children at school. No longer just an older person&#8217;s community, these houses are homes to families. But families are not home.</p>\n<p>Who mows the grass?</p>\n<p>We aren&#8217;t the only house in the village with un-neat lawn. There are a few houses, and they all happen to be houses of people I know. Surprisingly (or not), people with young children.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.tinysavages.com/2013/04/10/i-like-to-mow/\">Carli</a> writes that her love of mowing comes from a place of privilege &#8211; of owning a good lawnmower and having a small lawn. There is privilege, too, in having time.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s hard to articulate to others where the time goes once young children are on the scene. I know it looks easy &#8211; is easy, and enjoyable, and sunshine (mostly) &#8211; but it&#8217;s so time consuming. Seriously, at some point it becomes a privilege to pee.</p>\n<p>And when you weave in renovations and full-time work, having time to mow the lawn between thunderstorms is like squeezing water from a carrot. It ain&#8217;t happening.</p>\n<p>Today my lawn was backyard blitzed. My aunt and uncle, in town for but a weekend, with my parents blitzed every square inch of my tufty old lawn. The veggie patch &#8211; more a patch of tall grass, was blitzed. The herb garden was born again. My neighbours audibly breathed a sigh of relief. So did everyone who ever had to look at our lawn.</p>\n<p>There is much to be said about a bunch of lovely people coming in on their own accord and conducting a blitz. They could see we have been\u00a0inundated\u00a0to the eyeballs, and had the heart to lend a brushcutting arm.</p>\n<p>I would genuinely like to mow more &#8211; scratch that, like my\u00a0<em>husband</em> to mow more. \u00a0But I would also like him to spend our only hour together a day sitting down, having dinner with us, before the bedtime rush begins.</p>\n<p>One day we will be retired and our children will be grown-up, and we will keep on top of the north coast weedfest. We may even be able to weed and mow for our daughters. Until then, thank you to my blitzers, and sorry to those who have to endure our long grass.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://essentiallyjess.com/\">Linking with Essentially Jess, because I wrote this blog on a Tuesday.</a></p>\n", "post_id": 2445, "location": false, "date": "04-15-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["north coast of NSW"], "text": "<div id=\"attachment_2452\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/rawcake.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-2452\" alt=\"Raw cake.

They lay on the sand, on their tummies. Strangers, absorbed in the moment, watching a crab scuttle over their fingers, and into the sand. Two other children joined them, and the four of them scrambled up the rocky mound, looking for more crabs.</p>\n<p>The other children left and we bought a fresh coconut from the coconut cart.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/beach2.jpeg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-2457\" alt=\"beach2\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/beach2.jpeg?w=1024&#038;h=1024\"   /></a>Another little girl was playing on the sand. She and my little girl chatted. They too lay on the sand together, on their tummies, as if they had been laying side by side, chatting about girl things, for years.</p>\n<p>My daughter isn&#8217;t always &#8216;brave&#8217;. It&#8217;s a thing for her. &#8220;I was brave of those dogs,&#8221; she tells me proudly, as we walk past two pooches on leads. Mostly, at the play park, she hovers at the periphery, watching. If we are there long enough, she&#8217;ll pick up her courage and take it into the centre of the action. Sometimes, she&#8217;ll make a friend. It&#8217;s heartbreaking, separating her and her new little friends after such a build-up, to take her home.</p>\n<p>Watching her with these children she&#8217;d never met, lost in a beach experience that belonged only to that afternoon, I wondered at which point you lose the innocence to lay along side a stranger in the sun. Surely, I too once made a little friend on a sunny day at the beach.</p>\n<p>But as I grew taller, and more aware of my world; more aware of social conventions and what other people would think of me; I began to hold the periphery tight. Although seemingly a social person, who easily makes friends, the thought of talking to somebody I didn&#8217;t know was paralysing.\u00a0<em>What if they don&#8217;t like me? What will they think of me?</em>\u00a0When all that mattered were these things&#8230;<em>do they like me?</em> meeting people was complex, and painful.</p>\n<p>People talk about &#8216;childish innocence&#8217;, and the ability to &#8216;be in the moment, like a child&#8217;. There is wistfulness and longing attached to the idea of childhood. Today, sitting on the rocks, watching my daughter, I got it.\u00a0Childhood is precious. Sharing an activity with another person you have never met before and will likely never meet again, whose name you don&#8217;t know, is an experience that belongs only to childhood.

Aspiring children&#8217;s book writers are told that children like \u00a0magic and monsters. It&#8217;s true. Among the books sent to us by Scholastic, which are published this year, this was the book that stood out for my little girl.</p>\n<p>Monsters are an archetype which represent bad/evil. The monster lurks under many a child&#8217;s bed. It embodies\u00a0their general fears. The concept of fear begins to emerge for preschool age children, as their fantasy world expands, and awareness of concepts like darkness, death, or pain develop.</p>\n<p>Maybe, monsters under beds is a common theme because children fear being alone, as they lay in the dark, trying to sleep. Their fantasy hooks into an image they have seen, and the fictitious monster begins to seem real.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Why does the monster have teeth?&#8221; my daughter asks, among a million other Why questions. I don&#8217;t know. Why do monsters have teeth? What I know is that monsters capture children&#8217;s imagination.</p>\n<p>We read the book, and read the book again. And once more for good measure. We then set a monster trap, like Lukas does in the story. The box the books came in was perfect. We propped it up with a piece of wood, and instead of cookies, we put macadamia nuts out to tempt the monster.</p>\n<p>In this book, Lukas takes control of his situation, and his fear. And when he does meet the monster, it&#8217;s is not as bad as he imagined. In fact, it&#8217;s rather friendly.</p>\n<p>The illustrations in this book are beautiful. You can see more of Christina Bollenbach&#8217;s work <a href=\"http://www.christinabollenbach.net/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><em>How to Catch a Monster</em> is a really sweet book, and as far as I know, is no relationship to the Ryan Gosling movie\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2366608/\"><em>How To Catch a Monster</em></a>, featuring Christina\u00a0<em>Hendricks </em>(not Bollenbach) due for release next year.</p>\n<p><em>Do monsters live under the beds of your children?

I&#8217;ve been working more, and spare time is spent driving to markets or hanging out with friends. Usually, we read books together at night &#8211; our special time, nestled in together on the marshmallow couch. But lately Baby has been waking up for a feed at exactly that time.</p>\n<p>You would think I would cherish every moment of down time with my older daughter, desperate for a piece of her. But the truth is, when we have down time, I get frustrated more than normal by her three-year-old demands and ways. The whingeing grates more than normal, and the screeches are intolerable. I am short, sharp and heavy with her, my patience like a short wick.</p>\n<p>So quickly, we snowball into a mess. Like this afternoon, sleep-deprived Baby hangs <em>asleep\u00a0</em>in a sling on my front, while I cut out shapes with older daughter. I am trying to be crafty, but I am failing miserably. Why do I bother?</p>\n<p>&#8220;They are diamonds.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want diamonds. I want diamonds\u00a0<em>after.</em><em>&#8220;</em></p>\n<p>&#8220;Do you want hearts?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I want diamonds AFTER!&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Do you want circles?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I want diamonds AFTER!&#8221;</p>\n<p>And so forth.</p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t understand what she meant. Instead, she screeched and baby woke up after twenty minutes. I yelled. I told her I was so mad at her, and she said: &#8220;You can&#8217;t be mad at me. I am crying. You can&#8217;t be mad at me for being sad.&#8221;</p>\n<p>How true that is. How my little heart broke. Damn me for being so wretched.</p>\n<p>After the adrenaline of screaming, I felt down. I was about to come crashing down on my self, criticise me, blame me etc. but then my daughter was so incredibly forgiving, I didn&#8217;t have the opportunity.</p>\n<p>We ate spaghetti\u00a0Bolognese, sitting on the grass in the backyard.</p>\n<p>We showered together with baby.</p>\n<p>We read together.

Although he was supportive, and did as much as possible to make life easy for me (i.e. housework, always washing the dishes, and the laundry) I still somehow thought I&#8217;d been dealt a bad hand in the caring husband and father department. I guess lack of sleep and the new found responsibility over a LIFE is a little stressful. Then there&#8217;s the Dad&#8217;s stress about managing the affairs, bringing in the bread and butter, etc. That&#8217;s stressful too. And he too is trying to get enough sleep to function effectively in his working life.</p>\n<p>And of course there is the key factor &#8211; the change in your sex life. Everyone&#8217;s different &#8211; some couples jump back into bed together immediately following the birth. Others don&#8217;t have sex all year. From my point of view, I definitely didn&#8217;t feel like it that often &#8211; I was tired and &#8230;I like this term&#8230;&#8221;Touched Out&#8221;. When breastfeeding, the mother and baby excrete oxytocin, the lurve hormone. So biologically, we are probably being told &#8211; don&#8217;t reproduce! One is enough for now! The lads, though, don&#8217;t get this hormone (I don&#8217;t think). And sex for many is still a definite interest. I guess it&#8217;s where the ability to compromise comes in handy &#8211; he asks a bit less, she gives a bit more, or something like that&#8230;And eventually, hopefully, you both get what you want once more! Sex, though, isn&#8217;t the only way to share love for one another. We found giving each other lots of hugs was a very positive thing to gel us, and remind us of togetherness.</p>\n<p>Everything changes with a bub, and relationships aren&#8217;t exempt. Fortunately, my partner and I bounced back pretty quickly. Greg reflects back that we didn&#8217;t fight much at all, but I still cringe when I think about myself bossing him around, criticising him for holding the baby the wrong way, or expecting him to do everything that I could no longer do around the house. I guess what held us together were a few vital ingredients:</p>\n<p>* Tireless communication<br />\n* Lots of cuddles<br />\n* Humour</p>\n<p>And yes the birth educator was right, complimenting each other where possible, and thanking each other go along way in restoring relationship harmony.</p>\n<p>Now that baby life is easy, I look back with pride at our resilience to be so strong together and supportive. But I also know how easy it is to let such a momentous change take control, and let yourselves slip into negative habits, and a relationship that will never again reach it&#8217;s pre-baby bliss.</p>\n<p>All I am saying, is that I reckon we all are subject to some relationship drama when a new baby arrives &#8211; so no-one is alone there!</p>\n", "post_id": 25, "location": false, "date": "06-04-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Jude Blereau", "baby food", "healthy family", "eating habits"], "text": "<p>The first time round, we did it all wrong.</p>\n<p>We have created a toddler that sits on our backs during dinner.

Like chocolate, the therapeutic effect wears thin the moment you open up your shopping bags and feel miserably disappointed with what you bought.</p>\n<p>Once up a time, I had an income, and occasionally took to the shops. Admittedly, apart from when I was 11, I have never been a big shopper&#8230;The malls make me dizzy, and I couldn&#8217;t ever stomach paying $6o for a singlet top, no matter what I was earning. So my retail therapy was\u00a0conducted at the markets or in an op-shop.</p>\n<p>Now that I have no income, and we live on a shoe-string, I still can&#8217;t help but to pop into Vinnie&#8217;s on a bad day. Inevitably, I always emerge with two or three bags of goodies, having spent about $20. Much of that stuff goes back to Vinnie&#8217;s at some point, but for its&#8217; life with us, we manage to find some enjoyment. More than I would from a $60 singlet.</p>\n<p>Here, for example, is a favourite op-shop purchase, selected lovingly by Elka. In fact, we cannot go into an op-shop these days without yet another &#8220;Dolly&#8221; making it into the mix. Isn&#8217;t she beautiful?

No&#8230;far from it! In fact, there are at least a million other mum bloggers, merrily typing, sharing their lives, from the comical to the sincere to the plain ridiculous. If you type into Google &#8220;50 Top Mom Bloggers&#8221; (American Style) you get over 50 page suggestions. And that&#8217;s just America. And within each of those are 50 mom blogs, and they are just the best of this last year&#8230;dear oh dear. Here I was thinking blogging so originally about my thoughts and my life would make me famous. Only now I am beginning to realise.</p>\n<p>Just one more to add to the list of &#8220;Zannisms&#8221; ~ Zannism (<em>n</em>): the way in which\u00a0Zanni has a slightly creative and wacky way of looking at the world (Greg, 2009).</p>\n<p>Previous Zannisms include:</p>\n<p>&#8221; How do trams get around? On little sticks that poke into the rails, which are somehow directed by electricity&#8230;what, they have wheels? That&#8217;s so weird! I would never have imagined that!&#8221; (Zannism, 2009)</p>\n<p>&#8220;No Greg&#8230;that is not how gravity works. We stick to the earth because it spins. The\u00a0spinning motion means we stick to the earth.&#8221; &#8220;No, Zanni. Gravity is a universal force between objects that have a mass. It has nothing to do with the earth spinning.

Fine time for me to think exactly what my blog is about, and what makes it (somewhat) unique. Well, obviously, my blog is about my charmed life with Elka and Greg, and about our daily activities, and philosophical pondering, and about how Elka sings <em><a title=\"Row row row\" href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.com/2011/06/18/row-row-row/\" target=\"_blank\">Hallelujah</a></em>\u00a0to her dollies to put them to sleep (ahhh&#8230;). My blog is first written for myself, because I love writing regularly, and the thing I know best is my family, and my personal experience. Dah. And secondly, I write\u00a0for Elka, for when she grows up into a big Elka, she will have a story of her childhood (providing WordPress doesn&#8217;t fold). And thirdly, I write it for everyone who wants to read it, and I\u00a0am touched by the number of hits and responses I get for my blog to date.</p>\n<p>What characterises this blog is that it is honest&#8230;from the funny, to the inane, to the tragic, to the practical. It is sincere without being sentimental, and humourous without being harsh or critical (I hope).</p>\n<p>I welcome any feedback people have&#8230;anything you would like to read more about, like which stories you enjoying reading in particular. Always feel free to comment on a post. I love your thoughts, your reflection, and your opinion. (And &#8220;like my Facebook page ~ it&#8217;s such a great page to like!) Like everything I do, I am stumbling around na\u00efvely in the dark, finding my way in the big wide would, determining how gravity works, how to wash pans, how to blog, and how to be a mother. Help me if you can.</p>\n<p>Zannixx</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/elkaandme.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-262\" title=\"Elka and Me\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/elkaandme.jpg?w=250&#038;h=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 259, "location": false, "date": "07-24-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["photos", "craft", "children", "family", "granny"], "text": "<p>Elki and I share a love of beautifully illustrated children&#8217;s books.

I remember the &#8220;birds and the bees&#8221; conversation was an awkward dialogue between my Dad and I whilst digging holes on the farm one sunny afternoon. Stop. Please! Dad. That is SO gross! When I changed schools in year 11, and realised that girls my age had sex (shock horror), it took me many months to come to terms with this fact. People sun bathed naked and skinny-dipped at parties. I couldn&#8217;t believe it. On one drunken occasion, I joined in, and thus earnt\u00a0myself the &#8220;Most Likely To Become a Stripper&#8221; award at the year 12 formal. At the time, I couldn&#8217;t imagine a less likely candidate for such an award. Me, awkward and shy about everything that related to sex. Impossible.</p>\n<p>I am not yet a stripper, but things have come along way since year 12. For last night, the first night I spent away from my baby girl since she was born 19 months ago, I went to Orgasm School.</p>\n<p>Orgasm School is not what you&#8217;re \u00a0thinking it is. We didn&#8217;t lie around, screeching with pleasure. There were no dildos, or props of any kind. No, it was more a getting in touch with one&#8217;s inner orgasm. Also known as chi. Also known as energy. It was relaxation class, really, with a bit of pelvic jiggling, and bottom wiggling. Then we ended with a nice, gentle massage (of the back). I didn&#8217;t have an orgasm. I&#8217;m not sure if you were meant to or not &#8211; by the sounds coming from the other participants, anyone would think there were a series of full-flung orgasms in action. Importantly, by the end I felt relaxed and more in touch with my inner orgasm than before.</p>\n<p>Apparently, the world would be a better place if more women orgasmed.</p>\n<p>Apparently, women need to be stronger, softer, kinder, more accountable for themselves, and above all, more orgasmic.</p>\n<p>And finally, women, remember, your orgasm is a landscape&#8230;of clouds floating by, sunny some days and rainy the next, wind blowing and trees swaying.

Maternal instinct. Actually, it began months ago. My baby is still a baby, wearing nappies, and yet she can&#8217;t help herself. She takes her dolly into the garden and lovingly feeds her grass and flowers. She then brings her inside, puts her in her high chair, and takes her bits of fruit. She checks her nappy for poo, and finds a wipe to wipe her bottom. All with great care. She puts dolly in the pram to take her for a walk, and occasionally puts her to her breast for a drink (!) Recently, I have discovered that Elka cradles her doll in her arms, rocks her and sings<em> Hallelujah.</em>\u00a0I have not role-played any of these things with her and her doll. She has never seen other children play with dolls in this manner. And yet she models everything I do with her.</p>\n<p>The last few days, we have spent with a friend&#8217;s daughter who is a few months younger than Elka. With children her own age, Elka is prone to a bit of a tussle when it comes to sharing, or flapping her arms viciously if the other child of similar age and stature comes into her personal space. With this younger, and much small child, however, Elka has taken the maternal role. We went for a walk this afternoon, the younger child in the pram, and Elka walked along responsibly beside us. At some point, Elka wanted to take the little girl out of her pram and carry her. I helped her of course and Elka realised that carrying her herself was not an option. So she instead leaned in for a big cuddle, before taking her hand to walk her down the road.</p>\n<p>Once back at the house, Elka gave the little girl her water bottle, checked her for poos, then tried to lift her on to\u00a0the potty!</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_286\" style=\"width: 210px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.com/2011/08/01/maternal-instinct/penguin/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-286\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-286 \" title=\"Penguin\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/penguin.jpg?w=200&#038;h=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Paw Nation</p></div>\n<p>So it appears that oestrogen kicks in early. As do gender roles. It&#8217;s amazing what children are picking up and mimicking. We have never deliberately dressed Elka in pink or done her hair in frilly bows. I have never put her doll in the pram or any of the other maternal tasks she demonstrates. We don&#8217;t have a television, so Elka&#8217;s idea of gender roles is not coming from the media. How then does she know?</p>\n<p>I study psychology and there is an endless debate about nature versus nurture. The latest is that the two are very intertwined. In this respect, however, I am sure that nurture is taking a back seat, as Elka&#8217;s oestrogen kicks in, and she pretends to be a mum.

For this last week, I have diverged from my life as a mother into my <em>other </em>life&#8230;I have not only studied this week, but I have also attended a Life Line interview to become a telephone counsellor, a fiction workshop with <a title=\"MJ Hyland\" href=\"http://www.mjhyland.com/\" target=\"_blank\">MJ Hyland</a>, \u00a0I spent today at the <a title=\"Byron Bay Writer's Festival\" href=\"http://www.byronbaywritersfestival.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Byron Bay Writer&#8217;s Festival</a>\u00a0and my husband and I <em>went out to a movie&#8230;on our own </em>to see the final Harry Potter instalment<em>.\u00a0</em>All with the help of our wonderful Granny Annie.</p>\n<p>For those of you who also love to write, I want to share some of my experiences from the fiction workshop and from the festival. I am fortunate to live near Byron Bay and have access to this great event once a year.</p>\n<p>Doing the workshop with MJ Hyland made me realise that I have never really been given any writing tuition. I don&#8217;t know what syntax is, or exactly what passive voice means. Apart from one class in Year 5, I have never formally been taught grammar. I have learnt to structure an essay simply through osmosis, and have applied the same learning technique to creative writing. All I know about the structure of a story has come from reading books.</p>\n<p>We were asked to send a 1000 word piece to Maria (MJ Hyland) by email, and she and all the other class members would critique it. Usually, my short stories are received very positively by friends and the writer&#8217;s workshop I attend regularly in Bangalow. I was certainly flattered by Maria&#8217;s use of the word &#8216;talent&#8217; when describing my work&#8230;for she was ferocious when it came to dishing out criticism. If I was getting a little concerned, all was relieved when she then ripped into me for using stuffy high diction, amorphic adjectives, over summarising and words like &#8220;Hellish&#8221; instead of explaining what was so hellish about the situation. She told me I need to trust my writing style, and trust my narrative, and then I would have a good story. Above all else, avoid\u00a0clich\u00e9s.</p>\n<p>The workshop was fantastic (amorphic adjective). For the first time, someone gave me straightforward advice about how to improve as a writer. And she&#8217;s a famous author.</p>\n<p>At the festival today, I went armed with pen and paper, instead of nappies, and got as much from every session as humanly possible. I saw MJ Hyland speak again, Fiona McKintosh, Paul Kelly, Stephanie Dowrick, Bob Carr, Wendy Harmer, Benjamin Law, Richard Glover, Kate Vietch, and many others. From every session I took <em>something</em>, whether it was how the author plots their narrative, constructs their character, finds inspiration, investigates the dark side, utilises comedy or overcomes writer&#8217;s block. I learnt I need to read more (I don&#8217;t read at all) and if I want to be a writer&#8230;surprise surprise&#8230;I need to write more. My brain is fried banana this evening, but I am full to the brim with inspiration and excitement about all the possibilities that can come when these little fingers begin tap tap tapping away at the key board.</p>\n<p>We live in an age when there is so much more to being a stay-at-home mum. Life is rich, and full of interest. Mummies have talent, skills, run businesses&#8230;They might not clean as much as they used to, but somehow still manage to be caring attentive mummies. Full to the brim.</p>\n<p>[Note} You may have noticed a significant drop in blogging activity recently. The ability to sit down at a computer to write waxes and wanes. For the next week particularly, my blogging will certainly be waning, as two Psychology assignments and their impending due date have reared their heads, and any time spent blogging (as is my addiction) will be accompanied by extreme guilt.

You offer her water, and a little hand thrusts towards you and a little head turns away defiantly&#8230;&#8221;Not on your life! No way Mum!&#8221;\u00a0\u00a0But then comes negotiation, and it is so <em>easy</em>! All that is required to take phoney away, is <em>not</em> to take phoney away, but to ask if Elfie would like to give phoney to Daddy. Easy. To offer her water, you simply place the water in front of her, she takes it, and has a sip. As long as she is calling the shots, everything is fine.</p>\n<p>Our negotiation techniques span to table manners. I have never asked Elfie to say &#8216;Please&#8217; or &#8216;Thank you&#8217;. But because she is a curious sole, and one that wants to be part of the exciting adult world, she always says please and thank you &#8211; even sorry, because she hears us say it, and she is simply copying.</p>\n<p>So, for now at least we have a very &#8216;good girl&#8217; on our hands. A little tanty is quickly dissolved with a diversion. Resistance is met with negotiation. Who knows, maybe things will change.\u00a0And while she is a gorgeous, sweet, obliging personality, I am going to take some credit goddamnit.</p>\n<p>I saw a smartly dressed and intelligent looking woman at the park today (<a href=\"http://parkconfessional.com\" target=\"_blank\">Park Confessional\u00a0</a>- you might sympathise with this) berating her four year-old, publicly, humiliating him and herself by screaming at him to &#8220;Stop wheeling that thing around! Do NOT kick me, you little&#8230;&#8221; before hauling him, screaming, to sit on a park bench on his own. She turned away from him, as his cries were soon indistinguishable from the \u00a0cacophony of seagulls.</p>\n<p>Admittedly, I do not know the frustration of being the mother of a four year-old. But I sneakily suspect that getting angry at a child in public,and \u00a0hauling insult at him or her, is not teaching the child to behave. Rather, it is teaching the child how to respond in a frustrating situation &#8211; scream, kick, humiliate, and send the antagonist to sit alone on a park bench. Unsurprisingly, at the same playground a few days ago, a little girl came up to Elfie and shoved her. Elfie fell to the ground, and cried. Only moments later, the little girl returned, and pushed her again&#8230; It is little wonder that some children respond to a situation with violence and aggression.</p>\n<p>OK, so I am the smug owner of one perfect child. I know things won&#8217;t always be so, and I am bracing myself for the rollercoaster of strong will and defiance. I can only do my best, as a parent, by setting a good example, and as a friend said this morning, offering love.

She can, but she just chooses to grab our hand any opportunity she can to assist her. And why not?! This is one milestone amongst many, including:<br />\n&#8211; Eats with a spoon (occasionally, and very messily!)<br />\n&#8211; Throws food on the floor (a spin off from using a spoon)<br />\n&#8211; Talks (babbles)<br />\n&#8211; Says most animal noises (moo, baa, roar, eeeoohh [elephant], eee ooo [monkey], meow, woof woof&#8230;the list goes on)<br />\n&#8211; Climbs on everything, including very tall play gyms<br />\n&#8211; Destroys sandcastles (made by other people)<br />\n&#8211; Sits on adult furniture (looking very pleased with one&#8217;s self)<br />\n&#8211; Digs in the garden<br />\n&#8211; Draws (gesturing with a pen)<br />\n&#8211; Blows bubbles in the water<br />\n&#8211; Throws a ball<br />\n&#8211; Says the word &#8220;ball&#8221;</p>\n<p>And so on and so forth. It is amazing how much a child learns in a day. And I am sure as they grow, the learning capacity grows.</p>\n<p>And as the new year becomes, well, old hat really, we have decided to revisit our ultra relaxed parenting ways and introduce an element of structure into our routines. Now I wouldn&#8217;t say we are creating a monster &#8211; rather an\u00a0<em>angel &#8211;\u00a0</em>but I am starting to see how a lack of clear boundaries equals a tumultuous and unnecessarily messy life. Our new boundaries are simple: When Elka eats, she needs minimal distractions, such as cutlery, or empty cups. She gets to sole attention of at least one parent until a reasonable portion of her meal is finished. After dinner, she can play, and draw etc. then shower, then read, then bed. For most parents, this probably sounds normal&#8230;we had always eaten as a family, and whilst Elka had always been an excellent eater, we were detecting a slight demise in focus &#8211; cutlery, food and empty cups were being flung across the verandah, and very little food was going in the trap. Then there would be a bit of a fit, then a struggle to bath, and go to bed. Anyway, tonight, after a little serenading on the guitar from Daddy, we had a peaceful and beautiful evening&#8230;</p>\n<p>The start of more to come.</p>\n", "post_id": 31, "location": false, "date": "06-04-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["friends", "happiness", "10/10", "children", "family"], "text": "<p>Tonight, over the dinner table, Granny Annie randomly asked us both: &#8216;Out of 10, how happy are you?&#8217;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_320\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/homepage.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-320\" title=\"Little Pikelet\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/homepage.jpg?w=250&#038;h=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Little Pikelet</p></div>\n<p>G said 7&#8230;I said 10.

When I rate my overall state of happiness, I have to say it&#8217;s generally 10 out of 10.</p>\n<p>It hasn&#8217;t always been so. I had many blue teenage days, crying myself stupid. I took those days with me to Brisbane, Melbourne and London. I&#8217;ve had crappy relationships, and stressful jobs. At times, I would have thought a 10 out of 10 was impossible.</p>\n<p>In Year 12, I had the most amazing art teacher. I used to write madly in my visual art diary, never thinking anyone would actually read my illegible scribble. Then one day, I found a little comment in red pen that my art teacher had left me, like an easter egg hidden under a leaf. The comment said: &#8220;You have the ingredients to be <em>really</em>\u00a0happy, Zanni&#8221;. At the time, although it was very touching, I couldn&#8217;t believe the comment could be true. I was so miserable so much of the time. Real happiness was unattainable, or so it seemed.</p>\n<p>I have done a lot of work since and I have had a lot of experiences. And I can honestly say that the last 5 or more years have been a 10 out of 10 on average. Sure, I have days when the scale slides down to a lowly 8 or maybe even 7, but it never lasts long until it springs back up.\u00a0It&#8217;s a lot to do with my beautiful, loving husband, who sees me as I am, and brings the best out in me. It has a lot to do with everything I have learned. It has a lot to do with my beautiful friends. It has a lot to do with being silly, and affectionate. It has a lot to do with living in a beautiful environment. And these days, especially, it has a lot to do with one very special little girl, whose face is as round as a pikelet, who throws her head back to laugh as she tells a story to a stranger in the most animated way, who puts her cheek on mine and her arm over my body as she falls asleep singing <em>Hallelujah</em>.</p>\n<p>I know I am lucky, and a lot of people have much to struggle with. I am sure I will face my own struggles along the way, but for now, I am just so grateful for the people I have in my life, for my strength, for my health. Have a lovely Sunday night, everyone.

More will come. It sounded like I brushed her teeth more than most people. When I told my Mum I was taking her to the dentist, she wondered why, and questioned why I didn&#8217;t take fluoride tablets when I was pregnant and breastfeeding&#8230;What?? \u00a0This is the first I have heard of such a thing!\u00a0\u00a0I always thought water had fluoridation. Because we eat very healthily and drink water\u00a0and not\u00a0juice, I wouldn&#8217;t dream we could have a problem. Both G and I have great, healthy teeth.\u00a0I have since read a few things to suggest that you can&#8217;t buy fluoride tablets anymore &#8211; it isn&#8217;t considered safe. The safest thing is water\u00a0fluoridation, a little bit of fluoride in toothpaste, and a healthy diet.</p>\n<p>Having visited the dentist this morning with Elfie, however, I wish, as one always does in this situation, that I had listened to my mother instinct &#8211; I knew my daughter&#8217;s teeth weren&#8217;t as they should be, and now she might have tooth decay. One very sad mumma {sigh audibly}.</p>\n<p>Apparently I live in one of the few places in Australia where the water hasn&#8217;t fluoridation. I haven&#8217;t looked into the issue enough to know if this is a good or bad thing. According to WHO and my dentist and other doctors and dentists, water\u00a0fluoridation\u00a0is the safest way to prevent tooth decay, as well as eating well. But I suppose there are other issues.</p>\n<p>I am, generally, a <em>mother el naturale</em>. My child sleeps in our bed, I breastfed for 15 months, I still carry her in the Ergo to sleep. But I do very, very strongly agree with childhood vaccination and now I am starting to believe in water fluoridation. I am very sad this morning that my incredibly healthy daughter at the age of 19 months has tooth decay, and until another appointment with the dentist, we won&#8217;t know if it is congenital or something I did during my pregnancy or other.</p>\n<p>Good things that have come out of today are that I learnt how to brush Elfie&#8217;s teeth well, our community dentist was lovely, and completely accommodating to the need&#8217;s of a 19 month-old, and maybe we caught the tooth decay early enough to prevent it from becoming worse.</p>\n<p>What are your thoughts about water fluoridation? Is it a good thing? Safe? What are the arguments against it? Please, say your piece.

She has gone from pram or car or sling or snuggles to just sling, and I realised today that this is a good thing. Imagine if she only took her day sleep in a cot &#8211; I would have no excuse to go on a strenuous walk in the middle of the day to give her a sleep. Granted, she weighs 13 kg, but this just adds to the adventure.</p>\n<p>Thursday we discovered a new walk around Broken Head-land. Australia, and NSW in particular, is not famous for its choreographed walks &#8211; we have so much damn space, most of it is wild, and impossible to walk through &#8211; Must Drive Car. So when you find a new walk, one with a bannister to stop you falling off the cliff, it is very exciting.</p>\n<p>Saturday we trekked up to the Byron Bay lighthouse. It rained &#8211; actually, it poured. I was legging it up the last bit of mountain to reach shelter, as I carried Elfie in the sling. We stopped momentarily under the verandah of what I thought was a public building, but was told to &#8216;Move On, Private Property&#8217;. Where is the heart? The rich lady who lives next to Byron Bay lighthouse didn&#8217;t even have the graciousness to let a poor, soaked mum shelter herself and her sleeping baby from the torrential rain. At least she asked politely.</p>\n<p>And today we took Elfie&#8217;s sleep to Mt Warning. We were in the region anyway, and thought what the heck, let&#8217;s do as much of the trek as we can. Elfie was with Dad and I ran as much as I could. Power Mum.</p>\n<p>So my 14 day fitness challenge died in the ass, but the fitness still lives on.

One parent, or grandparent, was always on Elka duty and the other was free to work or wash up or whatever.<br />\nAnd as you will see in the last post, there was a slowly escalating drama over tea time&#8230;again, Elka called the shots, and things were getting a bit crazy.</p>\n<p>I am not a big fan of reading up, but I was getting to the point where I needed to read something to give me a picture of how to handle the situation.</p>\n<p>And then I came across this article: &#8220;Who&#8217;s in control?&#8221; by Jean Liedloff\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.continuum-concept.org/reading/whosInControl.html\">http://www.continuum-concept.org/reading/whosInControl.html</a></p>\n<p>It is very interesting reading, and gave me a very useful insight. The next day (ie yesterday) was consequently one of the nicest days I have ever had with Elka. I was dreading the day a little, as we had been up MANY times that night and Greg was working all day, and it was raining, so not even the garden was an option. But I had a new tool &#8211; an understanding that I am boss, and as a parent, Elka needs my leadership, not the other way round. And so the day unfolded without whinging or crying, just lovely beautiful cuddles, lots of reading and playing, me doing the washing up, the laundry, the sweeping and the cooking (none or few of which I usually achieve). Elka ate all her dinner happily, and went to bed like a little angel. I listened to her needs, she apparently listened to mine, and we got on famously!</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not force. Or control. Or authority. It&#8217;s a subtle playing out of leadership. Elka is a very little lady, and she looks to the adults and the older children for direction about what to do next. I am all for baby-led parenting when it comes to when to feed, when to sleep etc. but it was high time I took some leadership in the parenting department.

Dark clouds have formed on the horizon, and are encroaching. Surfers in black suits cluster around the break point. I am walking. My baby sleeps against my chest, snuggled into the sling. My legs are heavy weights. Like lead they drag beneath me and reluctantly lift with each step. And still the clouds gather above.</p>\n<p>I am walking down now, towards the water, and from where I am, I see dolphins playing on the waves. They show off to one another. A surfer drifts along. He, or is it a she? glides next to a dolphin.</p>\n<p>Now it is raining. At first a speck drops and melts on my baby&#8217;s eyelid. The specks multiply until the rain is sheeting. I run, pulling my black rain jacket over my head and over the sleeping baby, so only her face is poking out. Her face wet. Her nose twitches as the drops gather.</p>\n<p>I dive under the barbecue shelter. A bride and groom and their photographer sprint towards the shelter and crowd next to me. A symphony of tympani plays out on the tin roof. The bride&#8217;s sculpted hair is collapsing &#8211; strands dyed blond stick to her face. A flower hangs above her ear. Mascara streaks her cheeks. She pulls a pink and white check surf-brand jacket over her bare shoulders, covering the large tatoo of a star on her shoulder-blade. The groom yelps as he lurches into the rain to collect three plastic champagne glasses that the wind has carried away. I exchange looks with the photographer. The bride rolls her eyes and shivers.</p>\n<p>&#8216;I told them it was risky business, coming out here in this weather,&#8217; the photographer yells, but his voice is barely a whisper under the symphony. Drops have gathered on his terracotta moustache. He cradles his camera in both hands. He towers over me, and gazes at where my breasts are, but he is looking at the baby, whose face is now dripping. I pull my dry jumper sleeve over my hand and pat her dry. She twitches again, threatening to wake.</p>\n<p>I am relieved the rain has given my legs a rest.</p>\n<p>It stops. The surfers hunched over their boards sit up and disperse.

I pulled up bindiis one by one, while the little one scurried around with a bare bum and red gum boots, filling dolly&#8217;s tea-pot with soil, and drawing across the concrete bricks in chalk. Just me and the little one. Occasionally, she would come to me with a: &#8220;Mummy?&#8221; and I would say, &#8220;Yes, darling,&#8221; and she would say, &#8220;Dodle upa-alotle, dotle, upanupa?&#8221;. And I would nod, and agree, and then we would hold hands and sing ring-a-ringa-rosie and all fall down together in a patch of grass where no bindiis grew. And then I would resume digging grass, or plucking weeds, and she would resume wandering around the garden.\n<p><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-360\" title=\"Ergo\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/ergo.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" />We stopped for lunch, and ate sausages and bread under the shade of a tree in the garden. I drank tea, Elfie drank water.\n<p>And then we played with toys in the bath, the day&#8217;s red soil turning the bath water brown. We ate prawn salad together for dinner. She at most of the prawns. Then she helped me wash up. We read together, sitting side by side on the couch. And we did our bed-time routine, brushed teeth, drank milk etc. until at last, we lay together on the family bed and fell asleep.</p>\n<p>\nWhy was it again I was itching to arrange for us to be busy today? I can&#8217;t remember, now.\n<p>The truth is, it felt wonderful, moving from one activity to the next. Sometimes it was a mummy directed activity, such as folding washing, and at other times it was an Elfie directed activity, such as strapping dolly to the back as if in a sling using a scarf, and walking around the garden. I wasn&#8217;t thinking about the next five minutes, or the next. Elfie is such divine company.\n<p>Having a child has been a lesson in living in the moment. Of not hanging out for the future visit from a friend, or the time to check my email. As my little daughter grows into a bigger one, we form a friendship, which at this stage is based on silly language, hugs, and kisses. And one day might be based on affectionate, yet philosophical conversation. Here&#8217;s to the moment, to my day spent with a little one.</p>\n", "post_id": 359, "location": false, "date": "08-29-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["write on wednesday", "writing"], "text": "<p>As a recent member of <a href=\"http://inkpaperpen.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Write on Wednesdays</a>, I have been honoured to read some wonderful pieces of writing, and know that my stories are being read by others&#8230;</p>\n<p>Today I read the most beautiful story on <a href=\"http://therhythmmethod.wordpress.com/2011/08/31/write-on-wednesdays-the-fight/\">The Rhythm Method</a>\u00a0&#8211; it is incredible, moving, so sad, and the author is so brave.

Oh no!! My sweet little angel, so gorgeous and perfect, has decaying teeth&#8230;</p>\n<p>The irony is that we specifically ensured she didn&#8217;t eat sugar. She had a few sweet things on occasion, like honey on her bread, and her little face came up in red blotches. We thought that if sugar isn&#8217;t a regular part of her diet, she won&#8217;t miss it. I have also been brushing her teeth, semi-consistently, for months now, thinking I was doing the right thing.</p>\n<p>Since our<a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.com/2011/08/19/community-announcement-dental-health/\" target=\"_blank\"> last visit to the dentist</a>, when the phrase &#8220;tooth decay&#8221; was first uttered, I poured through Wikipedia, and other equally credible websites to try to\u00a0discover the cause of my baby&#8217;s plight, and especially to see if there was something I could do to reverse proceedings.</p>\n<p>I came across <a href=\"http://wholehealthsource.blogspot.com/2009/03/reversing-tooth-decay.html\" target=\"_blank\">studies</a>\u00a0that support the fact that tooth decay can reverse. The idea is the tooth is like an organ, in need of nourishment, and given the right ingredients, it can restore to health. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weston_Price\" target=\"_blank\">Dr Weston Price&#8217;s</a> name emerges repeatedly &#8211; he was a dentist that promoted the relationship between teeth, health and physical exercise. \u00a0Dr. Edward Mellanby and his wife provided evidence that diets high in calcium and vitamin D and low in phytic acid, which prevents mineral absorption, had significant effect on tooth health and a reduced incidence of tooth decay. You can read more about their study at <a href=\"http://wholehealthsource.blogspot.com/2009/03/reversing-tooth-decay.html\" target=\"_blank\">Whole Food Health blog</a>.</p>\n<p>One of the foods that is high in phytic acid is oat. When I ran through what we could have possibly done wrong for Elfie to need fillings at 20months, one of the things I realised was that for a few months we were giving her a bottle of oat milk before bed every night. I had got it into\u00a0my head that dairy is a big no no, because of lactose intolerance and all that. So I substituted with oat, which Elfie liked just as well. I mentioned it to the dentist today, and she agreed that oat, rice and soya milks are not so great for little teeth, particularly after brushing at night. They are carbohydrates &#8211; sugars. The other thing I thought of was that Elfie had to have antibiotics recently for impetigo, and they lace it with syrup to make the medicine go down. The medicine went down a treat, but according to the dentist, a layer of syrup was coating the little girl&#8217;s teeth every night and joining union with mouth bacteria to form a lovely little tooth decay party.</p>\n<p>Of course, those incidents were fairly minimal, so it is unlikely they were the be all and end all of Elfie&#8217;s tooth decay. My other theory is that her teeth came very very early. At 2months she had the first four, and she has had all her molars and incisors since about 8-9months. She now has her 3year-old molars. Her teeth are very very fine. Maybe that has contributed. Also, she didn&#8217;t teeth as such, so wasn&#8217;t a very bitey child. My theory is that the gnawing on hard objects to relieve tooth pain is also adaptive as it strengthens teeth. My third theory is that we didn&#8217;t start brushing until she was over a year old, and even then it was always a quick suck of the toothpaste from the toothbrush and be done. Only recently have I committed to making sure she properly brushes her teeth morning and night &#8211; after milky drink.</p>\n<p>So, there you go. Every child is different, but this child obviously needed a little bit of special tooth attention. Maybe we could not have prevented her tooth decay. We will never know for sure. All I can do now is brush her teeth regularly, and encourage a diet high in calcium and vit D and low in phytic acid. This is easy &#8211; Elfie loves milk, cheese, yoghurt, fish, and veges. Yay.</p>\n", "post_id": 368, "location": false, "date": "09-02-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["write on wednesday"], "text": "<p><em><strong>Write On Wednesdays Exercise 13 &#8211; A Great One Liner&#8230;</strong>This week you need to come up with one good line to describe a part of your day.

The urge was primal. On my knees, I scraped soil with my bare hands. The project was a flower garden.</p>\n<p>Our backyard has gone from jungle to sparse bindi-covered lawn in a matter of months, and now I am planting, and regenerating. Giving it life once more. We inherited it from my Grandma Joyce, whose philosophy was to grow and let grow. Her garden always flourished&#8230; with herbs, hibiscus, poinciana and poinsettia. As she aged, it became too much for her to do anything in the garden except sprinkle seeds into pots and water them every day. Mr Clifford had passed away years ago, and her son, who was \u00a0in charge of mowing the grass, could never seem to do the job to Joyce&#8217;s high expectations.</p>\n<p>Joyce&#8217;s garden was always synonymous with her. At her request, I painted her coffin, and I chose to paint her favourite flowers, or flowers that we collectively decided represented her.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-397\" style=\"border-color:initial;border-style:initial;\" title=\"Hanging shells\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/p1010773.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></p>\n<div>\n<p>When we moved in to Joyce&#8217;s house last September, the garden was my first project. A <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cestrum_nocturnum\" target=\"_blank\">night-blooming jasmine</a> had taken over and swallowed an entire part of the backyard. It had become entangled with ivy, and the two plants grew over several trees. There\u00a0was a thick carpet of ferns, and in parts, jasmine and ferns had grown wild together. In some ways, it was beautiful. But the down-side was that half the garden had disappeared.</p>\n<p>An enormous poinciana\u00a0shaded most of the garden. \u00a0In a storm one night, its largest branch collapsed. Two days later, Elfie and her little friend were playing in the garden with dollies. They came over to where my friend and I were sitting, and within seconds, a second branch fell from the tree exactly where the girls were playing. A frightening near-miss. Sadly, we cut the tree down. Its trunk provided us firewood, and now the rustic border of a vege patch. The other consequence of the poinciana\u00a0is that in its shade, no grass grew, only a thick carpet of bindis, which Elfie quickly discovered, are very unpleasant. Hence our latest challenge&#8230;</p>\n<p>The garden is the place that Elfie and I can play side by side, for hours. Slathered in sunscreen and usually without a nappy, Elfie explores endlessly. The vege patch border is her train, and the wheel barrow her carriage. Her current obsession is watering plants, since we bought her a small, red watering can. We play, we discover, we create. Although our garden is not the prettiest place in the world, made from found objects and remnants from Joyce&#8217;s life, I think it is my favourite place for the sanctuary it provides.</p>\n<p>Our garden has been my sanctuary and my healer. <em>What is gardening to you?

To begin with, I started training to become a <a href=\"http://www.lifeline.org.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Lifeline</a> counsellor a couple of weeks ago. As part of the training, I attended a weekend <a href=\"http://www.livingworks.net/page/Applied%20Suicide%20Intervention%20Skills%20Training%20(ASIST)\" target=\"_blank\">ASIST</a> workshop run by <a href=\"http://www.livingworks.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">LivingWorks</a>, which is a suicide intervention first aid.</p>\n<p>As predicted, it was a pretty heavy course. We began by sharing our personal experience with suicide, and I was flabbergasted by the number of people in the group who had had very close experiences with suicide, whether it was attempts on their own life, or a person very close to them had either attempted or completed a suicide. Some people had had multiple experiences with suicide.</p>\n<p>When you look at the statistics, this isn&#8217;t that surprising given that over 2,000 people commit suicide per year, there are an additional 15-25% of unconfirmed suicides, and over a million people are reported to have suicidal thoughts per year. Suicide is the highest cause of death in young people. The statistics are frightening, especially given that most people won&#8217;t report suicidal thoughts, many suicides are ambiguous, and there are many incomplete suicides.</p>\n<p>The workshop used an extremely functional model of intervention, which basically provides skills to recognise that someone may be thinking about suicide, how to reach out to help, explore options with the person, and together, devise a plan to keep them safe. Who knows if, in a real situation, I could actually do a successful intervention, but at least I feel slightly more prepared to help if I ever encounter a person who is considering suicide.</p>\n<p>Many of us have been touched by suicide. Some very closely. Some very recently.</p>\n<p>I am sure you have all seen the Facebook, Twitter or television advertising letting you know that today is national<a href=\"http://www.ruokday.com.au/content/home.aspx\" target=\"_blank\"> R U OK? Day</a>. Today is about bringing awareness to the issue of suicide, and encouraging us to ask people Are You OK? Sometimes, reaching out is all it takes. So many suffer in isolation, and when problems mount, and feelings are so low, feeling alone can be all it takes.</p>\n<p>I would just like to acknowledge<a href=\"http://www.ruokday.com.au/content/home.aspx\" target=\"_blank\"> today</a>, and all the beautiful people who have been lost to suicide. And I would like to ask you, R U OK? \u00a0I am always ready to listen.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "post_id": 387, "location": false, "date": "09-15-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["write on wednesday", "writing"], "text": "<div><strong><em>Write on Wednesday Exercise 14 &#8211; The Mighty Mighty Rewrite&#8230;</em></strong></div>\n<div><em>I did a workshop with literary author\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.mjhyland.com/\">MJ Hyland</a>, who teaches Masters in Creative Writing at Manchester University.

It is generally self-conscious, full of apologies and excuses. Another commonly used name for mum dance is <em>Zumba</em>.</p>\n<p>For whatever reason, up until now, I have been in denial. In my mind&#8217;s eye, I am a sexy, slim 20-year-old with no cellulite and great muscle tone. Unfortunately, the mirror at the gym told me today that I am actually more pear-shaped than slim, and I definitely have cellulite. And I am definitely not 20. Or perhaps it was the 20-year-old, toned Zumba instructor who made me feel old&#8230;and incredibly uncoordinated.</p>\n<p>I am no stranger to dancing. I started at about the age of 5. I danced at eisteddfods, much to the anxiety of my mother and grandmother, who cringed behind crumpled programs at the back of the town hall. I dressed as a bear, an erotic 8 year-old porn star and a French artist. I joined the dancing crew in year 5 and 6 and we took it to state level, we were so splendid. Further to those junior dancing days, I have been boogey-ing on the dance floor at every given occasion. Although no dance expert, I could string a few moves together and look somewhat graceful.</p>\n<p>At weddings and twenty-firsts, I would look around me sympathetically, but kindly at the mums and the dads in the room, shaking their booties and being ever so &#8216;cool&#8217;.

Not me.</p>\n<p>And here I was today at Zumba, in a class full of grandmas, and I indeed found myself mum dancing. It was sad.</p>\n<p>On a slightly more positive note, it was incredibly fun.

We left around 7pm after speeches and she slept the whole way home.</div>\n<div>At the funeral of my grandma, we were fortunate to have Granny Annie staying at the time, so Annie took her for a walk during the service.</div>\n<div>At Elfie&#8217;s second wedding, she was a celebrity.

She ran around the church gardens, her head thrown back, crowing &#8220;COCK-A-DOCKLE-DOOOO!&#8221;. She clung to my skirt for during\u00a0the garden party reception, at some point lying down to gaze at the sky with her fingers in her ears. During dinner, she ran between Mum and I, then ate an adult-sized portion, plus dessert. About 10, she started to look pretty exhausted, so I dressed her in her footed jammies, and thought just maybe I could send her on the bus back to the hotel with my Dad, who at 70, was looking just as tired. She adamantly stomped her little jammie-clad feet when the band began, as she wanted to dance. I tried to explain to her that the bride and groom needed to have the first dance, so we waited and then, when she could wait no longer, we made our way to the dance floor, at which time the poor little thing collapsed with exhaustion in a crying heap. The bus back to town had pulled up, and I realised, sadly, that there was no way my little girl was going to peacefully fall asleep in Dad&#8217;s arms, so I too left the wedding. Mum came with us to accompany the 70 year-old man home.</div>\n<div>Sitting in the hotel room at 10.30pm, my mum and I felt a little cheated, having to leave the wedding early&#8230;we weren&#8217;t even tipsy! But then, with grace, I accepted my fate. My little girl had partied hard till a good hour, and had allowed me to do the same. Occasionally the fantasy of leaving her with a babysitter, who would put her to bed, crosses my mind. But I know Elfie, and I know it would not go down. After all, a 10.30\u00a0curfew\u00a0isn&#8217;t too bad for a mother in my situation. Really, I have made few sacrifices, and the upshot is my Elfie, in all her beauty, who I wouldn&#8217;t change in a billion years.</div>\n", "post_id": 413, "location": false, "date": "10-11-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["play", "children", "family", "play dough"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/scentedplaydough.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-417\" title=\"Scented Rainbow Playdough\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/scentedplaydough.jpg?w=250&#038;h=300\" alt=\"\"   /></a>\u00a0This gorgeous idea came from my good friend, Ellie.</p>\n<p>The play dough\u00a0recipe is from the back of the Cream of Tartar packet, bought from Coles.

At school, I never had a sick day, I loved it so much. Yes, I was a 5 gold star goody-two-shoes. But it wasn&#8217;t the books and the teachers &#8211; it was the other students. I hated having to stay home for the day because it was so boring. Not much has changed {sigh}.</p>\n<p>3. I first had my heart broken in Year 6 by a guy I never even spoke to. My heart was broken many times before meeting the gorgeous love of my life, Greg, who is now my husband.</p>\n<p>4. We got married in the gardens of a sweet little church in a country village called Eureka, which looks over my favourite view in the world. Pete Murray also\u00a0married there.</p>\n<p>5. I don&#8217;t like scary things, like theme park rides.</p>\n<p>6. I am a cautious driver.</p>\n<p>7. When I see people hit their children in public, or hear parents boasting about how they smack their kids, I want to run over and tell them off, but I don&#8217;t have the guts.</p>\n<p>8. I want to please everyone, as much as possible.</p>\n<p>9. I wish my brother and I could put our fights behind us, and be the friends I know we can be.</p>\n<p>10.

Crazy nights, no sleep, crazy kids losing their shite in the supermarket&#8230;Just kidding.\u00a0I can totally see why people travel overseas with kids, especially when they are visiting amazing family in San Francisco &#8211; more specifically, Kentfield, CA, the most impeccable and delightful suburb I have ever set foot in. Even the geese are perfect. But we have been in the throes of jet lag, and truthfully, it sucks a bit.</p>\n<p>The flight itself over was better than anticipated. I got in two movies, and my mum got in three plus a TV show. We had a seat beside us, and heaps of leg room, and Elka entertained herself most of the flight by playing with stickers, sitting on our feet or our knees, and talking to herself. She loved visits to the bathroom, and would dance in front of the mirror. She didn&#8217;t sleep a lot, which is fair enough, given that we were flying over in our day time. What kid in their right mind would sleep in simulated darkness? She eventually went off at what would have been her Australian bedtime, and was rudely woken three hours later by dinner, and then embarking the airplane. Considering she had the shortest night&#8217;s sleep in sleep&#8217;s history, she went so well through LA&#8217;s customs, baggage claim, baggage check, security check and breakfast at *Starbucks* or *Burger King* thank you very much. Only in the last 10 minutes of the connecting flight to San Francisco did she begin to fall to pieces. Poor little angel.</p>\n<p>We arrived about 12pm Californian time. She napped for a couple of hours in the afternoon, and I am pretty sure it was a mistake to then wake her for dinner, as she was a complete mess, then refused to sleep at all. Eventually she cried herself to sleep in my arms, and proceeded to wake through the night, screaming. Miraculously, her sleeping cousins in nearby rooms slept soundly.</p>\n<p>The second night was probably worse. She wouldn&#8217;t go to sleep, and when she eventually did, she woke only an hour later, screaming like crazy. No-one could calm her. I eventually got her up, and we watched the end of our movie. Getting her to bed at 11pm was impossible. I used all my tricks &#8211; bottles, singing, and even pacing the room with her in the sling. Eventually, she collapsed in my arms, probably after I had fallen asleep.</p>\n<p>Her days have largely been fine. Her sweet 3-year-old cousin wants to hug and kiss her continuously, which Elka is slowly getting used to. She is obsessed with her baby cousins. She had a minor breakdown in the supermarket &#8211; I think it was over a confusion about whether to push the cute little red trolley or be pushed in one. I bustled her out of there, away from the critical gazes of the fiercely neat Kentfield shoppers.</p>\n<p>Desperate for a normal night tonight, I have resorted to drugging my daughter. Not the Phenergan type drugs my father preferred, or marijuana or anything like that. I went with the wholesome, natural, hippy-type Valerian crossed with camomile, and she fell asleep as her head hit the pillow. Albeit she had a little spew, though I probably would have too after 1000 blueberries, 1000 strawberries, and two bottles of milk. She is sleeping now, and fingers crossed, she will stay asleep.</p>\n<p><em>So here&#8217;s to the opportunity to diarise our San Fran trip so far. Have you ever travelled with children?

I never thought this trip would be possible given our meagre income. However, my mum and dad visited San Fran earlier in the year and on their return decided to send Elka and me to meet Elka&#8217;s cousins. Boy, am I glad they did.</p>\n<p>Little Mr G is 3 and a bit and his sister, Little Miss P, is 7 months. Both are sweeties. Mr G met Elka when she was first-born, and once again when she was 8 months. He has spent a lot of time talking about her since. And here she is in his very own home &#8211; flesh and blood. Mr G likes to shower her with kisses and hugs, persistently, and Elka, being a space conscious gal, has decided to accept his affection only sometimes, which can be\u00a0a cause for concern. Many a time, she does a mighty protest, which only makes her cousin want to hug her more.</p>\n<p>Little Miss P is too sweet. She has a shock of chocolate locks and vivid blue eyes. When she looks at you, she beams, then laughs, and you can&#8217;t help being enamored by her. She just rolls around on the floor while the big cousins sort out their stuff.</p>\n<p>Elka&#8217;s other special cousin, Little Miss F, lives in the heart of the bay, and is a little doll. She is almost the same age as P. The other night, us sisters + mum celebrated the night with wine and yummy food, while the little Miss F gazed at us, so sweetly, so mildly. I don&#8217;t think I have heard her cry once. She is a wonder.</p>\n<p>Elka is obsessed with the babies. I am not surprised, as she spends her life mothering plastic dolls bought from Vinnie&#8217;s. Her face lights up, and she will drop anything, even a tussle with Mr G, just to sit and gaze admiringly at the bay-bees, as she calls them, in a thick Australian accent. The only way I managed to make all the presents for family before we left was to tell her they were for the babies, so she stood by me in solidarity and talked about &#8220;Holding bay-bee&#8221; and &#8220;Ahhhh&#8230;sing Alleluya?&#8221; &#8220;Yes, my sweetest of peas,&#8221; I would respond.</p>\n<p>And when not having little tussles, the bigger of the cousins, Elka and Mr G, have a riot together. They have sat outside each night at this cute little red picnic table to eat their dinner, which is more a case of run-and-throw-a-ball-and-chase-each-other than dinner. I captured a little scene of the two of them bouncing balls in a terribly smart shopping mall in Marin County, running around each other like crazy, and squealing. It&#8217;s not all fun and games&#8230;they have been educating each other as well. Elka has taught Mr G and thing or two about stuffing wild and exotic foods like cucumber in his mouth. &#8220;Watching Elka eat, Mr G?&#8221; is a phrase commonly heard during meal times. And Mr G has taught Elka a thing or two about tooth brushing and going to bed in a normal fashion. Seeing G brush his teeth was very inspiring, apparently, and we got a good 3 minute toothbrushing in this evening. Farewell thee tooth decay! Thank you G!</p>\n<p>And another <em>big</em> thank you to G from Aunty Me for inspiring a sweet bed time routine. If there has been one very repetitive theme on this blog, it has been that of sleeping. Phew! It&#8217;s been a mission for me&#8230;and Elka too I suspect. I have long been convinced that the issue has been that Elka was born with a defective lie-down-and-relax gene. Lying in a bed has always seemed to be a torture for her. But seeing that Mr G sidle\u00a0up to his beautiful, comfortable looking bed with his <a href=\"http://www.cloudb.com/\" target=\"_blank\">sleep sheep</a> going and his night-light on, and what the? going to sleep! deeply inspired me at least. After lying with Elka for many many many (every) night for almost an hour some nights waiting for her to go to sleep, I have finally cracked it. The other night I gave her a dose of relaxing herbs in her milk, did the whole bed time routine, and turned on her new <a href=\"http://www.cloudb.com/\" target=\"_blank\">stars</a> (care of Aunty Starrs) and her sleep sheep, saturated her dolly in lavender oil and lay her down with a bottle and a little drop more of calming potion. I&#8217;m not giving any one of these things credit, because I am scared too change one, but the combination worked, and after two attempts to leave the room, I quietly excused myself. The very very docile Elka protested for about 5 seconds, then must have fell asleep, because that was that. She didn&#8217;t wake up again. We have done the same thing three nights in a row now&#8230;and fingers crossed, but I think Elka and I have just passed the biggest milestone of our life together.</p>\n<p>We don&#8217;t have much in the way of cousins for Elka at home. My brothers don&#8217;t seem to be in any want or state to be procreating. Sadly! I have fond memories of my youth growing up with cousins. Rolling around paddocks, ganging up on each other, writing and performing plays and choreographing dances to Michael Jackson songs (much to the amusement of our parents)&#8230;Gone are the days. I have consciously surrounded ourselves with friends, who I hope will play a cousin role in Elka&#8217;s younger life. Until another sneaky trip to San Francisco comes our way, that is&#8230;Always keen.

Things seem so reasonably priced, especially with the healthy Australian dollar. And did I mention things are <em>so\u00a0</em>beautiful?</p>\n<p>For example, we visited Baby Gap today. Previously I may have avoided such a place for some vague, ethical aversion against sweat shops, but I was lured in by the <em>50% off everything</em> sign out the front. Not only that, but the racks at the back had been marked down to $6 or something crazy, so $20 later, I walked out with a bunch of stylish kids clothes (including crazy pink, purple and black swirly leggings). I may have forsaken my ethical self on this occasion, but I sure satisfied my frugal one.</p>\n<p>My ethical self and my frugal self made a truce at Woodland&#8217;s fancy supermarket this afternoon when I picked up 2 tubes of environmentally friendly el naturale sunscreen for $9 each. In Australia, I think I pay about $27 for an equivalent bottle of sunscreen. And there we have so much sun, we need it relentlessly!</p>\n<p>My favourite shop has been <a href=\"http://www.anthropologie.com\" target=\"_blank\">Anthropologie\u00a0</a>. Every aesthetic bone in my body was satisfied by this incredible store. It sells fashionable, colourful, sexy clothes for women, original and inspiring home-wares, textiles&#8230;even door knobs. Gush. And everything was laid out beautifully. Stylish, creative, designer-type friends of mine, listen up. You <em>must </em>find and visit this store if ever you come to California. All I bought was a hand-woven letter &#8216;E&#8217; for Elka&#8217;s door &#8211; unfortunately I couldn&#8217;t afford to spell her name&#8230;but I couldn&#8217;t leave without at least one souvenir.</p>\n<p>So, fixing that leaky faucet, and turning that tap off tight. Until my next Californian adventure.</p>\n<p><em>Where is your shopping achilles heel?</em></p>\n", "post_id": 442, "location": false, "date": "10-27-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["imagination", "play", "children", "family", "playgrounds"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/park.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-452\" title=\"park\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/park.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<p>I heard an interesting radio program recently on ABC radio&#8217;s Radio National ~ <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/rn/lifematters/stories/2011/3336139.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Life Matters</a> (I am such a mum sometimes). Play advocate Tim Gill and play specialist Anita Bundy were interviewed about the importance of adventurous and creative playgrounds.</p>\n<p>Where I am from &#8211; the painfully neat village of Alstonville &#8211; parks are pretty predictable. The key feature is safety, of course. The grounds are soft and springy to cushion a fall, the slides are small and painfully boring, and the sea saws &#8211; well, our little neighbouring park has the smallest see saw I have ever seen. We have one interesting feature &#8211; the red climbing net that somewhat resembles the Eiffel Tower. It is the most popular, with young children and teenagers alike. I too have been known to do the odd climb and bounce.</p>\n<p>I have long suspected parks could be a little bit more interesting. Elka often spends a lot of time at the fringe, watching the others (bored, perhaps?). Generally, it is the bigger kids who get the most pleasure, as they tend to invent games within games, and their characters give the playgrounds a new zest.</p>\n<p>So, when I heard this program on Radio National, I listened in.</p>\n<p>The gist was that interesting playgrounds that allow children to invent, explore and discover have a far more impressive effect on children&#8217;s resourcefulness, ability to work together and creativity. It makes sense. Of course, councils need to take caution, and rip up all swings because children can get injured and parents can sue, but there are safe playgrounds that can also be interesting.</p>\n<p>I was impressed, for example, by the playgrounds we visited in California. The local Kentfield park borders a tennis court, a football oval and a beautiful, rugged marsh surrounded by mountains. The park has obviously been designed to integrate with the local surrounds. There are fibre-glass ducks to be climbed on, swings that don&#8217;t injure children, a tube slide, a sand pit with a tap&#8230;and best of all, a little tiny creek that runs through, where, with the push of a button, water trickles. There are spades provided and a little tiny pool of water for children to paddle.</p>\n<p>I was so impressed because even though the local parents are neat and perfect, with toned arms and blonde, straight hair, they very generously (and smartly), let their children get wet feet and bottoms, and paddle around. Elka was, quite literally, in heaven. On our second trip to this particular park, she bee-lined to the stream, paddled around, dug holes, caught water in her hands, and yes, got a wet bottom. If it wasn&#8217;t for my short attention span, I could have let her play there all day. She would have been content.</p>\n<p>My park education was furthered by a visit to the <a href=\"http://www.baykidsmuseum.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Bay Area Discovery Museum</a>, SF. There was an enormous network of a life-size ship wreck, a small cave, a boat children could climb on and prepare food, a room full of wooden trees that make music, an area with blue foam shapes that children could assemble, and a room filled with scraps of paper that children and their parents could cut up, stick together and make things with. There was a sign that read:</p>\n<p>&#8220;In Imagination Playground, children&#8217;s creativity flows when they:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Explore: Ask questions, experiment, think &#8220;what if&#8230;?&#8221;</li>\n<li>Discover: come up with original ideas, &#8220;ah-ha&#8221; moments that are powerful\u00a0intrinsic\u00a0motivators</li>\n<li>Immerse: enter a state known as &#8220;flow&#8221;, which is linked with creativity</li>\n<li>Imagine: transport themselves to different worlds, developing empathy</li>\n<li>Connect: re-organise different experiences into a new understanding of the world.</li>\n</ul>\n<div>This all made a lot of sense to me.</div>\n<div>The playgrounds of my own youth were paddocks, gullies and dams. I look back with amazement at the trust my parents had in us as we scoured the local bush land, feral and unkempt. My favourite place was an old olive tree, which was hollowed out, and I would sit within it for hours talking to the local family of bears and the resident king. And when the olive tree grew boring, Inverell was blessed with <a href=\"http://greenvalleyfarm.com.au/store/Default.asp\" target=\"_blank\">Green Valley Farm</a>\u00a0&#8211; the most random and potentially dangerous theme park in the world. The rides were made from tin, in loving memory of a couple&#8217;s daughter who passed away but dreamed of Disney Land. I remember the terrifying experience of being jolted along on the rickety &#8220;roller-coaster&#8221; and thinking there was a good chance it was going to run off its wobbly rails anytime soon.</div>\n<div>I am not suggesting councils sacrifice safety for adventure. But there must be some sort of compromise. Does everything need to be made of rubber? Couldn&#8217;t a bit of foliage or other natural product be inserted in there somewhere? Around my area, every park is a replica of itself. Surely, our park designers at least could be a bit more imaginative&#8230;and then, maybe our children can have an outdoor space to explore, create and interact with each other.</div>\n<div><em>Do you have good parks in your area?

I should have kept a journal of your baby months, but I was so busy being a mother, and trying to salvage what I could of myself before being a mother, that I haven&#8217;t done it until now. One day you might be interested to read about yourself as a baby \u2013 what your life was like then, before you can remember. And I want to write this down for myself, because I think mothers forget all the details too.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s begin at the beginning.</p>\n<p>Your Daddy and I lived in Melbourne in 2009. We had talked about having a baby, then one day decided to try for one, instead of embarking on a big trip around Nepal and Tibet. I&#8217;m glad we did, because the genes that came together formed you.</p>\n<p>My pregnancy was very happy and healthy. I never felt sick. I felt great most of the time. And during that time, we moved to Lismore, to be closer to my parents, and have a better lifestyle for you. We&#8217;d bought our house soon after we found out I was pregnant. It was a house on a hill in Lismore Heights. Aunty Jenny was terribly worried about me living on that hill in the heart of Lismore&#8217;s summer with a baby and only one car for the family, but I wasn&#8217;t worried at all. I was just so excited about your birth.</p>\n<p>We did a lot of preparation. Classes at the natural birth centre (which has since closed down, but was the hub through which we met most of our friends in the area), and yoga classes. Your due date came and went, then Christmas came and went, and then at last, on New Years Eve I went into labour. We were staying out at the natural birth centre \u2013 a beautiful property out of Lismore \u2013 having food with the midwife and the birth support. You were 13 days late. Santo had given me castor oil that day, and then at around 7pm I started going into labour. It was all relatively short \u2013 an incredibly strong and powerful sensation took over ever minute or so, and then by midnight I was fully dilated. You weren&#8217;t coming through though, so bum up in the air, your head crowning, we drove into Lismore Hospital. Dr Teoh delivered you with a little suction cap on your head. It was heaven to meet you. You came out red, and crying, and very long \u2013 4.2kg \u2013 all very good things. I think your Daddy cried. We were both so so happy, especially to see you were so healthy.</p>\n<p>Your first few hours were spent trying to suckle and sleeping. We headed back to birth centre only a few hours after y were born and were very pleased to see you went easily into the car. What a&nbsp;tiny little precious bundle to strap into car seats. I think we are still paying the price for that early car trip.<br />\nYour whole extended family came to visit when you were about 8 hours old. I was still awake and ecstatic, and we drank champagne and ate cake in your honour. The newspaper people came as well &#8211; you were the first baby for the decade in the northern rivers, and you very aptly pointed a distinct No.1 with your index finger when they took the photo. It\u2019s quite a famous photo amongst those who have seen it.</p>\n<p>The first few days you slept a lot, and I was very pleased to see you rarely cried. Then on the third day, we did a ceremonial bath for you, at which time my milk came in, and &nbsp;fed you for about 3 hours straight. Every time I&nbsp;tried to release myself, you cried, an this pattern continued for the next few months. You were an excellent feeder. But to get you to sleep was usually difficult. In the end, between Daddy an I, you were in the sling most of the day, then at night, you slept quite well, waking up occasionally to feed. We had you in our bed to begin with, then a little cradle near us, then a hammock, then back to the bed with us.</p>\n<p>Luckily Daddy was home many days in those early days, but days spent without him were hard for me. You cried a lot, and I wondered what I was dong wrong. Some people said you had colic, others sad you didn\u2019t sleep enough. I tried everything I could, but in the end, walking around the hot hills of Lismore in the January heat with you in the sling, with dummy, singing Leonard Cohen\u2019s Hallelujah was the only thing that worked. The pram was your nemesis; and as it turns out so was the car. That was probably our fault, as we drove a lot in those early days to Coorabell, where Starrs, Will and Griffin were staying with Magri and Richie, as it was so much cooler there.</p>\n<p>I did manage to write a book while you were in the sling. I\u2019d sit on the gym ball and wrote a book about foot care in aged care for TAFE. Very exciting stuff.</p>\n<p>By about three months, you changed a lot. You started to interact, and were quite peaceful a lot of the time. I was used to your sleep pattern by then. Three short sleeps during the day, then quick feeds about three times in the night. I brought you into our bed, and fell asleep with you, so I never really got tired.</p>\n<p>At 6 months, things were great. You ditched the dummy, and started to eat real food. You began with a whole avocado in one sitting, and proceeded to just about everything. Whole grains, yogurt, all fruits, all vegetables. Granny Annie arrived around your seventh month birthday &#8211; the day you sat up on your own for the first time.<br />\nApart from in the car or the pram you were very happy. We did a lot of walking with you in the back pack, and&nbsp;a lot of singing and playing. You started to love books, which we of course encouraged. We had a great month with Granny Annie; although during her stay sadly your great grandmother Joyce passed away. Joyce was trying to teach you how to clap, and when she was sick in hospital you were the only reason for her to smile. Every time you were around, she started interacting again, and perked up. It was beautiful.</p>\n<p>We had an excellent social life &#8211; we still do! We would go to Mums and Bubs once a week at the birth centre, with Ellie and Shelly, Tigerlilly and Kaia, Helene and Mirabelle, Sohie and Olive, Maraya and Lucah, Sariya and Lukah, Lucy and Issy, Jane and Josie &#8211; and many others. Now we go to different people\u2019s houses most days of the week, or go to Brunswick Heads, or Lennox\u2019s Lake Ainsworth, or the Alstonville pool. It\u2019s really fun. And you are extremely social especially with older kids and adults. You go up to anyone on the beach and help make (destroy) their sandcastle.</p>\n<p>We have a very happy time at home. Daddy and I are always making silly jokes and songs. He only works 3.5 days a week, so is around a lot. We always eat breakfast and dinner together, and for a while now, you eat what we eat. I call you a skally sometimes, because you pretty much do as you please&#8230;stand and eat, sit on the table and eat. I guess we are very lenient! You love walking everywhere, holding our hands. At around 13 month, you did do steps on your own, but you are a smart chicken and still prefer to walk assisted. You climb on everything. Chairs, tables, our bed. Your favourite thing is to lead us into the bedroom where we have a king mattress and a single mattress pressed into the wall, and we all roll around, laughing.</p>\n<p>You still breastfeed a&nbsp;fair bit. I can\u2019t see you giving up any time soon. I have to say, I am an excellent Mummy and I hope you will always appreciate the fact that I never let you cry on your own, I breastfeed you to sleep at night, and through the night whenever you wake. Sometimes it takes an hour to get you to sleep at first. But I choose this way of parenting &#8211; it feels more natural and normal than trying to create rules and guidelines for how you should sleep. You are a baby! And you have the rest of your life to be educated, and law-bound.</p>\n<p>We are pretty convinced you are the most intelligent baby on the north coast. This morning when you did a pee on the carpet, you took my underwear which were close by and began to mop up your pee-spill. It was incredibly cute. You are a great conversationalist too. Since you were about 11 months old, you have never stopped talking. Your consonants are all very clear and well pronounced. You warble, and have this amazing intonation, looking directly at your listener and telling them something, quite clearly, in your own language. We do understand the animal sounds you make. Moo was the first one, then woof, now its bbbrrr (horse), snort for pig, ee oo for a monkey, eeiii for an elephant, and rrr for a lion. They are excellent. You understand so much! When I say \u201ccan you please get your book about Old McDonald?\u201d you go straight to it in the pile and bring it to me to read.</p>\n<p>On that subject, you still love books. They recommend 10 minutes a day \u2013 I think we read with you about an hour a day. You love books by Julia Donalson, the Hairy McLarey books, Old McDonald Had a Farm, Touch and Feel farm, the Hungry Caterpillar, anything by Mem Fox. Sometimes I catch you engrossed in a book on your own in the living room. And sometimes a book might even get us through one hairy car drive \u2013 well, a book, 10 songs, 3 toys and a little chat about your day.</p>\n<p>Elki, at 1, you are amazing. Your beauty, your conversations, your intelligence, and your sociability is admired by all. I am not even being biased!</p>\n<p>Love Mummy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "post_id": 457, "location": false, "date": "11-15-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>(22nd April 2011)</p>\n<p>It always surprises me how much young children know, and how aware they are.

She swings from one rope to the next, and jumps onto the tower.

Nudie Girl!&#8221; One of the boys was &#8220;nudie&#8221; too, but he was jeering, and not being jeered into a corner of the playground. The parents sat close by, sipping lattes.</div>\n<div>Why should these children care with such passion? What is it to them that a young girl doesn&#8217;t wear a top? And this is the scary part. Obviously they do care, and they care because their parents care, or someone they know cares, and even at four it&#8217;s not ok to be nudie in public.</div>\n<div>I sound like a shriveled prune when I ask &#8220;What is the world coming to??&#8221;</div>\n</div>\n", "post_id": 46, "location": false, "date": "06-04-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["limitless", "tidy", "mum", "housework", "cleaning", "messy"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/tidyroom.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-463\" title=\"http://www.touchbristol.com/business/list/bid/7224808\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/tidyroom.jpg?w=271&#038;h=250\" alt=\"\" width=\"271\" height=\"250\" /></a></p>\n<p>One of my favourite blogging topics (or not so favourite) is housework.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s come to my immediate attention that a clean house equals a clean mind and a clean mind equals a clean house.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how I got here&#8230;</p>\n<p>Perpetually labelled the &#8220;messy one&#8221; by relatives and loved ones, I have long suffered under the belief that I am not a clean or tidy person. I look at friends&#8217; houses with mixture of wonder, awe and envy &#8211; how so are they so tidy? It never ceases to amaze me how difficult it is to keep things all neat and regular. \u00a0At some point in my life, I even employed my younger brother, a starving uni student, to spend a few hours cleaning because I have some sort of a <em>fear</em>\u00a0of cleaning products.</p>\n<p>And, I realised recently, that it is just it. It&#8217;s not that I am an untidy person, because I really do value cleanliness and tidiness, it is that I have a fear of cleaning.</p>\n<p>When I first started uni in Brisbane 10 years ago, I signed up to work as a cleaner for a cleaning/babysitting/ironing agency. My first client was a very sweet lady who lived four sweaty hills away from me in a dusty old Queenslander, with three kids and a fourth on the way. Once a week, I bent on hands and knees and scrubbed and scrubbed her bathroom, her kitchen, the kids&#8217; play area. I ironed a mountain of very crumpled shirts, and spent almost an hour dusting dust that had accumulated from the nearby busy road. In the end, I quit, and left the poor expecting mother to hang out her own washing. I quit, not out of disgust for the forever dirty toilet, or for the pee that had stained the tiles, or for the mould that would not be removed from the shower. I quit out of frustration that I couldn&#8217;t remove the grime, and guilt for taking the not-very-wealthy lady&#8217;s money each week. I ended up ironing for a lady who spent most of her time in Hong Kong, but when she was home managed to accumulate a small room&#8217;s worth of ironing. She was so impressed with my speed, she paid me double, made me a sandwich and drove me home in her yellow convertible.</p>\n<p>Anyway, the anticipation of cleaning for me = fear of failure. And to be honest, fear of failure has been one of my greatest motivators <em>not </em>to do a lot of things.</p>\n<p>For example, cleaning my kitchen cupboards. I have put the job off for so long, that in the end Greg had to do it on one of his only days off in the last few months. Bad house wifey, bad. Not only am I not a working mum, but I am not a cupboard cleaning mum either.</p>\n<p>I have been battling with this guilt for the last few days. But tonight, I resolved to be kind to myself. So I don&#8217;t work, and I don&#8217;t clean cupboards. But let&#8217;s focus on the positives. I do wash up after every meal. I always straighten the living room and play room after Elka&#8217;s in bed. I always make my bed first thing in the morning. I do several loads of laundry every day. And I have as much fun with Elki in between as I possibly can. Ahhh&#8230;that feels better. It&#8217;s not all doom and gloom. And when I extricate that little pestering voice from my head that tells me I am a messy person, I look around my house, and other than my daggy furniture, I realise that I am not really that messy after all. Actually, things are pretty much in order most of the time.</p>\n<p>Order makes the mind clearer, and an ordered home reflects a clear mind. Like in that movie <em><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THE_hhk1Gzc\" target=\"_blank\">Limitless</a></em>, when the guy gets his new-found power, and all his neurons connect and his brain becomes as clear and functional as it can be, he cleans his house. His new, clear self can&#8217;t believe the\u00a0squalor\u00a0he used to live in.</p>\n<p>The more I become a mummy, the tidier my house becomes.

My rebuttal to this is that 1% is still a lot of landfill, you need about 20 reusable nappies per child, can buy them second-hand, use them for subsequent children, then on-sell them compared with the 6000 disposable nappies used per child, and Huggie&#8217;s need to try harder and create an actual biodegradable disposable nappy other than using renewable fibres &#8211; whatever that means.</p>\n<p>All my friends either use reusable or biodegradable nappies or <a href=\"http://www.natureschild.com.au/en/eco-lifestyle/454-nappy-free-dvd.html\" target=\"_blank\">none at all</a>\u00a0(I marvel at this). If ever I do have to buy a good old-fashioned Huggie&#8217;s nappy, I squirm with discomfort and guilt. &#8216;Yuk&#8217;, my gut, my soul and my heart say.</p>\n<p>Up until recently, getting our <a href=\"http://naty.com/au/Home/tabid/91/Default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Nature Baby</a>\u00a0nappies hasn&#8217;t been difficult. Then, one sad day, Coles in Alstonville forgot to restock their biodegradable nappies. It&#8217;s ok, I thought, at least I can still get them at Woolworths. This, though meant a trip to Lismore, and I am sure that drive somewhat adds something to my carbon footprint. But at least I could still get them. Then, one fine day&#8230;ba-boom. I drove all that way to Lismore, up the escalators to Lismore Square, into the very air-conditioned Woolworths, and they were out of stock! GODDAMNIT! I tried to order them, but postage is $17. Other brands are more expensive. And on these hot days, reusable nappies are very hot.</p>\n<p>So&#8230;the solution I propose is to write to all my local people of government (MPs?) and Bob Brown and Julia Gillard and anyone else in a position of power to suggest that all supermarkets should be made to stock the eco version of every product, where it exists. So maybe not as many people \u00a0buy the biodegradable nappies as they do Huggie&#8217;s because of the price, but I know many people who do.

Are we, as a race, gravitating towards being more comfortable?</p>\n<p>In my part of the world, you don&#8217;t see a lot of heels on the best of days. Maybe at Cheeky Monkey&#8217;s or the Ballina RSL, but I don&#8217;t really go to those places. In the circles I move, i.e. the beach or the markets, high heels are just plain impractical and darn uncomfortable. And although I like to spruce up a little for a wedding, most of the time I gravitate towards my Birkies.</p>\n<p>As the Mayan Calendar predicts dooms day, and so does my local ABC radio, who report the endless and completely dire political, economic and environmental forecasts, I wonder if dancing to Oka with no shoes on is all that is left to do on this planet?

What does it mean to you?</p>\n<p>To me, ritual never seemed very important. I had routine. I had a class time-table. I had church services at school. I had Schoolies. I had graduation &#8211; oops, no I missed that. And then, one day, I had a wedding.</p>\n<p>Before getting married, I didn&#8217;t think much about ritual and the seriousness of weddings. Before my own wedding, and attending weddings of close friends, I had always thought it was difficult to find the bride in the meringue. I looked, I tried, but I couldn&#8217;t work out what all the fuss was about.</p>\n<p>We didn&#8217;t have much of a lead up to our wedding. Let&#8217;s say it was about 6 months from meeting, and 3 months of an engagement. Of that time, only about 2 months were spent in each other&#8217;s physical company. Let&#8217;s just say we were taking a punt. And we knew it. We knew we were being brave warriors, flying in the face of wedding tradition by not taking 2 years to organise the big day and not planning a honeymoon. We were light-hearted about it. Until we got to writing the vows. And I realised for the first time what ritual meant.</p>\n<p>Weddings are a ritual. A serious occasion, iced with marzipan, to cement and make official the love between two people (note, I did <em>not</em> say a man and a woman).</p>\n<p>So every word of the vow we uttered was completely serious, and designed to convey the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. Because we had known each other so momentarily, our vows were very short. We didn&#8217;t promise to be with each other to death do us part. We had no idea. We could only promise to support the other to grow as they needed to grow. And everything else just had to wait and see.</p>\n<p>If I made my vows now, I would include a bit more adulation. Five years in, I have more to go on. You, my husband-to-be, are an amazing wise and kind man, who makes me complete, rested and grounded. You make me laugh every day, and no kidding, I don&#8217;t think I have had a really shit day since we got together. You share most of my passions, my feelings and my thoughts, and quietly tolerate those you don&#8217;t share. I promise to support you to be whoever you need to be, and grow however you want to grow. I promise, as much as possible, to be with you in sickness and in health and to death do us part. Thank you for loving me as myself.</p>\n<p>Anyway, ritual is important, I have come to realise.</p>\n<p>In recent days, I have introduced a little ritual into our household routine. There is ritual in our eating together and other daily activities, but this recent ritual has more of a traditional, spiritual feel. Inspired by a friend, and Elki&#8217;s love of Ommms at yoga class, we set up cushions, light an oil burner, and sit in a circle saying Oms and a blessing for the day. Elka is very fond of sending love and nourishment to all the children of the world, then clasping her hands at heart centre to say &#8220;Om&#8221;. Our ritual is an evening ritual, a time otherwise known at the Witching Hour &#8211; when dinner has been served and mum frantically tries to wash up, and prepare Elka for bed, while Elka rushes around crazily, making demands to read to her, and rolling around naked on the bed. Crazy hour is now peaceful Om hour, and all our wild energy is contained and channeled into our Oms.</p>\n<p>Tonight, we did a special ritual for my dear friend, Margot, who passed away nearly 8 years ago. Because today would have been her birthday, we planted a frangipani in the garden, then, on Elka&#8217;s insistence, set up our cushions for our Oms. Tonight, we lit our candle for Margot. I had to ask Elka to stop talking momentarily, while I said my blessings for Margot, thanking her for knowing us, and being so kind and funny and grounded and amazing.</p>\n<p>In all my wisdom and wifeliness and mumminess, I now greatly value ritual in my life.</p>\n<p><em>Blessings to Margot and all who knew her.</em></p>\n<p><em></em>xxx</p>\n", "post_id": 478, "location": false, "date": "11-28-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>(27th April 2011)</p>\n<p>Today I felt a shade of greyish blue. There are a number of reasons for this &#8211;\u00a0<em>that\u00a0</em>time of the month etc etc. But rain rain RAIN is one of them. Living on the north coast of NSW has its beauties and its benefits. We have the ocean at our heels, the sandy beaches, the colourful folk of Byron Bay, the fabulous north coast craft markets every weekend. But none of these things are much good if it&#8217;s RAINING! I sound spoilt &#8211; and I guess I am, but there are puddles everywhere, the backyard is like gravy and most importantly, days home with babies get very dull&#8230;and so, that is how we found ourselves at Playquest Lismore &#8211; the only thing to do with kids when everything else is soggy and wet.</p>\n<div>This place is pretty amazing. It&#8217;s all indoors, covered in coloured vinyl from ceiling to floor, and net so children can&#8217;t fall through gaps or down stairs etc. There are jumping castles and a pool of coloured balls. There is a cafe, and mums and dads sit around with bowls of hot chips and tomato sauce which children bounce off walls and throw balls at each other.</div>\n<div>Bringing Elka here is an interesting experience. It&#8217;s not entirely a pious decision &#8211; more a practical one, but we don&#8217;t have TV. Elka is instead content to pour through books and certain pages get her heart rate going in a way that I&#8217;m sure watching TV would quell. Seeing Elka at Playquest &#8211; stare with wide eyed fascination as children go CRAZY! makes me wonder if this is the sort of stimulation kids get places other than Playquest.</div>\n<div>By the end of an hour, Elka was exhausted, and fell asleep within moments on my lap. Maybe if we did have a TV, Elka would slowly habituate to this heightened stimulation. But maybe if this rain continues, Elka will habituate to Playquest, which I am guessing is kind of the same thing!</div>\n", "post_id": 48, "location": false, "date": "06-04-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["potty training", "nappies", "toilet training", "children"], "text": "<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/aka.media.entertainment.sky.com/image/unscaled/2011/09/09/Victoria-and-Harper-Seven-Beckham-in-New-York-0911-9.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>What is wrong with the world? Reading an old edition of New Idea this morning (ok, there&#8217;s <em>one</em>\u00a0thing that&#8217;s wrong with the world), I learnt that the press are chastising Posh Spice Beckham\u00a0for holding her four-month-old baby girl ALL THE TIME! God forbid. Really? She couldn&#8217;t possibly hold a four-month-old baby all the time, that is just <em>so </em>unnatural, especially when she commissioned a designer pram to be made to her co\u00f6rdinates. I really am shocked. What <em>is</em> Posh thinking?</p>\n<p>Of course, I am far more deeply shocked that people really give a crap if Posh holds her tiny baby instead of putting her in the pram. See, I have a theory: touch and physical contact enhance development. Children feel nurtured, and so does their skin, and their little neurons and cells fly around, thrilled to bits. Their confidence grows, they feel safer&#8230;they feel loved. I believe Elka is living\u00a0testament\u00a0to this theory of mine. Go Posh, hold your baby &#8211; I support you. It&#8217;s the best start you can give her (before priming her to take over your soon-to-be billion dollar brand).</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, in the ZanniGregElka home, things are getting organised. Without much ado, and with very little input from me, Elka has toilet-trained herself. Greg put in the initial leg work, by one day asking Elka if she would like to use the toilet. It turned out she did. And when he asked her again, she wanted to pee on the toilet again. And again and again. The next day we kept asking her, and then realised we were annoying her, because she was quite capable of telling us herself. The following day, we went shopping with no nappies. She peed in the garden before going into Vinnie&#8217;s and we got home without an accident. Every day since has been the same, and all three of us have grown in confidence.</p>\n<p>I had dreaded toilet-training, as I anticipated it would be a lot of effort. I had heard tales of woe, and I knew my lazy spirit would be tested by a need to diligently watch for pee signals. But it isn&#8217;t so. Elka simply tells me when she needs to go, and before we get in the car or go into a shop, I ask her to pee and she does. It&#8217;s been so easy. I know it isn&#8217;t so for everyone, so I apologise to those mums reading this who&#8217;s run was not so smooth.</p>\n<p>The other advantage of toilet-training has been as opening of a new communication channel. Although I consider I am generally child-focus, quite often I am absorbed in washing up or trying to get dinner on, or more often than either of those things, chatting with friends. Now, the threat of wet knickers forces me to be\u00a0more onto it, more attentive. I am down at Elka&#8217;s level asking her frequently about peeing and pooing, and when she can stand this\u00a0repetitive tirade\u00a0\u00a0of questions, I \u00a0listen and am aware of her needs.</p>\n<p>So Posh might be crazy for holding her baby, but Elka is toilet-trained. So, that&#8217;s one to us!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "post_id": 484, "location": false, "date": "12-04-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["wreath", "craft", "christmas", "decorations"], "text": "<p>Although I am not a fan of Christmas decorations decking the halls of Coles in <em>November</em>, I do love a bit of Christmas bling when the time is right.

Elka was on a 365 day waiting list, and that meant exactly that &#8211; we had no idea when we would receive the phone call to take her down to Casino hospital for a procedure. I freaked a little when I had to sign the form that approved &#8220;fillings &amp; extractions&#8221; at the dental surgeon&#8217;s discretion. Eek. So we began to look into alternatives.</p>\n<p>A dental surgeon in Alstonville had been recommended to us, so we got into see him, and he was lovely. He didn&#8217;t push us into anything, but said he could get Elka on the list for the 9th December, and it would cost about $2,000 (out of pocket). It was a big expense, but we said to ourselves that this was our daughter&#8217;s health, and a primary concern. For peace of mind, and a clear procedure date, we were prepared to pay.</p>\n<p>So, Thursday night, both Gregor &amp; I lay awake in nervous anticipation. How would Elka respond to the anaesthetic? How would she go? would she need extractions? Would she feel pain after the procedure? Fortunately, as brilliant as she is, Elka does not have the same capacity to imagine the future.</p>\n<p>I anticipated the worst bit would be the fasting prior to the anaesthetic. In the end, it wasn&#8217;t so bad. She had a good meal the night before, and in the morning I hid the fruit bowl, and didn&#8217;t eat my breakfast in front of her. I wanted to keep her occupied, so we made a Christmas tree (see my next post for more details on this!), which worked well. She happily trundled off to hospital; her only request for the morning being: &#8220;Mummy, apple? I want apple.&#8221; She has been raised well.</p>\n<p>She obligingly changed into a very sweet little surgical gown, steadfastly refused Panadol (go Elka), and graciously accepted the very ugly but generously donated knitted teddy in a bag with other goodies. Although she was starved and deprived of water, she coloured-in while we waited, chatting all the while, and raising no fuss.</p>\n<p>We went in about 10.30am for the anaesthetic. The anaesthetist had explained to me that he would sing a song to Elka while putting a gas mask on her nose and mouth, then we would lie her on the bed for her to receive the anaesthetic intravenously. I expected her to resist, but she was perfect, leaning into my chest, and allowing the gas to do its work. My eyes filled with tears as I lay my precious angel on the bed and walked away. There was such purity in her trust and acceptance. As you may know, I rarely shed a tear unless I am watching a movie, but I couldn&#8217;t control the stream as I left the room.</p>\n<p>Twenty minutes later, the dentist came out to tell me that it all went very well, and he wanted to congratulate us on Elka&#8217;s excellent teeth. The issue, he said, was not diet related, but\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.identalhub.com/article_enamel-hypoplasia-370.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">enamel hypoplasia</a>, which may have been caused by a pre or post natal fever, or another unidentified metabolic issue. He could tell because only certain teeth were defected, in a pattern that exactly mimicked the teeth&#8217;s development. It was so reassuring, because part of my crisis surrounding this tooth decay affair was the uncertainty. What on earth did we do wrong? Dentists would tell us it was because I breast fed her to sleep, or should have brushed her teeth as soon as they arrived, or she drank too much oat milk or ate too much fruit or I didn&#8217;t take fluoride when I was pregnant&#8230;the explanations were endless. It was such a relief to hear it was incidental, and there is nothing we could have done. Essentially Elka&#8217;s teeth are healthy. I was told Elka had been wheeled to recovery, and they would let me know when she awoke.</p>\n<p>I expected the worst when they told me she was awake &#8211; in an unknown hospital room with a row of sleeping old people and nurses she had never met. However, when I came in, Elka was sitting up in bed chatting and laughing with the staff. I couldn&#8217;t believe it. She was so thrilled! And so were the staff &#8211; why can&#8217;t they all be like this, they asked?</p>\n<p>After an adult sized Vegemite sandwich, a huge apple juice, a banana and a tub of yoghurt, Elka was released into the world, and labelled fighting fit and ready to go. I was so proud of my darling girl, for her bravery and acceptance of everything, and for her beautiful shining white teeth. Gregor and I were both so relieved everything went so smoothly.</p>\n<p>So&#8230;the teeth decay series is finally over. Thank you for tuning in, and for your kind thoughts and wishes throughout the whole debarcal. The good news is that I know a lot of parents who have been inspired by my story to brush their children&#8217;s teeth religiously.

In recent years, she has put a lilypilly in a pot, decorated, and then replanted it outdoors (there have been a few fatalities). Perhaps I have inherited her rebellious spirit.</p>\n<p>Last year my Christmas tree was a huge poinsettia branch &#8211; loping and curling around our living room. I collected baubles of various colours from Vinnie&#8217;s, and other bits like crystal angels, and strung them on the laconic branches. Because it was so avant garde it received a few scoff&#8217;s from more conservative family members, and was labelled &#8220;artistic&#8221; in fitting with my character.</p>\n<p>This year, more conservative family members beware, my tree is much more &#8220;artistic&#8221; than last year.<br />\n<a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/tree-detail.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright\" title=\"tree detail\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/tree-detail.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\n<p>Inspired by &#8211; I am not sure what, but perhaps lack of money, I bought five four-foot bamboo gardening stakes from Mitre 10 for $2.50 and a tin of gold paint. My vague idea was to make a tee-pee like structure and weave it with gardening twine and spray it gold.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/tree-detail.jpg\"><br />\n</a>Somehow, though, plans changed, and I ended up ripping all my scrap fabric into long strips and weaving it around my tee-pee skeleton. Gregor kindly drilled holes into a wooden plank for me to stick the ends of the tree into, which I sprayed gold. And the final touches were a red paper star on top (held on by a chopstick) and a string of flower-like lights wrapped around it. The result, I think, is majestic. I love it. Which is unusual, because I am usually so negative about my own creations. I truthfully haven&#8217;t seen anything like it before, and am very proud of my invention. The best bit is that Elka loves it too. So, a good start. I think I will go into business with these. Any orders for next year?</p>\n<p><em>Is your Christmas tree up yet?

This is a remarkable development, as anyone who knows Gregor knows how much he enjoys his cake and coffee.</p>\n<p>My interest in all things wholesome is inspired by some friends of mine, and a particular cook book by Sally Fallon, called <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Nourishing-Traditions-Challenges-Politically-Dictocrats/dp/0967089735\" target=\"_blank\">Nourishing Traditions</a>. </em>In my hunt for the perfect sourdough recipe, a friend recommended it. My copy arrived a few weeks ago. Like a sacred object, it sits on our dining room table, and I have given everyone clear instructions to wash their hands before touching it.\u00a0The recipes are simple, and largely based on a traditional agricultural diet, which include fermented food, sprouted seeds and\u00a0offal. I am yet to read the fine print, but flicking through, I am already rapt\u00a0with Fallon&#8217;s offerings.</p>\n<p>In the last couple of weeks, I have made two batches of sourdough, three jars of fermented vegetables, three jars of sprouts, and a beautiful tomato sauce from the 5kilo of tomato seconds I bought from\u00a0the farmers market on Saturday. For once, my sourdough is delicious. I love the pickles, and the sprouts make me feel very&#8230;. wholesome. And I ate liver for the first time ever &#8211; the thought of offal makes me want to vomit in my mouth, but Fallon presents a good case why we should all eat liver. Apparently there is a famous vegetarian who became\u00a0anaemic, and so added liver to his diet.

Generally, the only things we buy from the supermarket are yoghurt, bread, butter and toilet paper. Except the toilet paper, I can now make all those things. \u00a0 There is great satisfaction in trundling home from the market with baskets laden with fresh, locally grown produce, or home from the whole-food market with a big box of paper bags filled with all things healthy. There are a few \u00a0indulgences in our shopping week:</p>\n<p>1.4 kilo bucket of locally grown blueberries ($25)<br />\n500g of smoked salmon off-cuts from Northern Rivers Seafood Co-op ($10)<br />\n1/2 kilo of frozen raspberries \u00a0from a farm outside of Bangalow ($8)</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m sure we could live cheaper if we did without such decadence, but would we live as well?</p>\n<p>I feel traditionally nourished. I feel wholesome. I feel healthy and well-fed. Mostly I feel pretty full. I love food. I love shopping for it. I love preparing it. And luckily, now that Gregor doesn&#8217;t eat sweet things, I don&#8217;t have to diminish my skills in the kitchen by trying to bake a cake.</p>\n<p>The only problem is, if we eat this healthily, is my daughter going to be 6ft6in? She is on her way to being exceptionally tall already &#8211; maybe this super diet is going to tip her over the edge.</p>\n<p><em>What are your weekly shopping habits like?</em></p>\n", "post_id": 506, "location": false, "date": "12-13-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Happy New Year"], "text": "<p>Christmas descended, and left in its wake a pile of wrapping paper and a once-in-a-year hangover.

We drank champagne for breakfast, ate croissants, and then ate ourselves sillier by the river in Evans Head. I have to say, it was all very blissful. We did not even encounter a &#8220;humdinger&#8221;, which in my family&#8217;s vocabulary is a very typical occurrence, usually stimulated by alcohol, and always resulting with tears. The bliss may have been due to the most recent member of the family, young Elka, who stood next to the pudding, serenading us all with &#8220;Twinkle Twinkle&#8221; &#8220;Baa Baa Black Sheep&#8221; and &#8220;Incy Wincy&#8221;.

Fortunately for us, a lot of the time both of us have been\u00a0at home most of the week, because Gregor&#8217;s work as a massage therapist has paid well, and he has only needed to work a few days. The rest, we made up with government assistance.\u00a0However, in the economic crisis, Greg&#8217;s work has become less predictable.</p>\n<p>We have teetered near the brink of extinction, but apart from the occasional indulgence in a large bucket of blueberries and a daily coffee &amp; teeni-cino at a caf\u00e9, as a little family, we are good at being economical and resourceful. I generally make presents for people instead of buying them, we cook all our food from scratch and never eat out. We buy from the market and the whole food shop which does make a big difference. I don&#8217;t clothes shop, unless you count Vinnie&#8217;s, and we rely heavily on the generosity of family&#8230;Sometimes, poring through a Country Style magazine I wish we had a bit of money to spend. But most of the time, we value the time we have together more than material things.</p>\n<p>Recently, Greg began work in disability care, which has sustained us, but has meant Greg usually works seven days a week. Exhausted, and still stressed about paying the mortgage, we knew things would have to change. I promised to look for some work, and knew that between us, we could do it. The majority of families in Australia do have two incomes; it is a wonder we have gone so well for so long.</p>\n<p>So&#8230;the glory days are over. I have a job. The first place I approached has taken me in as a barista for Saturday mornings. I haven&#8217;t made coffee for years, and after working as a manager at the art gallery in Melbourne, I didn&#8217;t think I would go back to it. But fortunately, coffee-making is flexible, local and available. So in other words, it&#8217;s perfect for me.</p>\n<p>OK, I guess working three hours a week doesn&#8217;t really classify me as a working mum. But it was fantastic submerging myself in the little world of a caf\u00e9 once again. It feels like the epicentre behind the coffee machine &#8211; you see all the characters come and go, you hear the conversations between staff and pick up on organisational politics. Hopefully I will get more work, so Greg can work a bit less.

The sun shone gaily, the sea was crystal clear, and there was a special market along the broadwalk beside the beach. My brother Dylan was playing his second gig in Rockin&#8217; Seeds, who were supporting the splendid market atmosphere. I bumped into friends and other family members, Elka rocked out, and ran around in her nappy in the sunshine, and my parents bought me coffee. It was great. Saturday night, we spent drinking and getting happy with my parents, which was one of the best nights I have spent with Mum and Dad since I moved back to the area. Then Sunday, we went out to a friend&#8217;s house in the hinterland for a picnic. Children ran around amongst the chickens, the food was divine, and a koala sat in a nearby gum, placidly munching on leaves.</div>\n<div>Fortunately for me, Easter wasn&#8217;t a long weekend from an arduous job.

I was sitting next to the pool at the Natural Birth Centre in Lindendale, eating beautiful food with my midwife and birth support when at last, after two tedious weeks of acupuncture-herb-hot-curry-hot-sex concoctions, my uterus began to contract. I was preparing for a gentle build-up, to go and have a lie down in between contractions, perhaps a little bath. My body, however, took me by surprise and hurled me into the pit of fire, before I had the chance to think, or even run a bath.</p>\n<p>I had decided not to take any pain relief. Between a consultation with\u00a0Rhea Dempsey at <a href=\"http://www.fertileground.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Fertile Ground</a>\u00a0and reading <a href=\"http://www.activebirthcentre.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Janet Balaskas&#8217;s</a> Active Birth, I was convinced a natural, drug-free birth was the right thing for me. I had prepared by doing lots of yoga, leg strengthening exercise and meditation. I felt ready to take on whatever labour held for me. And I did. I kid you not, I was an Amazonian Goddess.</p>\n<p>The moon was full, it was blue, it was New Years Eve so fireworks burst as I went through transition. With every pinch and then avalanche of pain, I went inwards, and found my strength. I breathed. I acknowledged. I embraced. The second I resisted, or weakened into it, thinking &#8220;Shit, this is the most painful thing in the world&#8230;get me out!&#8221;, the pain became pain, and the experience went from strong and profound to terrifying. In the relative short time of my labour, I worked out that the more I went with it, and found my zone, the more bearable, and&#8230;amazing labour was.</p>\n<p>At 3.13am on Friday 1st January 2010, my little cherub was born. She weighed 4.2kg, and emerged red and screaming. Two years ago today.</p>\n<p>We are celebrating Elka&#8217;s birthday and life in general by spending two days at <a href=\"http://www.woodfordfolkfestival.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Woodford Folk Festival</a> and a few nights going feral in the hinterlands of the Sunshine Coast. Today, as a very special occasion, for all of us, we ate cake at a cafe in Montville, a soulless\u00a0but superficially gorgeous village. I alluded in <a href=\"http://heartmama.net/2011/12/28/good-tidings-we-bring/\" target=\"_blank\">my last post</a> to the frantic, disorganised nature of our camping trip. But really, ferrying around this evening at 6pm on my daughter&#8217;s one and only second birthday looking for a campsite was beyond disorganised. Most people probably would have prepared for the fact that today is New Years&#8217; Day and campsites by the coast are in all likelihood going to be full. Perhaps do<em> not</em> try to find something at 6pm. Luckily for us, the campsite at Yarinda is not overly popular, even on New Years&#8217;, so we were able to pitch a tent, feed and bathe Elka and get her into bed before she collapsed with exhaustion.</p>\n<p>Running after Miss Nudey Bum on the beach today, I was overcome by her blissful and uninhibited beauty; her love of life and of people (and of sand); her tireless need for kisses; and her current obsession for asking &#8220;Mumma, where has [insert name here] gone?&#8221;&#8230;How can she be so amazing, and so full of love? At two, my darling is perfect, and I wouldn&#8217;t change a scrap. I hope your 2012 will be full of love and laughter and good things, and Elka&#8217;s third year on the planet will be full of something similar.

January, for me, isn&#8217;t so dizzy, as exhausting. My post-Christmas and New Year hangover is still sorting itself out, and I am catching up on sleep from our very social holiday. I hope Elka will be doing the same. I smell Heat Wave, and that usually equates with exhaustion. Yep, January for me equals tired and hot.</p>\n<p>But, there is a reprieve. A whimper of hope. As the New Year dawned, and I kissed my husband on the dance floor, and raised a glass to my daughter&#8217;s birth day, I made a silent New Years&#8217; resolution. This year I will be kinder. This year I will be more relaxed.</p>\n<p>On the Eve of the Festive Season, I was overwhelmed with hormones, and paint fumes. And any time I have to much to do, I turn into Miss Cranky Pants. It&#8217;s not major &#8211; screaming, kicking tantrums etc&#8230;I grew out of that when I was a teenager. I get irritable. Post meeting Gregor and pre having a baby, my irritable self was dormant. I was relaxed. Life was easy. I was Miss Kind and Happy. Having a baby equals responsibility, and for me that means stress. The stress is not pervasive, but it&#8217;s there. My daughter needs to eat and drink and sleep and do poos. I need to make sure all these things happen. I get on my bossy horse and canter around the house, yelling instructions to my poor sweet husband, who cowers in my wake. And if godforbid he says the wrong thing at the wrong time of month when I am high on paint fumes, there is a wild and cranky blizzard and all husbands in my path be ware.</p>\n<p>Anger is a \u00a0justifiable emotion. I think, evolutionarily speaking, it is \u00a0useful too. It protects us. It makes us act. It makes us strong. Rather than crying in the corner, we can yell\u00a0obscenities, and all will be well. Although&#8230;I think there is something more damaging about anger. Because it is so easy to justify, it is so easy to hold onto the reins with a tight grip, even though we feel like absolute shit, and secretly we know we are wrong. Anger bogs us down. And stops us from doing things. And after King Cranky Storm, I don&#8217;t feel calm. I feel bedraggled, soiled and despondent. I feel like shit. In the past, post Cranky Storm was a catalyst for depression. Now, I just feel down. Empty. Exhausted.</p>\n<p>From the outside, my life isn&#8217;t stressful. I work 4 hours a week, I have one very obliging child, I study but for me that means listening to lectures once a week, and occasionally doing an essay. The most stressful moments of my week are trying to get out the door with all the things I need for Elka for the day in time to meet someone at a market or for lunch. I stress when Elka hasn&#8217;t drunk enough water, or when we get back too late for her to have a nice dinner before bed. Considering I used to work in a very busy and demanding environment, and coped \u00a0well with the stress of it all, it doesn&#8217;t make sense that I get stressed, which for me then boils into irritation.</p>\n<p>As I wash out the camping gear, and re-organise the house, I realise that All Is Good. Time to chill, read a book, be nice to my husband&#8230;2012, may you see the new me and be proud.</p>\n<p><em>What have you resolved for the new year?</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/signature.jpg?w=240&amp;h=31\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n", "post_id": 530, "location": false, "date": "01-05-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<div id=\"attachment_539\" style=\"width: 614px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://heartmama.net/2012/01/05/elka-at-yayoi-kusama-exhibition-goma-qld/\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-539\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/kusama2.jpg?w=604&#038;h=453\" alt=\"\" width=\"604\" height=\"453\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Elka at Yayoi Kusama exhibition, GOMA, QLD</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_548\" style=\"width: 614px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/kusama-annie.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-548\" title=\"Kusama Annie\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/kusama-annie.jpg?w=604&#038;h=453\" alt=\"\" width=\"604\" height=\"453\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Granny Annie at Kusama exhibition</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_546\" style=\"width: 614px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/kusama1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-546\" title=\"Gregor &amp; Elka at Kusama exhibition\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/kusama1.jpg?w=604&#038;h=453\" alt=\"\" width=\"604\" height=\"453\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Father &amp; daughter</p></div>\n", "post_id": 544, "location": false, "date": "01-05-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<h3></h3>\n<div id=\"post-body-6004536207721681541\">(29th April, 2011)</div>\n<div>So, like<img class=\"alignleft\" style=\"border-color:initial;border-style:initial;border-width:0;\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/230238_10150551792880062_797220061_17868002_487739_n.jpg?w=250&#038;h=320\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"320\" border=\"0\" />\u00a0the other 2 billion or so people around the world, I sat glued to the TV watching the Royal Wedding.

And if I had tried to watch it on our computer, Greg would have booted me off for sure after 30min of frivolity so he can watch the tennis (his argument is he is not a monarchist, but it&#8217;s probably more that he is just a guy).</div>\n<div id=\"post-body-6004536207721681541\">\n<div>Oh, and what a wedding it was. The dress was splendid, Kate looked gorgeous, Will&#8217;s blush was touching&#8230;Julia Gillard looked lovely in Oyster and Navy, and some of those hats were&#8230;questionable. But it got me thinking &#8211; why? And what is all this pomp and fanfare for?</div>\n<div>Memories of my own wedding came flooding back. We had a great time, four years ago, on a little country hill on a stormy afternoon. I had little to do with the planning &#8211; Mum did the most part.</div>\n<div>Everything that was organised worked out so well &#8211; the band, the catering, the venue. Years later, people still say it is one of the best weddings they have been to. Unlike Will and Kate&#8217;s, it was largely to do with the relaxed vibe, and the fact that everyone came, drank and danced, and that was that.</div>\n<div>Friends have been married since, and every time I attend a wedding, I am struck with the same tear-jerking, heart-squishing sentiments. These people love each other, and are planning to stick together forever, through it all, even the arduous wedding preparations. And a secret part of me always feels a bit sad or jealous or something&#8230;now this person is married, and I won&#8217;t be as much part of their life. Strangely, I even felt this last night &#8211; here was the man I had dreamt about marrying when I was eight or nine&#8230;Convinced, in fact, that he and I would fall in love one day &#8211; that striking, and sensitive Prince called Will. And there he was with another girl, committed and tied to this girl I didn&#8217;t know forever&#8230;</div>\n<div>That&#8217;s the irony of marriage, I suppose. Is it forever? As we know, so many couples break up. Out of the Royal Windsors, Queenie&#8217;s still married, and so is Edward, but the rest are either onto their second marriage or separated. So these vows that we so piously make, with hands on hearts&#8230;do we really mean them? Or are we just saying?</div>\n<div>Greg and I dealt with this one swiftly when we married. We had been together for a matter of weeks when Greg first proposed. We spent three months living together before we were married, and hence, were tentative when making the big commitment. We wanted it to work, desperately, and we were going to try. But in the eyes of the Good Lord (who wasn&#8217;t invited to our wedding, but I am sure was there somewhere), we promised to support each other to grow. And that was the only promise we made. Four years later, we are still supporting each other. We barely fight, we accept each other&#8217;s differences, and we love each other tirelessly. But who knows where the future will take us?</div>\n<div>I wasn&#8217;t alive when Diana and Charles married, but the images are firmly planted in my mind. Images of the Royal Kiss, Diana stepping out of her carriage. All the vows, the pomp and the fanfare that day, the promises and of course everyone&#8217;s expectation that this couple would represent for us everything we hope love and commitment will be. Of course, we were sorely disappointed. Nothing is as it seems.</div>\n<div>But I wish Will and Kate all the best&#8230;as a modern couple, they have it a bit easier perhaps than Di and Charles did&#8230;they are more mature for one, and have a history together, and obviously a great love.

A successful father, a private school, a top Australian university and a family of high achievers leads me to feel that at some point in my life I will do something worthwhile. And so I continue to study, because in \u00a0the story I tell myself, this is the safest way to achieve success. In the background to my study are a million ingenious ideas that will one day make me famous, and each of these I dance around and dream about.</p>\n<p>I listen to friends who have started businesses, or successful blogs, or have achieved something fantastic in their professional lives. A part of me is happy for them, but another part of me turns against myself, and points an accusing finger at all my failings, and my own lack of success. Why haven&#8217;t I started a business yet? Or become a doctor? Or published a novel? Why do I continually fall short?</p>\n<p>In a typically philosophical conversation with my husband last night, we talked about dreams. The previous night a beautiful young man had said to Gregor that he believed we should all follow our dreams. In a typically cynical fashion, Gregor had suggested that this sentiment was for the privileged. People who have nothing to eat, he argued, just want something to eat. They aren&#8217;t likely to live the dream life of becoming an artist&#8230;or whatever the dream may be. And so unfurled a discussion about the nature of dreaming and following one&#8217;s dream. Even if, in our privileged society, we feel the need to live out our dreams&#8230;will it make us happy? Is this what life is really about?</p>\n<p>I wonder&#8230;as I tip water from one container to another with Elka, the sun is setting and it is beginning to cool. I am thinking about my blog post, and about how to become a successful person, and she is asking me to come back to the moment: &#8220;Mumma, pour water. Mumma?&#8221; In these precious years, when I have the time and the space to <em>really</em> be with my child, why am I still so anxious to achieve something else? Why am I jealous when I hear of another person&#8217;s success? Why do constantly feel like a failure?</p>\n<p>Gregor&#8217;s dream in his twenties was to become a rock star. He played two hours a day, wrote hundreds of songs, played in bands&#8230;he lived and breathed music. He was meanwhile living his dream of becoming enlightened at a Buddhist retreat centre in England. At some point, the two dreams collided, and his soon to be enlightened self told his ordinary human self that his dream to be a rock star was not bringing him happiness, only dissatisfaction. When at last he let go of that tightly-clung dream, he was released. And now can live happily ever after.</p>\n<p>I think of Gregor&#8217;s release, and my own pithy dreams. Does my urge to &#8220;succeed&#8221; detract from the present with my child? I am starting to realise that I need a new definition of success. Success is my life as it is. Happy. Golden. Present. Full Of Love. I&#8217;ve repeatedly said I wouldn&#8217;t change a thing. But maybe the one thing I would change is to let go of my desire to be a better, different, wealthier, more &#8220;successful&#8221; person&#8230;</p>\n<p><em>How do you feel about dreaming?

My heart bashed against my rib cage. Even the most experienced Life Line telephone counsellor will tell you that every call is an unknown, and the anticipation before each call is almost the hardest part. Who is calling? Will I be able to help?</p>\n<p>Two minutes into the conversation, however, my heart rate slowed. I sat back in my chair, and at once, all my training, the notes I had taken, the fears I had had subsided, and I glided through the call. I was at one with the caller &#8211; hanging on every word, and knowing when to interject, focus the call, and politely point out contradictions the caller was not seeing.</p>\n<p>After 26 minutes, I sat back, and breathed deeply. My first call had been answered. The caller had left with a thank you, and praise, and I felt content. As I suspected, I realised I love counselling.</p>\n<p>The following three calls were &#8220;Unwelcome calls&#8221; &#8211; abusive, unwanted. I had been most afraid of these calls, and yet my body didn&#8217;t respond as I thought it would&#8230;I remained calm. Two significant hurdles crossed.</p>\n<p>The rest of the calls were from people living alone, possibly with a mental illness, just needing to connect with humanity. These too are crisis calls.</p>\n<p>Forever an &#8220;Agony Aunt&#8221;, as my dad would say, I have always loved to listen to people, and be with them and their concerns. People interest me. As a kid, I would be caught out for staring at older children, watching their interactions. I was 6, I think, when a 12-year-old came towards me in the bus queue and threatened to bash my head in because I was staring. It wasn&#8217;t malicious&#8230;I was genuinely interested in her, and all her subtleties. And my favourite thing in the world is sitting down with a friend, hearing her out. My door is always open, and my kettle freshly boiled.</p>\n<p>As I plug my way through a long and arduous psychology degree, tonight I remember\u00a0why. I think of people like our dear friend Heidi who so tragically ended her life last year, and I realise how important it is that there are people who will answer a phone to someone who is needing help.</p>\n<p>Today feels like I reached a milestone.</p>\n", "post_id": 590, "location": false, "date": "01-11-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>(2nd May, 2011)</p>\n<p>In our household, &#8220;Nah&#8221; is a very popular word. In fact, &#8220;Nah&#8221; has recently become a very well-pronounced &#8220;No&#8221;, and yes, the culprit is Elka.</p>\n<div>Every question that begins with &#8220;Would you like&#8230;&#8221; is answered by &#8220;Nah&#8221;. &#8220;Nah&#8221; is the word used when pushing food away or a loving hand or a loving kiss. &#8220;Nah&#8221; is used when running in the opposite direction to the direction desired by the parent in question. It is incredibly adorable, if not just a little bit frustrating.</div>\n<div>My partner and I started talking about this word, &#8220;No&#8221;, and if it was something we should encourage (though we must suppress a giggle every time it is uttered with such vehemence). Friends we know try and encourage words like &#8220;Yes&#8221; and other such words with positive associations. And I can see the logic in that&#8230;a &#8220;Yes&#8221; family, who, when offered food or a cuddle embrace it with a warm and loving &#8220;Yessss&#8221; sounds very nice.</div>\n<div>But then we thought &#8220;No&#8221; has it&#8217;s advantages too. For one, Elka, in denying the offer, is also asserting herself, and I am sure no-one who knows her would deny she is an assertive, if not fiery, young lady. And as she gets older, she will be encouraged to say &#8220;No&#8221; to strangers in cars offering lollies, or drunken men in bars when she is older still. &#8220;No&#8221; in fact, has many advantages for a lady.</div>\n<div>I am not sure if it&#8217;s a myth or not (I suppose I could just use Google to clarify, but there you go&#8230;) In Thai, there is no word for &#8220;No&#8221; for women&#8230;Women and men have a different form of language apparently. I think this is interesting (if it&#8217;s true) as it seems to put women in a bit of a powerless, submissive position, if they can never say &#8220;No&#8221;. Of course, saying &#8220;Yes&#8221; instead probably has a lot of positive impact on one&#8217;s psychology, but I am sure there are many occasions when a woman would like to say &#8220;No&#8221;. So&#8230;we thought we would let that one fly.</div>\n<div>And besides, it is pretty adorable when it is said with great gusto by a pint sized person!</div>\n", "post_id": 60, "location": false, "date": "06-04-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>(3rd May, 2011)</p>\n<p>We went to Vinnie&#8217;s today in Lismore to buy Greg shorts. This is our small contribution to the world &#8211; we prefer the musky smell of Vinnie&#8217;s to the sweat shop smell that emanates from the River&#8217;s discount store below Woolworth&#8217;s. Although most things in Vinnie&#8217;s were most likely made in a sweat shop at some point, at least we can claim smugly that we buy &#8216;Recycled&#8217;. Anyway, I diverge &#8211; that&#8217;s not really the point of my story&#8230;</p>\n<div>What happened in Vinnie&#8217;s is&#8230;a lady comes in with two children in a pram. No biggie. Except that one of the girls was crying. No, make that scccrrrrcreeeeaaaaming. Screaming in desperation. The sort of scream where everyone exchanges glances in embarrassment for the poor mother. I felt sorry for the mum at first. I can imagine her thoughts, thoughts of shame perhaps, and longing for her child to be calm, and embarrassed looks to cease. The crying continued. The girl was two &#8211; I know this because in the midst of the chaos, the mother yelled out, &#8220;Anyone want to take home a two year old?&#8221; That&#8217;s when I started to feel less sorry for the mother, and more sorry for the child. And the mother&#8217;s look was smug&#8230;It seemed this episode of screaming was not uncommon. The mother&#8217;s expression was a mask of resilience. Perhaps she needed to appear in control and maintain humour in this awkward moment, and was practised at doing so.</div>\n<div>I no longer felt sorry for the poor mother. I only longed for her to take the child out of the pram, and give her a hug. Or ask her what the matter is. Or anything that could be interpreted as affectionate. The child must have had a reason for screaming so ferociously, and even if it is frequent, then even more reason to give her a cuddle.</div>\n<div>Of course this is just my interpretation of the situation. I have no idea what was going on before hand, or anything about this woman or her child, or her relationship with her child. Who am I to judge? All I can do is put myself in her shoes, and if I was in her shoes, I am sure I would have done things differently. You see, my<em>personal</em>\u00a0feeling is that children cry or scream for a reason. They are actually saying something, and no matter how irrational it seems to us, we need to listen. If we constantly ignore our children&#8217;s cries, then the child learns that when she cries, no one listens. She learns that the world doesn&#8217;t listen, and her feelings aren&#8217;t acknowledged. She learns, perhaps, that she is not worthy of being heard.</div>\n<div>So in that musky Vinnie&#8217;s haze, I am sure I would have been a different mother. But then again, maybe not &#8211; maybe if my history with my daughter had been similar to that mother and daughter&#8217;s history, maybe I would have done as she had. Maybe I should reserve my judgement for another day, and put my own smug look away.</div>\n", "post_id": 63, "location": false, "date": "06-04-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>(4th May, 2011)</p>\n<p>Why can&#8217;t I be as tidy as my temporary Spanish house guest, Juliana?

A storm idled in the distance, threatening to close the wedding down, but reaching only blowing point before drifting away. People gathered in cocktail attire, some ecstatic for the happy couple, most of them sure this whole thing was a good idea, and a few very uncertain it was.</p>\n<p>Bubbles were blown as the champagne cork flew. In the photos, we all look happy, as every wedding party should. But it was true, I hadn&#8217;t known the fella long, and as I clasped that little bag of rings, I knew I was taking a dive in the deep end.</p>\n<p>Gregor and I met under a giant\u00a0chandelier\u00a0at the Sydney Biennale 2006. He was tall, I was tall. Apparently he was taken by the apple skirt I was wearing at the time. We exchanged pleasantries, and he offered to help us with our project upstairs. His lopsided smile and twinkly eyes suggested life was fun, simple, and may as well be enjoyed. I gladly accepted the invitation.</p>\n<p>A couple of days later, aware that I would be spending the evening in a strange city alone, he extended a particularly long arm, and invited me to dinner with him and a friend. We wandered into the city, and I learnt of his strange past of living in squats as a punk in The Netherlands, then moving to England to become a vegan and a Buddhist. He bought me the largest steak I have ever seen, and his was larger.</p>\n<p>In the midst of the craziness of the Biennale, I was constantly drawn to his constancy. His stability. His ability to keep a twinkle in his eye and a joke on his lips. I gave him my phone number and told him to visit me in Melbourne. And he did.</p>\n<p>One night after a party, you could say we became a couple.</p>\n<p>We spent the next few weeks getting to know one another, although much of that time he spent on the road camping and touring Victoria. During our time together, we found we had so much in common, and conversation was endless. As we said goodbye at the airport, there were still 1000 things to be said. We hugged for a long time, and hoped it would be possible to meet again. He called me from the stop-over airport, and I knew at that point that we would make a commitment to be together, no matter what it took.</p>\n<p>He spent three months back in Europe. We discussed every option possible for his return. I had just started a new and important job, and having lived in Europe the previous year, did not want to go back. He wanted to come to Australia &#8211; the land of enthusiastic people and kangaroo sausages. He painted a portrait of me to while away the months. All options considered, we settled on a temporary spousal visa, which of course involves marriage. I had discussed this with everyone I knew. A number of eye brows were raised. But really, it made sense. Although I had physically been with this person for such little time, we really loved one another. I really could see myself being with him indefinitely. We were a fit. And for the first time in my life, I knew what a fit felt like.</p>\n<p>Initially we were planning the registry office, then decided to go the full haul&#8230;the white wedding, with champagne, rose petals and a four piece band. Why not? It was our wedding after all, and from all perspectives, our one and only.</p>\n<p>Planning a wedding with my strange and jubilant European was easy. We would keep it relaxed. And we both understood that we were entering a contract under precarious circumstances. If, for whatever reason, it didn&#8217;t work out, we would be ok. Our expectations were realistic. It could go pear-shaped. But any marriage could go pear-shaped, and nearly half the time they do. Planning a wedding was also also made easier by the fact that mum, despite her reservations, did just about everything on the ground, from organising the venue, the flowers, the food and the wine.</p>\n<p>The week before our wedding, we wrote our vows. Having been a practising Buddhist for a number of years, Gregor opted for a vow of truth. We would not commit until death do us part, or in sickness and in health. We didn&#8217;t know each other fully. We would promise to support one another to grow in any way we needed to grow. And that was all we could promise, in the garden of a village church.</p>\n<p>Five years later, people still tell me it was the best wedding they have ever been to. A combination of the relaxed vibe, the amazing band who played all night, the lack of sit down dinner, and the dancing. One girl said to me that our wedding was her favourite because of its\u00a0genuineness. \u00a0We treated the wedding as a union between two people, who in this particular moment, loved each other and wanted to be together and really, a wedding was the only way that was possible.</p>\n<p>Every year after that wedding on a hill, I love my husband even more. We fit together better than ever. We love each other continuously. We have the occasional rogue argument, but we always know it will pass within minutes. Since having a child with him, I have been ever more certain that he is perfect for me. He is the perfect father &#8211; loving, kind and\u00a0unflappable. He only wants the best for my child and for me. We still support each other to grow as each need to grow, but now, so much more than that.</p>\n<p>Five years later, on Friday the 13th of January, he is still my best friend and soul&#8217;s companion.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/wedding3.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-750\" title=\"wedding\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/wedding3.jpg?w=614&#038;h=461\" alt=\"\" width=\"614\" height=\"461\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "post_id": 661, "location": false, "date": "01-12-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["co-sleep", "sleep", "family bed"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/bed.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-669\" title=\"bed\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/bed.jpg?w=604&#038;h=453\" alt=\"\" width=\"604\" height=\"453\" /></a></p>\n<p>My favourite time of day is the moment I go to bed, and a small warm-bodied child rolls from her end of the bed into me, snuggling her head into my chest. One small warm hand delicately cups my cheek. She is still asleep &#8211; her closeness and intimacy is instinctual. She senses her mother and wants to be near.</p>\n<p>The family bed is controversial. When people ask where Elka sleeps, they are often dismayed to learn that she sleeps in our bed. People give me gifts for her room and quilts for her bed, perhaps in the hope she will move there. And yet when young children visit our home, they bee-line to our family bed, which is a king-sized mattress plus a king-single mattress on the floor, butted against the wall. The children will lie in it, or bounce on it, or roll around. Elka does the same thing. Occasionally, if I am making dinner, I wonder where Elka is. She is lying in our bed.</p>\n<p>There was no debate in our family that our child would sleep in our bed. Our feeling was that freshly out of the womb, a child needs to be close to its mother, particularly at night. Gone are the days when the nurses would remove a new-born baby for up to 10 days, bring it to the mother for feeds, so the mother could rest up after labour. Now Elka is Miss Independent, but we all still love to sleep next to one another, and wake up together.</p>\n<p>At first Elka slept directly next to me, and Gregor in another bed, so he could sleep through the night before work. We then used an insert, so her tiny body was on a different surface, with little foam bits either side to protect her. For a while she was in a cradle directly next to my side of the bed. And when she was too big for the cradle, she came back in to our bed. Initially, our concern was that we might roll on\u00a0her in our sleep, or a blanket might cover her face. But we very soon found that although we were asleep, we were very aware of where she was in the bed. We placed her on top of the covers, and down from the pillows, just to be sure.</p>\n<p>Night feeding was easy for me. Elka would wake and I would have already woken, because our cycles were in sync. I would feed very briefly and both of us would drift back to sleep. During the early morning, we would be in a half sleep as she fed. I always think this is one of the reasons why I have not felt tired since having a baby.</p>\n<p>Co-sleeping is often given a bad rap in the media. It causes SIDS, people say&#8230;children die from being suffocated. I believe that if you practice co-sleeping correctly, it is very safe. Some believe safer than having babe in a cot or a crib. <a href=\"http://www.cosleeping.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Dr James McKenna</a>\u00a0has conducted much research into co-sleeping, and has found that co-sleeping promotes bonding and breastfeeding. He found that babies are attuned to the mothers&#8217; \u00a0body temperature, and are able to adjust theirs accordingly. Mothers and babies in general were more attuned with each other. Longitudinal studies have found that children who co-slept with the parents were generally secure adults, and had positive intimate relationships. It is advised that parents don&#8217;t co-sleep if drunk or on drugs, as this can be dangerous.\u00a0Of course, everyone should do what that are most comfortable with. We have been most comfortable with co-sleeping, and now I can&#8217;t imagine it any other way.</p>\n<p>Being intimate with my husband is not a problem, either. We spend every evening together, after Elka&#8217;s gone to bed. We have many opportunities just to be with the two of us.

Facial cleanse.<br />\nI&#8217;m cleaning no pantry, and unfortunately a facial is out of my budget&#8230;but there was a cleanse I was meaning to get around to all of 2011&#8230;my wardrobe.</p>\n<p>After almost two years of frivolous op-shopping and occasionally failing to try garments on, I realised that half my wardrobe didn&#8217;t fit me. The other half I have had since I was twelve, so no, didn&#8217;t fit either. Part of the problem with my wardrobe was lack of space, and the other was with the pile of clothes that was starting to crumble. I also desperately wanted to find a clothes pattern I thought might be tucked somewhere behind the jungle&#8230;there, incentive enough.</p>\n<p>So Play School on attending to my child, I began to Strip the Willow. One pile came crashing down at a time. Dress after dress was strewn on the bed. Eventually the bed was buried, and I deliberately stopped myself from faltering before the crucial culling then re-folding stages.</p>\n<p>One episode of Play School and two garbage bags later, I was cleansed.</p>\n<p>Although you might not guess it from surveying the clutter of my tiny house, I am not a hoarder. I know when to throw away. For a garment to remain, three basic rules applied:<br />\n1. It had to fit around the boobs<br />\n2. It had to be unblemished or not torn<br />\n3. It had to be made of silk&#8230;actually that was more a desired requirement than a rule.</p>\n<p>The best thing about cleansed cupboards and neatly folded clothes, is the amount of <em>space</em>. And so, a day later, I indulged in a trip to not one but two oppies, and came out smiling and laden with clothes that fit around the boobs, are unblemished and not torn, and even one dress was made from silk.</p>\n<p>No, I will not be cleansing the pantry cupboard anytime soon, and no, I did not find the pattern.</p>\n<p>Have you cleansed this fine 2012?

I bemoaned the fact for the proceeding 364 days, and then yesterday, all wrongs were righted (?) and I had a beautiful day, beginning with a thoughtful gift, including a massage voucher, and heading out to the market to buy whatever I set my heart on.

At one end, is Greg &#8211; the diligent, and careful person, who checks the oven every times he leaves the house to make sure it wasn&#8217;t left on. At the other end is me &#8211; I never check the oven, and I watch from a distance as Elka does her thing. I let her wander round the garden, explore the front verandah. I never think for a second that something bad is going to happen to her. And so far, she hasn&#8217;t strayed very far, or gotten into trouble&#8230;much.</div>\n<div>There was one instance that Greg frequently likes to remind me of&#8230;Greg wasn&#8217;t there, but my parents and I looked on dotingly one afternoon, as Elka played in the garden at my parents&#8217; house. Then&#8230;my god, she was rolling down the hill! A big very steep hill that is their front garden! Thankfully, it has all recently been landscaped, and a little friendly bush caught my darling girl in its leafy hands. She got the fright of her life &#8211; and so did I of course!

Infants who had been given a lot of safety direction tended to go out onto the glass ledge without much thought, whereas infants who were left to explore their own boundaries were far more cautious and tended to stay on the table proper.

Since 9pm Thursday, she has been chucking regularly. It\u2019s awful seeing her so helpless against this nasty bug. Thankfully, aside from the chucking, she seems quite happy\u2026and in some ways it has been very nice for me. We have been shadowing each other all night and all day. And there is a side of my personality that is enriched at times like these.</p>\n<p>If you ask Greg, he will tell you I\u2019m not the most sympathetic person when he is ill. If he complains of feeling sick, my first response is \u201cOh no, here we go again. Get up, you\u2019ll be right.\u201d The Aussie battler attitude is firmly engrained in me. As are the attitudes of my own family, particularly my Dr Dad\u2019s, who responded to our illnesses as children only when we were on death\u2019s door.</p>\n<p>But this last twenty-four hours, I have followed Elka like a hawk (with a bucket in my talons to catch the spew) and my every cell is one of concern and tenderness.

So although I feel awful for her having this yucky illness, I feel a little bit proud of myself, that somewhere deep inside lives a nurturing woman, who might have been a nurse in another life time.</p>\n<p>And days like this, I have no desire to sneak a look at Facebook on my phone while I am playing with Elka. Or hurry out of the house with her to have some social contact with a friend and their child, for god forbid I get bored at home and run out of games. No. Instead I am the archetypal mother, and engage in every precious moment with my baby like it\u2019s the last.

There is this dreadful gastro-flu virus circulating, and it appears to have attached itself to every slippery-dip, every shopping trolley and every other surface in the village.</p>\n<div>And it was COLD! Now, I know it sounds strange &#8211; we live in Northern NSW, home of sunshine and warmth, where you can swim in the sea in July. But seriously, it was very cold. Maybe as low as 15degrees celcius.

It&#8217;s a tile and brick town house in Pleasantville Boulevard, where every lawn is manicured, and every hedge it pruned, but you never see a sole. But Joyce (my Grandma) always took great pleasure in the fact that her trees grew like a rainforest in front, her lawn was roughly mown, and no plant was ever pruned. Where her house could be different, and still keep within council regulations, it was. And in my memory from childhood, the best feature was the pot belly stove in the middle of the living room.</div>\n<div>The architecture of the house is designed around the pot belly. There is a very strange brick wall smack bang in the middle of the house, that separates the kitchen from the living room. Its purpose is to be a platform for the little stove. The rest of the living room circulates around. It is an odd design. But made even more odd by the fact that in recent years, Joyce swore the pot belly was broken. Sorry, Joyce, but it actually works fine. We tested it this Sunday, and have spent every evening since curled up beside its warmth.

Time passes, people move town. In the beginning, we sat around eating ice-cream and watching SITC, gossiping about boys. Later, we became mothers, successful lawyers, architects, CEOs, poets, and academics. Yet, we can still sit under the harsh sun of Melbourne&#8217;s summer and feel as comfortable together as that first month we met.</p>\n<p>I have always savoured friendships. Like the letters that lay bound together in my glory box from twenty years ago, my friendships last, endure, continue. Some have diminished along the way. But with inventions such as Facebook, and plain old fashioned letter writing, I feel most of these people are as much a part of my life as they were when I lived amongst them.</p>\n<p>Although we no longer watch Sex In The City, because we are just too darn busy, we still eat ice-creams under gum trees and gossip about boys.

Mullet were being pulled in by the ger-dozen, and seaspray glided around in circles.

Hip hip hooray. I have never studied so much in my life, even without a little grublet to take care of. I was studying Abnormal Psychology and Learning and Memory, both of which turned out to be extremely heavy subject loads&#8230;and wasn&#8217;t helped by the chaotic and confusing teaching styles. In the end the exams weren&#8217;t too bad&#8230;in fact, I felt they were pretty easy. So fingers crossed.</p>\n<div>There are a surprising number of mums of young children in my external psychology classes. One girl lives on the Gold Coast and has two littlies, and I swear she is the most organised student I have ever met! Another lives at Suffolk Park with an eight month old baby and a 5 year old, so she struggled her way through semester&#8230;but appeared to do fine. As a friend mentioned recently, isn&#8217;t it amazing we can live in a time where we can raise young children and study a post-graduate diploma online. And even more so that the mums who are studying appear to be amongst the most diligent and well organised.</div>\n<p><div>There are a few reasons for this. The first is that for most of us, this course is a second time round, and unlike the first time round of studying where the primary aim was to pass, this time there is more at stake and we want to do well. The second is that we need to do well if we want to get into honours, and for most people studying psych, this is their aim, especially if they want to go on and practice. The third is that we have such little time available, that when we do get a chance to study we go for it with guns blazing. The Gold Coast lady mentioned above studies 6 hours straight on weekend days while her husband takes the kids. The Suffolk lady was trying to squeeze in as much as she could after babies/children were in bed &#8211; but as we all know, that is the most shattering time of day. Another lady I know works a few days a week, and has two kids under 5 and does two subjects online. Needless to say, she is just superwoman. I was fortunate to have Greg home 3 -4 days of the week so he could take Elka, and when my Mum is in town she plays with Elka while I study. Other days, I go between friends who take Elka for an hour here and there so I can do what I can. So I believe I have it pretty good.</div>\n<p><div>It&#8217;s great to study whilst being a mum, and for some, great to work. Another part of the brain is activated and we are challenged in different ways. At first I found it hard to go back, especially straight into statistics, as there was such a crevice between my maternal ways and the dry logic of stats and science. But it was also good having my own space and to commit myself to a goal, to be challenged and to work hard at something that wasn&#8217;t sucking on my boobs. In psychology, they call it the Protestant Ethic Effect &#8211; given the chance, even when it&#8217;s not necessary, we want to work. Even children and rats do it.</div>\n<p><div>But despite all that, I am glad to have a well earned break, catch up with friends, and watch Mad Men on DVD. Until it all begins again in three weeks time! Go Mums who study and work.

She is now 17 months old, and this has been often the easiest means for me to get her to sleep, but has sometimes been very frustrating. Some nights I lie there for an hour at night waiting for her to go to sleep, meanwhile wishing I could be out in the living room with Greg having dinner, or calling a friend, or finishing my study for the day. And sometimes it is really wonderful. I relax, and lie in a half dream state, thinking of stories to write, or reflecting on my life generally. Had you met me before I had Elka, I would have told you patience is <em>not</em>\u00a0one of my virtues, but over the last 17 months, I can honestly say patience has been finely tuned, and is now one of my strengths.</p>\n<p>I meet with a mums group fairly regularly, and often the subject that comes up is <em>sleep</em>. How is Elka sleeping? someone will ask, and I will reply: the same as she ever has. Ever since Elka was born, she has woken up every three to four hours at night for a feed. She sleeps next to me, and it has always been very easy to turn over, and give her a quick drink, and both of us go back to sleep immediately. Up until now, I have never had the heart to change this, as it has not hindered my energy levels &#8211; I wake feeling refreshed each morning &#8211; and I suspected Elka would protest strongly if ever I tried to change anything.</p>\n<p>But as time goes on, virtually all my mums group&#8217;s babies sleep through the night. Various strategies have been used, and I have listen in with a curious and slightly envious ear. Although my own sleep situation was palatable, I couldn&#8217;t help wishing for a full night&#8217;s sleep, and to not constantly be the means for my baby to go to sleep.</p>\n<p>So I made a decision &#8211; post exams, I would encourage Elka to sleep though, no feeding. I knew I had to be consistent and strong. I talked to many people, asked the <a title=\"Nifty Mums Network\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/NiftyMumsNetwork\">Nifty Mums Network</a>\u00a0for advice, and prepared myself mentally. Then one night, I did it. In dulcet tones, I told Elka that she can drink when the sun comes up and the birdies awake, and not before. Night is for sleeping. I lulled her back to sleep with a soft account of how the fairies make rain by dancing on the rainclouds, and at night live in bubbles beneath the ocean, emerging to the surface when rain is needed. Miraculously, it worked! Since I have refrained from feeding her, she has woken up once or twice a night with a little waa, and is easily encouraged back to sleep. We still sleep together, and this is something I don&#8217;t want to give up as I love waking up with her little smiling face next to mine.</p>\n<p>So I feel brave and proud and pleased. And happy that Elka has nearly achieve that long desired title of &#8220;sleeping through the night&#8221;.</p>\n", "post_id": 96, "location": false, "date": "06-04-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["two-year-olds", "empathy", "tantrums", "toddler"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/two.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/two.jpg?w=510\" alt=\"Image\" /></a></p>\n<p>As the tides of toddlerhood roll in, I find myself breathing deeply as I stand back and watch my toddler stretch and arch and turn red with fury. Welcome to what is affectionately known as &#8220;the terrible twos&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Common conversation with random lady in a shop:<br />\n&#8220;How old is your child?&#8221;<br />\n&#8220;Two.&#8221;<br />\n&#8220;Ah&#8230;[nod head knowingly]&#8230;the <em>terrible twos</em>&#8220;.</p>\n<p>I hate that phrase. In fact, while I am on the topic, I strongly dislike any phrase that negatively labels\u00a0my child. It is true that tantrums escalate at two, and emotion is strong, but they are hardly terrible. Elka emerges after an afternoon nap and declares: &#8220;I had a very good sleep&#8230;thank you very much.&#8221; Or thanks her daddy for brushing her teeth. Or passes her favourite toy to a friend. Or cocks her head to one side, and says: &#8220;Mummy, you sad? Oh, poor Mumma.&#8221; Or apologises when she accidentally bumps into you. Two is an age when language begins to flourish and our children grow from grublets who wriggle across the carpet and poo in their nappies to independent miniature people, eager to be part of the big world, and do poos and wees on their own, but still want to snuggle into their mummies&#8217; laps for comfort. Far from terrible twos. I think calling this period the &#8220;delightful twos&#8221; gives our two year olds more of a chance to fare well in the world.</p>\n<p>The language we use towards our children is so important, I believe. So is treating them as another person, just a smaller version of one. Of course, there are boundaries and rules, but is a two year old really going to understand why it&#8217;s not ok to grab a grape from the vege section in the supermarket, or why we have to eat pasta with a fork and not our grubby little fingers? Yes, Elka has tantrums, and yes tantrums press all my buttons, but there is one very important little ingredient we have with our breakfast cereal, and that is empathy. In case you didn&#8217;t know it, empathy makes the world go round. When Elka is throwing herself across the floor and turning purple, I try to think how she must be feeling. I remember my own teenage tantrums&#8230;far more violent and calculated, and am taken back to that dark place where the mind has become swallowed by tiny demons and the good version of myself can&#8217;t escape. Moments later, like a toddler, I couldn&#8217;t remember where the demons came from and what they represented. Throwing a tantrum feels like hell, and that&#8217;s why, although I am frustrated with Elka, I also feel bad for my little baby, and wish for her pain to pass. Inevitably, it does. Within seconds.</p>\n<p>Often her tantrums are caused by me being a slightly vague and forgetful mother. Like, when I forget to give her food, and realise that she is probably starving. Or when I accidentally mention Playschool but change my mind because it is actually time for dinner, rather than Playschool. So I think, is she rolling around the floor because I f*cked up? Sometimes, the answer is yes, definitely.</p>\n<p>And sometimes she is just copying me. I yell at Greg out of frustration or slam down a pan. It&#8217;s no wonder Elka feels the heat.</p>\n<p>I try and hug Elka when she is in her red-faced state, but often I&#8217;m pushed away. So I just let her know I am in the kitchen and when she&#8217;s ready, she can come to me. And quite often, she comes in on her own accord for a hug, because she realises that this is what she needs.</p>\n<p>Granted, she is only <em>just</em> two so we haven&#8217;t had any major supermarket incidents, or tantrums that last until bedtime. But as we go along our way, and Elka&#8217;s emotions and vocal chords become stronger, I think we will be ok.</p>\n", "post_id": 961, "location": false, "date": "02-01-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["parenthood", "smacking", "difficulties", "family"], "text": "<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/darkness.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Everything I believe about parenting centres on a loving and nurturing approach.

It is the one cause I would take to the streets, or go on the Today show to speak up against. I know it does no good, and I know there are alternative ways to teach children about life.</p>\n<p>I am not the perfect mother. I don&#8217;t even try to be. I try to be a loving mother, and that&#8217;s about all. I still check Facebook on my phone while Elka rocks on the\u00a0see-saw. On nights when my husband works, I buy pre-prepared meals so I don&#8217;t have to wash up. And laundry takes about a week to get from washing basket to a clean pile in the cupboard. Sometimes two.</p>\n<p>But there is a part of myself I resent. A dark shadow that rims the radiance. A monster. There is an uncontrollable temper that lives in me; something so deeply ingrained that even the haughtiest values will not quell its evil thirst. It is the monster that squeezes my daughter too tightly when I am mad. That yells into the face of a crying child out of shear frustration. That snatches a wet painting out of small hands before it lands on the couch. I remedy with a hug and a long apology, but I don&#8217;t know if my harshness will be forgotten. Perhaps it&#8217;s coded into Elka&#8217;s little mind and little heart; a seed of doubt planted that grows into a tree of distrust. It doesn&#8217;t happen much, but it has happened, and I resent everything about it. I just want to cry and crawl into a ball under a hot shower to make the pain go away.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://myblawghh.blogspot.com.au/2011/08/darkness.html\" target=\"_blank\">Image credit</a></p>\n", "post_id": 965, "location": false, "date": "02-14-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["library", "craft", "parents", "reading", "children", "playgroup"], "text": "<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.scenicreflections.com/files/Love_tree_Wallpaper_ofdgi.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"430\" height=\"323\" /></p>\n<p>In our little town, Tidy Town 1997, we have reading and craft at the community library every Tuesday morning. I went once last year, when Elka was fifteen months. She loved stories, so I was excited our own little tidy town offered a story reading event to keep us busy for half an hour each week. At the end of the session, the facilitator approached me, and asked me how old my daughter was.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Fifteen months, &#8221; I said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;She is too young. Children must be at least two to attend reading. It is inappropriate for her to attend.&#8221;</p>\n<p>OKAAAAY then. Weird.</p>\n<p>Over a year later, my daughter is two, and I have heard good things about reading time. So we returned this week.</p>\n<p>A sincere and middle-aged lady perched on a stool waiting for children to be still so she could begin to read. The theme was Valentine&#8217;s Day, so she had chosen books about kissing and loving ( in the most innocent, wholesome sense). She perched and waited. Children squiggled into place, and chatted animatedly to each other and to their mummies and grandmas.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Shhh,&#8221; directed the mummies and grandmas. &#8220;Be still.&#8221; One woman clasped her hand over her child&#8217;s mouth in an effort to silence her.</p>\n<p>At last, the sweet and innocent stories about loving and kissing began. One boy bravely got up off his bottom and walked over to stand in-front of the book. He was promptly ordered to sit down. He got up repeatedly, much to his mother&#8217;s dismay. Havoc reeked again when another little boy climbed on the table. &#8220;Boys,&#8221; a woman muttered.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This book is about kissing,&#8221; the sincere and middle-aged woman proceeded. &#8220;Do you all kiss your mummies?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; announced the grandma. &#8220;Daniel doesn&#8217;t like kissing. Boys don&#8217;t kiss.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The little boy, who previously climbed on the table, scrambled up to the sincere and middle-aged lady and planted a wet kiss on her cheek proving grandma wrong. Both women turned red.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Now we will make Valentine&#8217;s Day trees for mum or dad. Does everyone want to come to the table?&#8221;</p>\n<p>The picture the children were re-creating was very sweet. \u00a0Wool for branches and paper love hearts to stick to the branches. Each child was assigned a piece of paper, a glue-stick, a little bag of woollen strands and a little bag of paper hearts.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is how it&#8217;s done,&#8221; the sincere and middle-aged lady demonstrated, while all the mummies and grandmas watched attentively.</p>\n<p>Every mummy and grandma hung over their child, carefully directing the glue stick. They laid the wool to make branches. The paper hearts they stuck to the branches in appropriate places. One child hastened to stick a heart in an incorrect position. The corresponding mother promptly corrected the fault. Another child turned his picture side-ways so the branches hung in the wrong direction. The sincere and middle-aged woman reached across to turn the paper the right way. She then snatched a glue-stick from a child who was getting a little glue happy on the other side of the table.</p>\n<p>Daniel&#8217;s, or his grandma&#8217;s, picture of a Valentine&#8217;s Day heart was clearly the best. The branches stood straight and strong, and the hearts hung perfectly. Daniel in fact had very little to do with the creation, as his grandmother leaned over him, clasping the glue-stick, the wool, and each little heart, her tongue stuck between her teeth. Daniel sidled away from the desk without a word.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Boys,&#8221; Grandma said, &#8220;boys just don&#8217;t like craft. What can I do? Daniel doesn&#8217;t like craft. Never has, never will.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The only wobbly and strangely shaped tree, with love hearts falling in odd directions off the page was Elka&#8217;s. &#8220;This is for Daddy,&#8221; she announced proudly. And then did a pee on the carpet.</p>\n<p>Craft for children had become about creating the best replica of the model Valentine&#8217;s Day tree. Being two, three or four, the children depended on their doting mothers and grandmas to make the best tree. I&#8217;m sure all the daddy&#8217;s were still very proud.</p>\n", "post_id": 969, "location": false, "date": "02-17-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["imagination", "play", "lilly pilly", "children"], "text": "<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.bonsaisolutions.com.au/images/syzygium1.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>This evening, two little girls, one aged two and one aged three-point-five, ran to the fairy dell (three lilly pillies planted in a cluster). They yelp joyously, and hide under the protective shelter the trees offer.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The fox is after us!&#8221; the three-point-five-year old announces. &#8220;Quick, to the fairy dell! We must hide!&#8221;</p>\n<p>The girls giggle and wait, their little legs bouncing from the excitement the fox has caused.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Naughty fox!&#8221; they yell. &#8220;Go away! That silly fox&#8230;he&#8217;s still there.&#8221; More giggles.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; says the three-year old, &#8220;let&#8217;s throw these berries at him, maybe he&#8217;ll go away.&#8221; They litter the path with berries from the lilly pilly, but the fox remains.</p>\n<p>&#8220;How about you invite him in for tea? He actually looks quite friendly,&#8221; I suggest.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; they agree. That was a good idea. Together, they make salad and pizza from leaves and twigs and berries, and politely ask the fox to wait outside while the dinner cooks. &#8220;OK, fox, you can come in now.&#8221; The fox guzzles up his salad and pizza, and is then named Theodore after the chipmunk and given a stroke on the head.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Oh, he&#8217;s actually a really friendly fox,&#8221; the three-year old says. The two-year old agrees vigorously, and they squeal as they run home.</p>\n<p>Watching these two little people create a little fantasy world was such a privilege. More animals came, and others left. There was no limit to the wonderful things that could happen in the fairy dell. The two girls told each other stories, and giggled until their toes turned purple.</p>\n<p>I remember my own imaginary worlds of my childhood, tucked in olive trees, or under lantana branches. Families of bears, fairies and royals filled my days and kept me company under the warm sun. I remember these fantasy worlds better than most of the &#8216;real&#8217; things that happened.</p>\n<p>Children have an incredible capacity for imagination. Their worlds are so fluid and magical. So much can happen. Anyone, anything can come and go. It&#8217;s such a beautiful thing, to imagine&#8230;to create. I could have sat there my whole life, revelling in the magic these two tiny people were weaving&#8230;out of nothing, but berries, twigs and leaves.</p>\n", "post_id": 976, "location": false, "date": "02-19-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["television", "family", "entertainment", "TV", "Playschool", "children"], "text": "<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/images.theage.com.au/ftage/ffximage/2008/11/05/playschool_wideweb__470x324,0.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>There is a quirk to being two. An up-shot. A right of passage. You get to be assertive. Say &#8216;no&#8217;. Enforce your boundaries. Parents may not do as they are told, but they sure as god\u00a0<em>will</em> listen. This is your prerogative being two. Being heard. Having your say.</p>\n<p>And hence 1,000 times a day, Elka tells me she &#8220;needs to watch Playschool&#8221;. It is not a want, or a desire. It is a need. Like food or water or love. And 999 times a day, I have to tell her sorry, but no. We only watch Playschool after your afternoon nap.</p>\n<p>When we were young and free, a bachelor couple you could say, we had a TV but we didn&#8217;t have an\u00a0aerial\u00a0connection. It was part laziness and part forcing ourselves not to watch crappy TV, only endless series like Six Feet Under or The Soprano&#8217;s. And then the Australian Open rolled around, and we\u00a0<em>needed</em> to get an aerial connection. It was a must.</p>\n<p>When we moved to our current house, we left the TV behind. We knew that having it there would entice us, and besides, there was no room. Instead we would spend evenings painting, drawing and writing. But the Australian Open was on again, so we\u00a0<em>needed</em> to get a TV tuner for our dodgy laptop. It was a must.</p>\n<p>In boredom, or for want of new entertainment, one afternoon I googled Playschool and set Elki up on a chair in front of the laptop. \u00a0The people would stop talking as the Internet connection froze up. They would freeze mid jump or mid song. But Elki didn&#8217;t care. She was mesmerised. And so the incessant requests for Playschool began.</p>\n<p>Luckily for Elka, the Australian Open was just around the corner, and so we ditched the TV tuner on the laptop and up-graded to a very large square TV dug up from storage &#8211; probably the only TV that isn&#8217;t a flat screen in our street. The quality is pretty crap, and it takes up half our living room, but the people no longer freeze mid jump or mid song. Because Elki sleeps during the Playschool airing, I bought the DVDs for her birthday and she watches them on loop.</p>\n<p>The only time Playschool goes on is after the afternoon nap. So, this morning, when Elka said for the 600th time that she\u00a0<em>needed\u00a0</em>to watch Playschool, I explained that she can watch it after her nap. Even though it was only 9am, Elka put herself to bed to wake up five seconds later. Of course, when I explained that that didn&#8217;t constitute an\u00a0<em>afternoon</em> nap, she threw herself around for a bit before finding something else to focus on.</p>\n<p>You can quote me on this&#8230;I don&#8217;t like Hi-5, animations, Teletubbies or whatever the contemporary equivalent is. Kid&#8217;s TV is so nutty. But Playschool is awesome. The people interact with you (I mean, the kids) without belittling you (oops, the kids). The games are fun, simple and interesting. They cover\u00a0<em>everything</em> from whales, to rabbits to tambourines. I love how they act like kids having fun. It&#8217;s such a great program. Really,<em> I need</em> to watch Playschool more than once a day, but I have to draw the line somewhere.</p>\n<p>While I write this blog, Justine and Alex are singing to my daughter about Peter Rabbit. Elka squeals occasionally for joy, or joins in singing. The rest of the time, her expression is serious and focused, as she clasps a doll fondly called Jemima.</p>\n<p>Elka&#8217;s happy. I&#8217;m happy. It&#8217;s Playschool.</p>\n", "post_id": 980, "location": false, "date": "02-23-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Lifeline", "motherhood", "suffering", "pain"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/vintage-children-in-nest.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image aligncenter\" src=\"https://allaboutbeingamummy.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/vintage-children-in-nest.jpg?w=487\" alt=\"Image\" /></a></p>\n<p>Today, I heard so much pain and sadness. I am not sure if my little mama&#8217;s heart can handle this much suffering.</p>\n<p>I had my first<a title=\"Lifeline\" href=\"http://www.lifeline.org.au/\" target=\"_blank\"> Lifeline</a> shift this morning &#8220;flying solo&#8221;. There was a supervisor in the building, and another crisis supporter, so I had company. But there was just me on one end of the phone, and someone in a lot of pain on the other.</p>\n<p>I spoke to the first woman for about twenty-five minutes. She had grown up being sexually abused by her father and her grandfather. She had then been in a domestic violence marriage for many years. Now she was single with grown up children. She was sad because she felt she had no-one to turn to, and no-one to trust. She sounded like such a beautiful person &#8211; so giving and generous and kind. I held these gifts out for her&#8230;reflected back her beautiful and kind spirit, and she took it gladly.</p>\n<p>My next call was a suicide intervention. The young man was very depressed and suffered from <a title=\"OCD\" href=\"http://www.sane.org/information/factsheets-podcasts\" target=\"_blank\">OCD</a>. He spent most of his time when not working in his room staring at the carpet. He doubted himself constantly; he felt stupid and worthless. He couldn&#8217;t imagine any other way but to end it all. We talked for over an hour. There were things he wanted to live for&#8230;we just needed to find them. In the end, he promised me he would keep safe, and would call his friend this afternoon. I hope he did.</p>\n<p>As soon as I set the phone to ready again, it rang, and I took yet another suicide call. A man cried and cried into the phone. He had thought about suicide all weekend, and this morning flagged down his neighbour asking for help. She called Lifeline. He has recently stopped smoking dope, without any support, and lies every day feeling empty and alone with only his busy mind. We promised me he would go straight to hospital to try to find help. I hope he did.</p>\n<p>This afternoon, my daughter has also been crying. She has a cold, and as it does every time, the cold has gone to her chest and she has a nasty cough. She hasn&#8217;t eaten much for three days, and her sleep has been fitful. She woke up from her afternoon nap crying. She cried her way through dinner, which she didn&#8217;t eat anyway, and then rolled on the floor in a fit of sadness and frustration because I didn&#8217;t have the right icy-pole for her. Finally, listening to &#8220;If I had words&#8221; (from the <a title=\"Babe sountrack\" href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112431/soundtrack\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Babe\u00a0</em>soundtrack</a>) my shield collapsed, and I did too, crying for the first time in months. At once, Elka&#8217;s tears stopped and she looked into my eyes. &#8220;Mumma, are you OK?&#8221; She stroked my face with her tiny hand.</p>\n<p>I was proud of myself today. My bowl of love and giving was full, but didn&#8217;t spill. I contained all the pain and emotion that crossed my path. I was able to hold it all. Caring for a sad and sick child was the last thing I felt I could handle today, but I did, and I could. A mother&#8217;s strength is deep as the ocean. Just when you think you have gone as deep as you can go, you fall deeper, and the sea gets darker and colder.</p>\n", "post_id": 984, "location": false, "date": "03-05-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["craft", "babushka dolls", "sewing"], "text": "<p>In the lull between uni semesters, I am getting crafty.</p>\n<p>There is a part of me that remains convinced that I am the crafty type. Whilst living in Melbourne, I was part of a craft-a-noon. We met very occasionally, and there was tea and crocheting (I believe it was my brother who was invited to teach us all the crochet!) and then craft-a-noon slowly became craft-once-in-a-blue-moon.</p>\n<p>I sewed as a kid &#8211; I went to sewing classes instead of Brownies, and have been glad ever since for the skill of sewing an\u00a0appliqu\u00e9\u00a0teddy bear onto a polka dot sweater is far more useful in life than tying a knot.

It seemed everyone I had something in common with was a sewer or a crafter, so in November last year, I embarked on a mission to do a market stall &#8211; collaborate with all my lady folk who craft, and put together something splendid. Our Alstonville Mummy&#8217;s Market was splendid, though we sold one thing. And the further attempts to put together another stall were foiled, by rain, of course.</p>\n<p>And as my interest in writing increased, as did my commitment to my studies, my belief in my crafting abilities slowly died. Until tonight &#8211; tonight, everyone, I whipped up not one by TWO babushka dolls all from the inspiration of my heart, from scraps of fabric that belonged to my grandma or to me.

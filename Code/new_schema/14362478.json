The cormorants would retreat and regroup every couple of minutes, congregating on the opposite cliffs to ponder their next move (which mainly consisted of waiting for the gulls to get bored and leave long enough for them to make another thatch run).

They were the last modern toilets encountered all day, so depending on one&#8217;s proclivities for bare-cheeked relief in the woods, this could either be a very good or a very bad thing. Despite the noxious\u00a0strawberry-scented urinal cakes, there was still loveliness. This delicate Pale Beauty Moth, <a href=\"http://bugguide.net/node/view/13845\"><em>Campaea perlata</em></a>,\u00a0cleverly decided to be born nearly\u00a0the same shade as the paint.<a href=\"https://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/silver-star15.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1953\" src=\"https://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/silver-star15.jpg?w=584&#038;h=451\" alt=\"Silver Star15\" width=\"584\" height=\"451\" /></a>Moulton was a double-edged sword, though. I had gotten there early enough to avoid the disappointing\u00a0carnival of humanity, so its legendary humidity had not burned off yet under the sun. My stroll to the <a href=\"http://www.clark.wa.gov/publicworks/parks/moultonfalls.html\">scenic bridge</a> was as sticky as a high school locker room.<a href=\"https://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/silver-star3.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1951\" src=\"https://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/silver-star3.jpg?w=584&#038;h=432\" alt=\"Silver Star3\" width=\"584\" height=\"432\" /></a>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_River_(Washington)\">East Fork Lewis River</a> was a wet mirror that admired the sky while\u00a0concealing a frenetic world of trout and crayfish below. White petals floated down with every breeze and were borne away on a sleepy current. It was like a scene from a medieval romance novel not written by J.K. Rowling.<a href=\"https://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/silver-star14.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1952\" src=\"https://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/silver-star14.jpg?w=584&#038;h=402\" alt=\"Silver Star14\" width=\"584\" height=\"402\" /></a>Then the fun began. Every hiking book, every sign, and every person who&#8217;s ever been there will tell you the route to the north trailhead\u00a0is not for low slung vehicles.

After innumerable bottomless\u00a0potholes, a hairpin turn that made my axles whine, and a gully that could have concealed a small horse, I was inclined to agree. I had to access the dormant Colorado 4x4ing part of my brain just to navigate that gully.</p>\n<p>Yet, sitting there at the trailhead, was a red sports car. It was covered in mud and had\u00a0the look of something that an insurance agent would soon be walking around with a clipboard and a frown.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/silver-star-duct-tape.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-1973\" src=\"https://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/silver-star-duct-tape.jpeg?w=280&#038;h=350\" alt=\"silver star duct tape\" width=\"280\" height=\"350\" /></a>A hiking buddy is gratifying\u00a0but a solo hike ensures serenity. Almost. Starting at the same time as I was a family of miscellaneous children, a father figure, and a mother with a voice like a Brazilian soccer announcer. Every topic that crossed her mind&#8211;the weather, the time, the location of her backup bottle of sunscreen&#8211;was delivered at top decibels. I suddenly decided to fall back and retie my hiking boots for fifteen minutes. I didn&#8217;t hear the birds again until she had marched half a mile away, cowering brood in tow.<a href=\"https://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/silver-star24.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1971\" src=\"https://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/silver-star24.jpg?w=584&#038;h=438\" alt=\"Silver Star24\" width=\"584\" height=\"438\" /></a>The prime reason Silver Star made my heart go pit-a-pat was its uncanny resemblance to the high tundra of Colorado. In 1902 the largest forest fire in Washington history, the <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fsbdev3_004902.pdf\">Yacolt Burn</a>, swept over the area\u00a0and trees failed to reseed. As a result, rocky\u00a0fields and open meadows now blasted my view wide open. The sky felt huge.

I decided against his approach of doing it all in one day because I wanted to live. Instead, I broke it up into chunks and traveled at a meditative pace, absorbing each nuance at my leisure.</p>\n<p>Wildwood Trail meanders like a jagged river up and down the hills and in and out of the drainage ravines of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_Park_(Portland,_Oregon)\">Forest Park</a>. Well-maintained and easy to follow, it&#8217;s a day hiker&#8217;s paradise when you don&#8217;t feel like driving too far out of town. In fact, you don&#8217;t even have to leave Portland&#8211;at 5,100 wooded\u00a0acres, it&#8217;s the largest, forested natural area within city limits in the United States. This means two things: it&#8217;s easy and well-traveled. Not exactly the intense solo bushwhacks I&#8217;m used to but, hey, it beckoned.</p>\n<p>The entire green strip is Forest Park:<div class=\"googlemaps\"><iframe width=\"425\" height=\"350\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"https://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&amp;ll=45.562622,-122.76432&amp;spn=0.132925,0.308647&amp;t=h&amp;z=12&amp;output=embed\"></iframe><br /><small><a href=\"https://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&amp;ll=45.562622,-122.76432&amp;spn=0.132925,0.308647&amp;t=h&amp;z=12&amp;source=embed\" style=\"text-align:left\">View Larger Map</a></small></div></p>\n<p>I accessed my starting points each day via <a href=\"http://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.wordpress.com/2011/09/30/the-trails-of-forest-park/\">side trails</a> and<a href=\"http://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.wordpress.com/2011/09/04/forest-park-firelanes-2/\"> fire lanes</a> that are scattered throughout the park, then backtracked to my vehicle. (<a href=\"http://www.pdxparks.org/maps/natural_areas/forest_park_trail_map_070711.pdf\">Large map download</a>)\u00a0This accounts for the higher mileage I racked up than just the Wildwood sections. I tried to keep it under eight miles at a crack out of consideration for my feet and an interminable distaste for humidity. Forest Park can be a dripping sauna in the summertime and I am definitely one of those fall/winter types. A near-solid canopy of trees overhead and the fact that every trail is positioned on the east side of the hill meant that I had enough shade to avoid applying a single dab of sunscreen. Bug spray, on the other hand, I wore like a second skin. You pause for five seconds in Forest Park and you instantly become a vending machine for mosquitoes. DEET, hallowed be thy name.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/fp_trail_medium-scaled1000.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-638\" title=\"Maple Trail, Forest Park, Portland, Oregon, USA\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/fp_trail_medium-scaled1000.jpg?w=640&#038;h=426\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>6-25-11 \u00a0Newberry Road to Newton Road</strong> \u00a04 Wildwood miles down, 26 to go</p>\n<p>My favorite part of Forest Park is definitely the north end. The topography is more open, the foliage understory looser, affording a better view through the trees, and there are almost no people. It&#8217;s serenity makes you feel like you are miles away from civilization. The trail is in better condition, too, drier and more even. This is probably why my planned inaugural hike of 4 miles turned into eight without a second thought.</p>\n<p>I headed out in early evening to enjoy the cooler air and quiet. The whole earth seemed paused, holding it&#8217;s breath before exhaling into night. The secret sounds of birds and small, furry animals skittering around in the undergrowth were loud in the dim light. I received a lot of\u00a0inadvertent\u00a0spider web and moth kisses. White shelf fungus glowed along tree trunks. The sweet, moist smell of oxygen and green, growing things hung in the air.</p>\n<p>A brood of <a href=\"http://voiceinthegarden.blogspot.com/2011/01/red-breasted-sapsucker.html\">Northern Red-breasted Sapsuckers</a>\u00a0cackled from a hole in a tree trunk above my head, their whiny racket reaching a fever pitch whenever the adult arrived at their hole to deliver another feeding. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harpaphe_haydeniana\">Millipedes</a> and <a href=\"http://calphotos.berkeley.edu/cgi/img_query?enlarge=0000+0000+0502+1252\">carnivorous ground beetles</a> made like speed racers across the trail while giant\u00a0<a href=\"http://robinloznakphotography.blogspot.com/2010/05/pacific-banana-slug.html\">Banana Slugs</a> and <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/copepodo/2579500403/\">Arions</a> took their sweet, slimy time.

I slept well tonight.</p>\n<p><em>8.5 miles today, 8.5 cumulative total</em></p>\n<p><strong>6-27-11 Newton Road to Springville Road</strong>\u00a0 7.75 Wildwood miles down, 22.25 to go</p>\n<p>Today was humid. God, it was humid. It was so freaking humid, I don&#8217;t think I was actually hiking, it felt more like swimming. I was doing the breast-stroke through air so heavy you could pet it. Bugs were floating on the surface of it like flotsam. My plan of 8.5 miles disintegrated at the site of a short cut back to my vehicle near the end. Still, I managed to bag the section of Wildwood Trail that I wanted. Next time, though, I&#8217;m bringing a ton more water.</p>\n<p>There was plenty of reward for toughing it out. I nudged a <a href=\"http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~titus/herp/vehiculum.html\">Western red-backed salamander</a> off the trail to get him out of the path of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xn9dJ1Ku1U&amp;feature=related\">trail runners</a>. He did a slimy, jerking version of the Lambada in an effort to scare me off. It didn&#8217;t work, he was just too cute. More Red-breasted Sapsucker nests; it&#8217;s like the Sapsucker Suburbs out there. I heard a handful of robins sounding their warning screeches but didn&#8217;t spot any danger. Passing back that way again on the return trip, I paused to see what they were on about. I looked up: nothing. I looked down: nothing. I look&#8211;Holy Crap, a <a href=\"http://www.owl-pictures.com/barred_owl.html\">Barred Owl</a> just exploded from a small tree directly in front of me! The camouflage feathers on these guys is legendary.

Not only does it form a near-perfect 4.5 mile loop that places you right back at your vehicle, but it has the most variety of topography. The trail is dense, then open, up on the ridge, then deep in a drainage, flat as a jogging track, then steep enough to make your glutes whimper. On top of it all, the oldest growth of firs and hemlocks in the park live here so the trunks you pass are more magnificent and the canopy is taller.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/p6120627.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-632\" title=\"OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/p6120627.jpg?w=300&#038;h=234\" width=\"300\" height=\"234\" /></a></p>\n<p>There were more horseshoe prints on Springville Road than boot prints, so I&#8217;ll look forward to seeing some wildlife of the equine persuasion there in the future. Today, it was all about the snails. The most impressive ones&#8211;and the largest&#8211;were the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3SHrE_L3V4\">Pacific Sidebands</a>.

At the intersection of Springville Road and Hardesty Trail stands a tree so ornately decorated with bright white shelf fungi that it stops you dead in your tracks. I suddenly missed my camera. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubus_spectabilis\">Salmonberries</a>\u00a0are coming ripe all over but aren&#8217;t quite at the sweet stage yet. (Ack! Ptooey!) <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxalis\">Wood Sorrel</a>, with it&#8217;s lemony vinegar tang is far more refreshing to chew on.</p>\n<p>I made a side trip down Hardesty Trail to check out the <a href=\"http://www.thingstodoinportland.org/big-stump-forest-park/\">Big Stump</a> all the maps talk about.

Once you&#8217;ve seen the big boys, the young &#8216;uns just don&#8217;t impress anymore. The stalks of <a href=\"http://www.wildflower.org/plants/result.php?id_plant=LICO\">Columbia Lilies</a> are getting ready to pop into bright orange lanterns and with all this rain, I&#8217;ve never seen them so tall.

If ever there was a section of Wildwood Trail that needed a weed whacker and a chainsaw, this is the one. I spent half the time with my arms in the air while <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stinging_nettle\">Stinging nettle</a>, <a href=\"http://slugyard.com/2010/09/natures-toilet-paper/\">Thimbleberry</a>, and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polystichum_munitum\">Swordfern</a> swatted me across the midriff. There were so many logs to vault over and crouch under, I stopped counting. Still, it was a beautiful day. By the by, Thimbleberry is. Not. Tasty. Take a raspberry and remove about 90% of the flavor. Now, make it mealy and soft. Lastly, make it a muddy, sweaty chore just to collect a cup of them. Pass. I&#8217;ll hold out for the super-sweet, winey blackberries in about a month, thanks.</p>\n<p>Thimbleberries<a href=\"http://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/thimbleberries.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-654\" title=\"thimbleberries\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/thimbleberries.jpg?w=640&#038;h=471\" width=\"640\" height=\"471\" /></a>The trick to enjoying such a public trail on a holiday weekend is to get there early. By the time I got back, there were cars lined up and idling, waiting for my parking spot. They should have been there at 9 AM when the air was cool, the forest was silent, and the bees in that hive right next to the trail were still asleep. I heard multiple reports that they definitely woke up later on. My own intimate wildlife encounter involved a nest of newly-hatched robins just a few feet over my head. A much sweeter sound than the Sapsuckers, to be sure. Also sweet were the F15&#8217;s flying formations overhead for the Fourth of July, their dark metal wings cutting giant patterns in the sky, their afterburners booming with indescribable power. Love that.</p>\n<p>Swordfern</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/sword4.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-653\" title=\"sword4\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/sword4.jpg?w=640&#038;h=426\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" /></a></p>\n<p>I heard a third piece of music in the forest, although a bittersweet one. Cicadas have begun their long, slow songs in the trees, wheezing like sleepy accordions in the heat. This always signals that the summer is more than half over and picking up speed into fall. I don&#8217;t know why a lingering sadness sweeps over me whenever I hear that tune because I adore fall above all seasons. Must be a leftover memory from school days when the freedoms of summer must come to a close. It usually accompanies a subtle but noticeable shift in the light and the length of days. Our spring was late this year; summer just began this weekend. Maybe the cicadas are confused. Or maybe they know something we don&#8217;t&#8230;.</p>\n<p>Longest day hike in over a decade today.

The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pteridium_aquilinum\">Bracken Fern</a> was seven feet across and five feet high, each plant. The Sword Ferns were up to my chest. It was eerie and prehistoric. I felt like I was walking through the movie set of Jurassic Park 3 and a Velociraptor would burst from the green at any moment, eager to reduce my face to bloody sauce in one bite.</p>\n<p>Bracken fern<a href=\"http://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/adelaarsvaren_planten_pteridium_aquilinum.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-655\" title=\"Adelaarsvaren_planten_Pteridium_aquilinum\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/adelaarsvaren_planten_pteridium_aquilinum.jpg?w=640&#038;h=877\" width=\"640\" height=\"877\" /></a></p>\n<p>In reality, all I witnessed were his very, very distant descendants&#8211;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_Warbler\">Yellow</a>\u00a0and <a href=\"http://birdweb.org/birdweb/bird_details.aspx?id=399\">Wilson&#8217;s Warblers</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http://birding.about.com/od/birdprofiles/ig/Pictures-of-Juncos/Junco---Oregon.htm\">Oregon Juncos</a> and the usual noisy <a href=\"http://nwbackyardbirder.blogspot.com/2011/02/barely-spotted-towhees-get-super.html\">Towhee</a> or two. Far more curious than clever, they succumbed to my calls without hesitation and within 30 seconds, I had a dozen or more just a few feet away. They bounced and fluttered from branch to branch, beady little eyes locked on me, a cloud of questioning tweets, chirps, and churgs filling the air around us. Cute as all get out.</p>\n<p>Wilson&#8217;s Warbler<a href=\"http://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/wilsons-warbler.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-651\" title=\"Wilsons-Warbler\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/wilsons-warbler.jpg?w=541&#038;h=370\" width=\"541\" height=\"370\" /></a></p>\n<p>The closest I came to carnage was Banana Slugs. If you stick your finger about an inch in front of one and let him slowly advance upon it, he will stop, pull in his antennae, then gingerly stick them back out, wrap his mouth around your fingertip, and proceed to chew. The sensation is bizarre and comical: imagine the raspy tongue of a large dog or cow scraping along your skin, causing micro-vibrations. Not much of a threat. It was so amusing, I did it three times. The largest slug was bigger around than my finger and over twice as long, a slug body builder. I wonder if I could train him to chase the squirrels out of my garden&#8230;.</p>\n<p>Red Huckleberries<a href=\"http://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/red-huckleberries.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-652\" title=\"red-huckleberries\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/red-huckleberries.jpg?w=640&#038;h=432\" width=\"640\" height=\"432\" /></a></p>\n<p>This hike was the longest I managed to go without seeing a single person. It was bliss until I came upon a large fire lane access road about the same time that people let out of work. Enter the hordes, the unwashed hordes. I&#8217;m not sure what sort of socio-political statement going without baths and deodorant makes but put me down for &#8220;No.&#8221; I&#8217;m just glad I only had to pass them once. And the wind was going the other way. And my mouth wasn&#8217;t open. I had to sniff the bugspray on my arm just to cleanse my palate. I consoled myself by munching on the first <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccinium_parvifolium\">red huckleberries</a> of the season. They&#8217;re so tiny, eight of them would barely fill a teaspoon but any sweet thing found is a treat.

I hiked and chewed. Almost every bush was decorated like a Christmas tree with edible red ornaments. The <a href=\"http://science.halleyhosting.com/nature/basin/5petal/honey/sam/red.htm\">Red Elderberries</a> were flashing even larger, more impressive displays. Combined with the fluorescent orange of the Columbia Lilies, it was one gorgeous trail.</p>\n<p>Red Elderberry <em>Sambucus racemosa arborescens<a href=\"http://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/red-elderberry2.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-668\" title=\"Red elderberry2\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/red-elderberry2.jpg?w=640&#038;h=853\" width=\"640\" height=\"853\" /></a></em></p>\n<p>I passed a tall white snag almost completely drilled with vertical rectangular <a href=\"http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Pileated_Woodpecker/lifehistory\">Pileated Woodpecker</a> holes, a cubist totem pole. Later on, I was treated to an exciting fly-by from the artist. They are as big as crows but they move through the trees like Lear jets, very fast and sleek. Then, they surprise you with cartoon voices too high and comical for such large creatures, they&#8217;re like the Mike Tysons of the forest. I guess it goes with the hairstyle.</p>\n<p>Pileated Woodpecker<a href=\"http://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/pileatedwoodpecker1-21.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-672\" title=\"PileatedWoodpecker1-2\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/pileatedwoodpecker1-21.jpg?w=640&#038;h=809\" width=\"640\" height=\"809\" /></a></p>\n<p>Around 8 PM, evening fell heavily on the trail and the humidity shot up so high I couldn&#8217;t tell if my shirt was wet from my own efforts or the air&#8217;s. The snails came out in force and so did a variation on the Arions: red slugs. Their coloring reminds you of a wet red brick. Tiny white moths started floating around aimlessly. Every time I passed a patch of <a href=\"http://www.kingcounty.gov/environment/animalsAndPlants/noxious-weeds/weed-identification/english-ivy.aspx\">English Ivy</a>, the pungent smell of it caught my attention before its leaves did. Fellow hikers do not seem to know what I mean, they can&#8217;t detect the difference in aroma between Thimbleberry, Oregon Grape, and English Ivy.

The Portland <a href=\"http://audubonportland.org/sanctuaries/visiting/nature-store\">Audubon Society Nature Store</a> within their <a href=\"http://audubonportland.org/sanctuaries/visiting\">sanctuary</a> on Cornell was just closing and I caught a break with their nice bathroom, using the sink for a water bottle refill. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balch_Creek\">Balch Creek</a> below them is the only water way in the entire park large enough to sustain a rocky bottom and four-season waterfalls. The sound of water over rocks is a far richer music than water over soil, with a broader acoustical range. It soothes like Mozart. I felt a definite inner pull to my autumn hiking range, Mt. Hood, where the glacial run offs ring out into the clear, thin air like full, roaring orchestras.</p>\n<p>Breaking my previous record, this is now my longest solo hike in Oregon. My hamstrings and arches will vouch for me.</p>\n<p><em>11.5 miles today, 50.5 cumulative total</em></p>\n<p><strong>7-20-11 Cornell Road to Oregon Zoo</strong> 30+ miles of Wildwood Trail completed</p>\n<p>I have to admit, the only reasons I was looking forward to doing this final segment was to A: See a few tiny areas I hadn&#8217;t been to yet and B: Get &#8216;er done. The trail topography is steepest here and very muddy, kind of a double whammy. If you&#8217;re not wearing bug spray at this slow pace, you&#8217;re going to exhaust your list of expletives in the first mile. But don&#8217;t worry about smelling like Cutter or Off!, your scent will be handily overpowered by the constant stream of perfume-drenched joggers that pass you. This is a curiosity to me: what exactly are they all dolled up for? Each other? I started noticing them around Firelane 1. The closer you get to the city, the closer you get to &#8220;civilization&#8221; and all its bizarre vicissitudes.</p>\n<p>Pittock Mansion<a href=\"http://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/pittock.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-684\" title=\"pittock\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/pittock.jpg?w=592&#038;h=333\" width=\"592\" height=\"333\" /></a></p>\n<p>Besides the traffic noise, which is an ever present drone in the forest here, there is the delightful traffic atmosphere. Exhaust fumes hang in the humid air around Cornell and Burnside Roads so thickly that your tongue tastes like WD-40 after about 10 minutes. Luckily, I met a friendly trail runner who walked with me to <a href=\"http://pittockmansion.org/\">Pittock Mansion</a> and helped improve my mood&#8211;Thanks, Gary! But it would have taken Prozac in a Pez dispenser to keep me smiling on through to the Oregon Zoo, that was chaos in a bottle. Cars crawling around an over-stuffed parking lot in the heat, ice cream streaked children screaming and crying and running around everywhere, angry parents alternately barking at their children and honking their horns at imaginary enemies. Bedlam. Suffice it to say, this was the one time I did not take a few minutes to pause at my turning point to soak up the ambiance. The one pocket of calm in the entire day was the all-to-brief section that overlooks the <a href=\"http://japanesegarden.com/\">Japanese Gardens</a>. I peered a hundred feet down and spotted a few fluorescent colored <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koi\">Koi</a> trolling the reflecting pools below like plump orange submarines.

There is a trail junction every hundred yards on average and the ones that are labeled are labeled wrong, and I mean <em>really</em> wrong. I made it this far without losing my way once but now I was pausing every fifteen minutes and squinting at the map. The trick is that the exorbitantly priced &#8220;Hiking and Running Guide to Forest Park&#8221; does not show much detail in this section of the index map and the separate map blow-ups that come with it omit it entirely. I stopped a handful of locals and tried to get a bearing but they didn&#8217;t have a clue, either. In the end, I put in an extra half mile backtracking things and wandering around parking lots. Alex, I don&#8217;t know how you survived this section in the dark at the end of your Wildwood marathon. \u00a0I would have been sending up flares and waiting for the helicopters.</p>\n<p><em>10.5 miles today, 61 miles cumulative total</em></p>\n<p>Well, it&#8217;s done. I&#8217;m proud and feelin&#8217; pretty sanctimonious about all my confirmed suspicions about staying as far away from the city as possible and hiking at off hours to avoid the hordes. I received nary a bug bite in 61 miles thanks to copious amounts of spray, an accomplishment unrealized in years past. I also managed to wake up each following day with zero soreness, a miracle in itself. Mt. Hood is still melting, so I think I&#8217;ll do all the <a href=\"http://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.wordpress.com/2011/08/14/gettin-elevated-in-forest-park/\">roads</a> and <a href=\"http://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.wordpress.com/2011/09/04/forest-park-firelanes-2/\">firelanes</a> next to cover August.

All the non-vehicle roads that crisscross the park go one better by extending past park boundaries from NW Skyline Boulevard at the very tippy top all the way down to Highway 30 along the Columbia River.

Where the road and Firelane 13 part company, the bottom literally drops out from under you into a very steep decline. The gravel beneath your feet becomes a fast moving conveyor belt of rolling curses, slips, and dropped water bottles. Luckily, the view makes up for it (above). Do it before 10 AM in the summertime to take advantage of as much shade from the tall Doug firs as possible, after 1 PM in the winter when you&#8217;re desperate for light. There&#8217;s parking for about four vehicles at the trailhead but it&#8217;s tough to see, so just look for the pale blue house on your left about a mile past Germantown Road, the entrance is right across the street from it.

The earth falls away there on the edge at angles so steep, they are nearly cliffs, and you feel vaulted above the river valley. The wind races through this green crevasse, bringing fresh air and luscious white noise to drown the highway. As you creep downwards towards the creek, its music rises up, too, as well as a thousand bushes and branches that turn the trail into jungle again. At the end, it all opens out into an honest to goodness little field full of waist high grasses, asters, and tansy.

There is one quaint reminder that the route follows a water line (below).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/p9097045-005.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-919\" title=\"OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/p9097045-005.jpg?w=640&#038;h=472\" width=\"640\" height=\"472\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>8-10-11 Springville Road</strong> 940&#8242; elevation gain, 3.5 miles RT</p>\n<p>Although BPA and Springville Roads lose about the same amount of elevation over the same number of miles, Springville descends at nearly the same rate the entire way while BPA stays relatively flat, then drops like a stone. This makes Springville a great training ground for the inclines of Mt. Hood&#8211;in fact it reminds me very much of the routes that deliver you to Timberline Trail. Past the terminus of Forest Park at the bottom, Springville becomes gravel, then paved, then deposits you right at a route 16 bus stop on NW Bridge Avenue. On the way down you can make out Mt. St. Helens in the distance if it&#8217;s clear.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1060800-022.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-822\" title=\"P1060800 022\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1060800-022.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.butterfliesandmoths.org/species/Limenitis-lorquini\">Lorquin&#8217;s Admiral</a> butterfly (left)</p>\n<p><strong>8-14-11 Gas Line Road &amp;\u00a0Oil Line Roads</strong>\u00a0990&#8242; elevation gain, 4.25 miles RT (Foot traffic only)</p>\n<p>Gas and Oil Line Roads are also known as Firelanes 7 and 7A, respectively. They start out wider than a two lane street that stays relatively flat for almost a mile, then they branch into separate routes that each narrow to a steep and curvy trail. Oil Line Road is decorated with an ocean of Swordfern and ends at Leif Erikson in an ugly, eroded wall so steep, it is nearly impossible to descend&#8211;a sad testament to the devastation that unchecked mountain biking can wreak. Gas Line Road has similar damage but a more manageable elevation drop. They are the only roads in Forest Park that do not bear a\u00a0smidgen\u00a0of gravel anywhere on them for purchase so I don&#8217;t recommend either one in winter. Gas Line Road continues all the way down to the bottom of the park via an almost invisible route through brambles, blow downs, and a sea of zesty\u00a0<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melissa_officinalis\">Lemon Balm</a>. (Stinging Nettle is the spitting image of Lemon Balm to the untrained eye, so don&#8217;t grab anything and smell it unless you&#8217;re absolutely sure.) The very last five hundred yards or so of road is an obvious cutbank into the basalt cliffs above and has remnants of low concrete posts where a wooden safety railing used to be.

It is, hands down, the driest, best four-season road in all of Forest Park. I&#8217;m gonna remember it next winter when I&#8217;m dying to get out but don&#8217;t want to scrape mud off my pants afterwards for an hour. The lower terminus of Forest Park is a gate near Linnton and there is plenty of parking there, but you can trek another 0.70 miles to bus line 16 on the Columbia Highway if you want. There are several openings in the trees where a nice pic of <a href=\"http://www.portlandneighborhood.com/stjohns.html\">St. John&#8217;s</a> and/or the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burlington_Northern_Railroad_Bridge_5.1\">Burlington Northern Railroad Bridge 5.1</a>\u00a0can be had when the sun is right.

The <a href=\"http://www.bentler.us/eastern-washington/animals/insects/butterflies/oregon-swallowtail-butterfly.aspx\">Oregon Swallowtails</a> are everywhere but they&#8217;re cagey and they don&#8217;t pause very long for\u00a0paparazzi, so get your camera ready beforehand and then just stake out some wild flowers and wait. Holman&#8217;s not a good winter hike unless you&#8217;re comfortable navigating steep hills in hip waders: lotsa mud. There is no parking at the trailhead, but the Birch Trail parking area just a hundred feet up the hill has more than enough room. Due to its slightly southern position on the hill and open under story, Holman Lane collects a lot of heat from the sun and isn&#8217;t a good choice to escape a sweltering summer afternoon.

I&#8217;ve already done the south half of it a dozen times, in every season, from NW Thurman Street to NW Saltzman Road. It&#8217;s pleasant but eternally crowded; summer weekends are practically a parade. However, about three miles in, at Firelane 1, most people turn around and it&#8217;s nothing but you and the hardcore runners and mountain bikers from there on out. That spot also heralds Leif Erikson&#8217;s swift lurch higher and deeper into the forest, away from the industrial sights and smells of Highway 30, so the ambiance is sweeter on just about every level. Both ends of the road have convenient trash cans, doggie pick up bag dispensers, and seasonal Port-a-potty&#8217;s in the summer. The south end has a spigot for water.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1060810-032.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-821\" title=\"P1060810 032\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1060810-032.jpg?w=640&#038;h=484\" width=\"640\" height=\"484\" /></a></p>\n<p>The section I hadn&#8217;t done yet in one fell swoop is the northern half, so that&#8217;s what I explored today. It&#8217;s got a couple places that turn positively gooey in the winter but other than that, it&#8217;s not bad. About 1.75 miles in, at the intersection with NW Sprinvgille Road, is an open area labeled &#8220;Scout&#8217;s Corner&#8221; by a local artist couple (look about eight feet up the tree to the right of the metal map) that honors a Golden Labrador Retriever they used to walk there. A hundred feet past that spot on the right is the Invisible House. <a href=\"http://forestparkconservancy.org/forest-park/park-history.html\">Leif Erikson</a> used to be a real road with houses along it and this concrete stoop is the only remaining evidence (below). I found a fascinating collection of <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/opbphotos/5033443513/in/photostream/\">historical photos</a> that review the opening of Leif Erikson, the creation of the firelanes, and the fire that made them necessary.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1060780-002.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-820\" title=\"P1060780 002\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/p1060780-002.jpg?w=640&#038;h=480\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a></p>\n<p>The intersection with NW Saltzman Road is little open area that has a picnic table to lunch at or collapse upon.

Most of these roads are still in good condition, with much of their gravel intact, others have been reduced by time and nature to meandering dirt ruts.

Pacific Blackberry (left) differs from the ubiquitous Himalaya Blackberry in that it is a lower, smaller plant with a more slender, blueish cane and far less deadly thorns. The fruit has a subtler flavor than the Himalaya with less of a sweet, winey tang. Lots of open space between the forest floor and upper canopy lends a cathedral feel to Firelane 2 in spots.

It&#8217;s easy to access from NW Skyline Boulevard if you turn into the community called Thunder Crest and continue to the end of the paved drive.\u00a0There is no parking, as a very sternly worded sign at the gate attests, but you can leave your vehicle outside the entrance of the <a href=\"http://www.skylinememorialgardens.com/dm20/en_US/locations/24/2433/directions.page?\">Skyline Memorial Gardens</a> just up the road north of there. Firelane 3 is relatively straight (below) and just under a mile long, hooking up with Maple Trail a mere 15 feet before Leif Erikson Road.

If you want the jungle experience, this is your firelane. It&#8217;s so socked in with Himalaya Blackberry and Thimbleberry that I was wishing for a machete by the time I got to the intersection with Maple Trail. I recommend taking a sheep dip in Deet before striking out on this one. If you continue down Firelane 4 and take the left route up the hill, you&#8217;ll come to a nice look out under a large Doug fir with a low skirt that provides shade from the sun like a circus tent.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/p9237125-007.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-989\" title=\"OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/p9237125-007.jpg?w=640&#038;h=480\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>8-28-11 Firelane #5</strong> 455&#8242; elevation gain, 2.4 miles RT</p>\n<p>Firelane 5 is another popular one with bikers, mostly because it originates in the NW Saltzman Road parking lot, providing easy access for the incoming hordes. It winds back and forth on an incline less steep than other firelanes and launches onto a couple tangents. The first tangent leads to a small open field at one end and a &#8220;secret&#8221; trail looping back onto NW Saltzman Road at the other, a trail that seems a little too wide and pounded down to be a true secret (below).<a href=\"http://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/p8286933-014.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-872\" title=\"OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/p8286933-014.jpg?w=640&#038;h=480\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a> The second tangent literally leads nowhere, but it&#8217;s a soothing, unpopulated nowhere with openness and sunshine. Though not indicated on the map, Firelane 5 does in fact connect with Leif Erikson Road and a bizarre structure sits at the junction: a strange pair of small, moisture-sealed buildings upholstered in moss (below). <a href=\"http://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/p8286927-008.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-873\" title=\"OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/p8286927-008.jpg?w=640&#038;h=825\" width=\"640\" height=\"825\" /></a><a href=\"http://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/p8286925-006.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-874\" title=\"OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/p8286925-006.jpg?w=300&#038;h=226\" width=\"300\" height=\"226\" /></a>An enigmatic bumper sticker decorates one of them, keeping Portland weird.

(<a href=\"http://www.paulnoll.com/Oregon/Wildflower/plant-Nettle-Stinging.html\">Stinging Nettle</a> is the spitting image of Lemon Balm to the untrained eye, so don&#8217;t grab anything and smell it unless you&#8217;re absolutely sure.) The very last five hundred feet or so of road is an obvious cutbank into basalt cliffs and has remnants of low concrete posts where a wooden safety railing used to be. Thanks for walking part of the way and picking blackberries with me, Walter, you are a fantastic conversationalist and hiking partner!</p>\n<p><strong>8-18-11 Firelane #8</strong>\u00a030&#8242; elevation gain, 0.4 miles RT (Foot traffic only)<a href=\"http://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/p8186837-003.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-841\" title=\"OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/p8186837-003.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\n<p>The shortest and sweetest firelane in all of Forest Park also seems to have the most slugs&#8211;it&#8217;s like a slug roundup. The flanks of this quiet, out of the way trail are blanketed with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolmiea\">Piggyback Plant</a> (right), the most I&#8217;ve seen anywhere. It meanders from an access gate 0.1 mile above the Wildwood Trail parking lot on NW Germantown Road down to an obvious intersection with Wildwood Trail and a burbling creek.<a href=\"http://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/p8186840-006.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-842\" title=\"OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/p8186840-006.jpg?w=640&#038;h=480\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a> <strong>8-18-11 Firelane #9</strong>\u00a0430&#8242; elevation gain, 1.3 miles RT (Foot traffic only)</p>\n<p>This one is interesting. It starts directly across NW Germantown Road from the Leif Erikson parking lot, rolls through a few open, mowed meadows that make you pine for a lawn chair and a tall glass of iced tea, dips down a long, steep ramp of a hill lined with Red Huckleberries, and comes to rest at a sharp turn around an old concrete reservoir that nature is elegantly returning to its original wild state (below). At this point, there are two choices. If you turn left and proceed through a couple concrete barricades on a deceptively well traveled path you&#8217;ll swiftly come to an incline so steep that only Crampons could ever get a purchase. It seems to lead down to a creek drainage but I wasn&#8217;t in the mood for injury, so I took door number two and turned right onto a paved road that drops you at the intersection of NW Wilark and NW Mackay Avenues. There\u00a0were For Sale signs along this road when I was there so it may look different in the near future. There is also a boulder with a plaque declaring that &#8220;You are standing in <a href=\"http://www.portlandonline.com/parks/finder/index.cfm?action=ViewPark&amp;PropertyID=894\">Clark &amp; Wilson Park</a>,&#8221; a park within a park that resulted when Forest Park was created around it many years after the original gift of 18 acres was bequeathed by O.M. Clark of Clark &amp; Wilson Lumber Company. Not sure how the For Sale signs fit into that.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/p8186847-013.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-840\" title=\"OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/p8186847-013.jpg?w=640&#038;h=480\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>8-30-11 Firelane #10</strong> 790&#8242; elevation gain, 3+ miles RT</p>\n<p>Firelane 10 is probably the most accessible firelane in all of Forest Park, with three points of entry. It starts just up NW Germantown Road from the Leif Erikson parking lot with its own pull out space for a dozen vehicles along the road. The other end starts right off the NW Newton Road parking lot which can accommodate even more. Somewhere in the middle is a junction with Linnton Trail that takes you right down to a route 16 bus stop on the Columbia Highway. But that&#8217;s not why I love it. It&#8217;s the preponderance of old growth firs with huge barrel trunks that make this route memorable (below). The largest collection of these impressive giants is between the NW Germantown Road gate and the creek, you can&#8217;t miss &#8216;em. They kind of stand out. Another nice feature of Firelane 10 is a small loop close to the NW Newton Road access that gives you an alternative route. It has a large blow down that stops bikers in their tracks, so the road is pretty quiet.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/p8306976-021.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-891\" title=\"OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/p8306976-021.jpg?w=640&#038;h=495\" width=\"640\" height=\"495\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>8-31-11 Firelane #12</strong> 390&#8242; elevation gain, 3 miles RT</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/p9047002-015.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-901\" title=\"OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/p9047002-015.jpg?w=300&#038;h=67\" width=\"300\" height=\"67\" /></a>This firelane has the most gentle incline of all, save a few short drops.

There is a depressing lack of parking in the confusing neighborhood (don&#8217;t believe the Thomas Guide for a second&#8211;stick to Google Maps), however a few pull outs can be claimed if you arrive early and hunt long. But beware, the gate is ferociously guarded by two loud mini-dogs and one fierce predator:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/p9047017-030close-up.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-904\" title=\"OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/p9047017-030close-up.jpg?w=640&#038;h=200\" width=\"640\" height=\"200\" /></a></p>\n<p>Okay, so maybe fierce isn&#8217;t quite the word. <em>Persistent</em> is more like it, especially as regards head scratching and tummy rubbing.

It&#8217;s also the straightest firelane until you get to a tiny spur called 13A that leads you one hill over under said power lines. If you stand at the terminus of Firelane 13 and your buddy goes to the end of 13A, you can wave to each other and take simultaneous portrait photos. I prefer 13, though, because you get a nice peek at the new <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauvie_Island_Bridge\">Sauvie Island Bridge</a> (below).\u00a0This is the sole firelane that is a total dead end geographically; it only leads to those power lines and back to it&#8217;s humble beginnings at BPA Road, it&#8217;s not a thru street.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/p9046992-005.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-899\" title=\"OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/p9046992-005.jpg?w=640&#038;h=475\" width=\"640\" height=\"475\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>8-28-11 Firelane #15</strong> 340&#8242; elevation gain, 2.7 miles RT</p>\n<p>This delightful route is now officially my favorite stroll in all of Forest Park.

Many more trails exist than the 2011 &#8220;Hiking and Running Guide to Forest Park&#8221; map shows because quite a few have been added since then. (The All Trails Challenge webpage of the Forest Park Conservancy used to have a\u00a0comprehensive list\u00a0of trails with a brief description of insertion points for each one but it seems to have mysteriously disappeared.)</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve arranged the trails here from north to south, rural to urban, respectively, as they appear\u00a0in the park. In a nutshell, I can tell you that if you want a quiet hike of sublime serenity, your odds are better if you stick to the trails north of Firelane 1. That seems to be the cut off line for the mobs of frenzied trail runners and most of their organized races. There&#8217;s less noise pollution from the city traffic up there, too. A good rule of thumb is that any trail whose dirt section is wider than 18&#8243; is a popular one and is likely to be an oozing mud pit in the wet winter months. Narrower, overgrown routes will deliver a more natural forest experience.</p>\n<p>The Tao of Slug<a href=\"http://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/p9257172-024.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1001\" title=\"OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA\" src=\"https://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/p9257172-024.jpg?w=640&#038;h=480\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a> <strong>6-25-11 to 7-20-11 Wildwood Trail </strong>5,160&#8242; elevation gain, 60.32 miles RT</p>\n<p>This is the longest and most varied route in all of Forest Park, spanning it&#8217;s entire length from north to south.

It&#8217;s fairly nondescript and had a few impressive blowdowns across it while I was there but it was nice and quiet.<a href=\"http://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/p8306963-008.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-970\" title=\"OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA\" src=\"https://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/p8306963-008.jpg?w=640&#038;h=474\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"474\" /></a> <strong>8-30-11 Linnton Trail </strong>\u00a0420&#8242; elevation gain,\u00a01.16 miles RT</p>\n<p>At the very bottom of Firelane 10 is the top of Linnton Trail, which will lead you down a veritable ladder of tiny switchbacks to a creek, a bridge, and a Y junction right after that (above).

Below Leif Erikson, it opens up into full-on cathedral ceilings of Vine Maple and makes elegant, sweeping loops around ridges and drainages (above).\u00a0Be advised: the &#8220;Hiking and Running Guide to Forest Park&#8221; is wrong. It shows Ridge Trail jogging to the right where it crosses Wildwood but here it crosses directly. It shows Ridge Trail crossing Leif Erikson directly but it actually jogs left (north) before doing so. <a href=\"http://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/p9177084-022.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-965\" title=\"OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA\" src=\"https://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/p9177084-022.jpg?w=300&#038;h=228\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"228\" /></a></p>\n<p>The dirty part comes near the bottom where multiple filthy\u00a0user trails strike off into the woods from Ridge Trail. Firelane 7 and Waterline Road may have transient camps, but Ridge Trail has a transient <em>metropolis</em>. I stopped counting after I reached nine camps. Yes, you read that right, and all of them are carpeted with\u00a0garbage, debris, and human refuse. The signs close to the bottom of Ridge Trail (where it makes a Y into\u00a0two separate insertion points along Bridge Road) encourage you to make a right and I concur: most of the camps are to the left, but so is a spectacular view of the St. John&#8217;s Bridge (above left). This left route makes one switchback and sends you to a bridge that lifts Bridge Road over a deep creek gulch and private home. However, if you turn right at the signs instead, you won&#8217;t miss out. When you see a well-constructed little wooden bridge up ahead, get your camera ready because the St. John&#8217;s Bridge has more than one good side (below). <a href=\"http://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/p9177081-019.jpg\"><img title=\"OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA\" src=\"https://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/p9177081-019.jpg?w=640&#038;h=478\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"478\" /></a>\u00a0<a href=\"http://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/p9177086-024.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-967\" title=\"OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA\" src=\"https://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/p9177086-024.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>The end of Ridge Trail is actually those concrete stairs with the metal railings that you&#8217;ve probably passed on Bridge Road and wondered about (right). The sidewalk there leads to route 16 bus stops on Highway 30. Atop the concrete wall is a disintegrating patio with evidence of what might have been a viewing area for the St. John&#8217;s Bridge at one time. But trees grow and views disappear.</p>\n<p><strong>9-29-11 Wiregate Trail</strong> 180&#8242; elevation gain, 0.62 miles RT</p>\n<p>The only quick way to get to Wiregate Trail is to take Trillium Trail down to Wildwood Trail from the Springville Road parking area&#8211;so you can add <em>that</em> bit of incline to Wiregate&#8217;s otherwise benign descent. Wiregate itself is fairly wide on its lower half&#8211;obviously a former road&#8211;but because it hugs a creek so close in such a steep-sided little gully, there&#8217;s a fair amount of year round moisture and the usual accompanying <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stinging_nettle\">Stinging Nettle</a> to contend with. Wiregate drops you off on Leif Erikson at a nice bend at mile marker 7.13 where the selfsame creek opens a bit into a mini-meadow. <strong><a href=\"http://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/p9257169-021.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-1000\" title=\"OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA\" src=\"https://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/p9257169-021.jpg?w=300&#038;h=243\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"243\" /></a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>9-25-11 Quarry Trail </strong>70&#8242; elevation gain, 0.25 miles RT</p>\n<p>You won&#8217;t find Quarry Trail on any map or even Google, it&#8217;s that new. The All Trails Challenge by the Forest Park Conservancy even neglected to list it. But don&#8217;t let that stop you, it&#8217;s worth taking this little connector from Leif Erikson to Maple Trail. It&#8217;s easy to find: at that famous rest spot on Leif Erikson with the picnic table where Saltzman Road passes by, look for the Quarry Trail sign right there in the Himalayan Blackberries. The brambles only last a few yards, then the soft, moist forest takes over and you&#8217;ll enjoy a gentle grade for about a quarter mile.

It crosses two sizable creeks, providing <a href=\"http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2011/3132/\">critters of the aquatic persuasion</a> (above) as well as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_squirrel\">furry sort</a> that chatter aloft (below).<a href=\"http://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/p9257184-036.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-999\" title=\"OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA\" src=\"https://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/p9257184-036.jpg?w=640&#038;h=488\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"488\" /></a> At just over 7 miles long RT Maple Trail gives you a decent workout, too. The best way to reach it is to park at the top of Firelane 2 and head down, taking a left (north) on Wildwood Trail. Just a few hundred feet up from there is Maple Trail. There are five intersections with firelanes, trails, and connectors before Maple concludes at a bend in Leif Erikson (milepost 6.44), so you have plenty of options.

All the trail runners tend to pound along Wildwood, Dogwood, and Wild Cherry, leaving Alder to itself. You can tell this because Alder is a mere 14&#8243; wide as opposed to the broader, eroded track of those popular thoroughfares. It&#8217;s a delightful way to get onto Leif Erikson if you don&#8217;t want to deal with the parking situation on NW Thurman Street, either.

The icing on the cake is the ample parking up on NW 53rd Avenue and the mowed areas there that would look pretty good with a picnic blanket spread out over them. I did witness the odd and rarely seen courting habits of the Forest Park Wheelbarrow (below). Apparently, when the trail crews knock off for the day, the wheelbarrows all get together and do a little canoodling of their own. <a href=\"http://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/p9297220-031.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1014\" title=\"OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA\" src=\"https://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/p9297220-031.jpg?w=640&#038;h=477\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"477\" /></a> <strong>9-30-11 Aspen Trail</strong> 170&#8242; elevation gain, 0.46 miles RT</p>\n<p>Aspen Trail is probably a mystery to anyone who doesn&#8217;t live in the adjacent neighborhood, but it&#8217;s a very handy way to reach Wildwood Trail without having to deal with the hair-pulling parking situation at the end of NW Thurman Street. Here&#8217;s what you do: park as close as you can get to 3418 NW Thurman Street and look for these public stairs on the north side of the street ascending past the maples up into a grove of bamboo (below).<a href=\"http://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/p9307238-015.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1020\" title=\"OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA\" src=\"https://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/p9307238-015.jpg?w=640&#038;h=487\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"487\" /></a> <a href=\"http://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/p9307234-011.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-1021\" title=\"OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA\" src=\"https://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/p9307234-011.jpg?w=300&#038;h=233\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"233\" /></a>In fact, it&#8217;s bamboo all the way up, you&#8217;ll think you&#8217;re in China.

And sometimes it seems as if the entire Portland Metro area is there, getting enchanted. It&#8217;s not a good place for silent meditation but it&#8217;s definitely worth seeing the sheer elegance of Balch Creek, a rare four-season source of watery music and intermittent reflecting pools (above). The trail begins in Upshur Park, which is a clue which street you need to be on to find it. Parking on NW Upshur can be a bear during peak hours but if you park along NW Thurman above it, you can take the stairs down next to the bridge. The initial quarter mile of Lower Macleay Trail is paved to provide access for people with all abilities and leads to a nice little rock-walled patio overlooking the water. After that, the trail becomes a sometimes-gravel-sometimes-dirt dance partner with the creek. You&#8217;re close to the water a lot, so watch your step (below).<a href=\"http://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/p9307251-028.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1023\" title=\"OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA\" src=\"https://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/p9307251-028.jpg?w=640&#038;h=492\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"492\" /></a> <a href=\"http://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/p9307252-029-copy.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-1028\" title=\"OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA\" src=\"https://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/p9307252-029-copy.jpg?w=300&#038;h=239\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"239\" /></a>This little waterfall (above) feeds a deep glassy pool, decorated with ferns and undulating with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutthroat_trout\">Cutthroat trout</a>\u00a0(below).

It does not disappoint: it&#8217;s short, steep, ends right next to a handsome 1940 stone tunnel on Cornell Drive, has plenty of parking there as well as a grassy lawn,\u00a0and it follows a moist drainage the entire way down, ensuring a steady supply of wildlife like giant (but harmless) <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_garden_spider\">cross spiders</a> with 3/4&#8243; abdomens (above left) and ornamental fungi.

Unfortunately, he turned his head just as I snapped the photo below and I did not get another chance. It was worth it. Gary, my ears are still resonating with that Liverpool accent.

There are signs helpfully pointing the way but the trails come together at such nonsensical angles that it plays tricks with the mind, especially at dusk, so don&#8217;t attempt to navigate this one in the dark. Many have lost their minds. On the other hand, since everyone pauses here, it&#8217;s not a bad place to make new acquaintances and pet friendly dogs. Like Macleay, Upper Macleay has an easy incline and an open understory. It cuts a long switchback, making its turn at a Forest Park access at the end of NW Macleay Boulevard, then meeting up again with Wildwood further down the hill. Do not look for parking on NW Macleay Boulevard, you&#8217;ll just waste a lot of gas making 3-point turns.</p>\n<p>Pileated Woodpecker graffiti.<a href=\"http://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/p9257167-019.jpg\"><img title=\"OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA\" src=\"https://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/p9257167-019.jpg?w=640&#038;h=853\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"853\" /></a></p>\n<p>Well, that&#8217;s it, that&#8217;s all of Forest Park. From June to September, I made seven new friends (ten if you count the canines), obliterated a brand new pair of walking shoes, burned fifteen pounds, and brought a favorite pair of Columbia hiking pants dangerously close to the end of their life. I saw the forest in the morning, afternoon, and evening in sweltering heat, chilly fall air,\u00a0dripping humidity, and intermittent rain. I feasted on wood sorrel, red huckleberries, two kinds of blackberries, Thimbleberries, and Oregon Grape. I hiked upwards of 200 miles when you account for the extra stretches of access trails and the fact that most of the journeys were round trips. I learned a lot of history about the area and finally made one-time contact with a warm body at the honorable Forest Park Conservancy, albeit never again. I slept better at night than I have in years. And I did all of this completely unaware that a program called the<a href=\"http://www.forestparkconservancy.org/portland-hiking-trails/all-trails-challenge.html\"> All Trails Challenge</a> was running simultaneously with my personal expedition. (I thought of it first, so neener, neener.)</p>\n<p>Now, if anybody stops me in Forest Park and asks if I know where a trail goes, I can proudly reply, &#8220;Hell, yeah.&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>Happy</em> (slug) <em>trails to you, until we meet again&#8230;.<a href=\"http://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/p9307267-044.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1039\" title=\"OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA\" src=\"https://allthoughtsworkoutdoors.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/p9307267-044.jpg?w=640&#038;h=490\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"490\" /></a></em></p>\n", "post_id": 885, "location": false, "date": "09-30-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}], "edges": [{"data": [16950372, 14362478, 16950372, 14362478, 16950372, 11611965, 14362478, 11611965, 14362478, 47953690, 8088536, 14362478, 8088536, 14362478, 8088536, 14362478, 24197797, 26026064, 35113172, 14362478, 14362478, 35113172, 26026064, 14362478, 52020648, 14362478, 52020648, 14362478, 27209308, 14362478, 39515937, 14362478, 39515937, 14362478, 23386704, 14362478, 4632688, 14362478, 12794513, 14362478, 69169227, 14362478, 6370594, 14362478, 12794513, 14362478, 42806376, 14362478, 42806376, 14362478, 30486212, 41708382, 14362478, 41708382, 14362478, 41708382, 14362478, 30399857, 14362478, 0, 14362478, 331528, 14362478, 0, 14362478, 62071260, 14362478, 63397250, 14362478, 30399857, 14362478, 62071260, 14362478, 0, 14362478, 30399857, 14362478, 0, 14362478, 63547428, 14362478, 0, 14362478, 8088536, 14362478, 0, 0, 14362478, 49481215, 0, 14362478, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 14362478, 14362478, 0, 0, 14362478, 0, 14362478, 0, 14362478, 0, 14362478, 0, 0, 0, 0], "type": "comment", "service": "wordpress"}, {"data": [8088536, 11611965, 16950372, 25947437, 26026064, 33321483, 39639100, 43766329, 45444092, 49766795, 74526472, 176734, 331528, 946524, 1701114, 3068323, 5553031, 6370594, 7815508, 9325693, 9365062, 10423310, 12794513, 14696277, 14787880, 15316451, 17016331, 19051989, 23386704, 24652093, 26631097, 29511170, 30399857, 30486212, 33424650, 36143423, 38494583, 39515937, 41708382, 42806376, 44054774, 45311648, 46944814, 49157477, 52020648, 52816644, 59569007, 62071260, 63397250, 63535591, 66343062, 68220110, 69169227, 69620012, 70227740, 71860041, 74526472, 176734, 331528, 946524, 1701114, 3068323, 5553031, 6370594, 7815508, 9325693, 9365062, 10423310, 12794513, 14696277, 14787880, 15316451, 17016331, 19051989, 23386704, 24652093, 26631097, 29511170, 30399857, 30486212, 33424650, 36143423, 38494583, 39515937, 41708382, 42806376, 44054774, 45311648, 46944814, 49157477, 52020648, 52816644, 59569007, 62071260, 63397250, 63535591, 66343062, 68220110, 69169227, 69620012, 70227740, 71860041, 74526472, 176734, 331528, 946524, 1701114, 3068323, 5553031, 6370594, 7815508, 9325693, 9365062, 10423310, 12794513, 14696277, 14787880, 15316451, 17016331, 19051989, 23386704, 24652093, 26631097, 29511170, 30399857, 30486212, 33424650, 36143423, 38494583, 39515937, 41708382, 42806376, 44054774, 45311648, 46944814, 49157477, 52020648, 52816644, 59569007, 62071260, 63397250, 63535591, 66343062, 68220110, 69169227, 69620012, 70227740, 71860041, 74526472, 8088536, 24026646, 30399857, 40973071, 63397250, 70111715, 8088536, 8551886, 11625517, 14362478, 26214868, 53097981, 55460092, 4855913, 8088536, 8432345, 8551886, 10423310, 23386704, 30399857, 30440177, 35259221, 40727845, 42382952, 46435799, 46602817, 50945432, 51049631, 53368157, 57903323, 60688897, 63397250, 49481215, 26631097, 72338321, 8088536, 40298560], "type": "like", "service": "wordpress"}], "metadata": {"services": [{"username": "allthoughtswork", "display_name": "allthoughtswork", "service": "wordpress", "service_url": "https://wordpress.com/", "location": false, "service_id": 14362478, "profile_url": "http://en.gravatar.com/allthoughtswork"}]}}

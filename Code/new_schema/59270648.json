I was crying of course!! </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:'Calibri', 'sans-serif';\">It was funny because I did not want her to see the tears in my ears. I kept avoiding her in the office.

He&#8217;s more apt to cry than my mother.</p>\n<p>But sometimes Dad does have a temper and lashes out in anger.</p>\n<p>He says things that hurt but is not afraid to apologize.</p>\n<p>One example I remember was as a child. He was never a disciplinarian.\u00a0 But I remember getting spanked once in awhile.</p>\n<p>One time when I was about eight or nine I got in trouble. He spanked me. I screamed that I hated him. Dad said I would regret those words and that I could not take them back.</p>\n<p>I ran to my room and barricaded the door. He pushed open the door open and hugged me. He held me for a few moments and through my tears told me he was sorry and that he loved me.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It is funny how he could say one thing in one moment and take it back.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This was not the only time he did this. I always knew in my heart he loved and adored me.</p>\n<p>There always times of great happiness.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As a child we purchased one of those old radios for his birthday. It was pretty simple but it worked. I think he still has it. When the antenna fell off he put a coat hanger on it.\u00a0 The radio would play old tunes in the garage while he danced and sang to the lyrics.</p>\n<p>Often when it would rain he grab a bar of soap, go outside and say he was taking a shower.\u00a0 Or gather change and run around the corner to get a treat like ice cream or chocolate for all of us. On hot summer nights put the television on the porch so we could cool off or run around with us spraying the hose.</p>\n<p>These were great times.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I would also say Dad is a faithful and loyal person. He is never late and always remembers your birthday.</p>\n<p>My mother is the absolute love of his life. One moment Mom and Dad will be fighting and in the next he they would be the best of friends.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I love reading the Valentine&#8217;s Day cards he gives her as he always put a personal little note in it to her.\u00a0 I still see those notes and it makes me tear up every time.</p>\n<p>The best thing that ever happened with our relationship is the birth of my son.\u00a0 I always say my son is the apple of his eye.\u00a0 After my son was born he would sit there for hours holding him and loving him.\u00a0 Often his eyes welled up with tears. I would see him kiss his head and squeeze him tight.</p>\n<p>Things he still does now!</p>\n<p>Touching moments I will never forget.</p>\n<p>If there was one thing I think he regretted was not having a better job or making a lot of money.\u00a0 He wanted to give us his all and make sure our needs were met.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Truthfully my Dad did give us his all.\u00a0 He went to work everyday, took care of his kids, did laundry and dishes, treated my mother as an equal and with respect.</p>\n<p>Dad is always thoughtful and kind and loves to sing, laugh and rejoice in life with others.</p>\n<p>As I grow older I tend to ignore the things he does which drives me crazy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Instead I celebrate my Dad&#8217;s life.</p>\n<p>I regret those words I said as I child.</p>\n<p>I understand him.</p>\n<p>My dad is not a man of means but one of substance and is filled with an undeniable purpose and vigor for life.</p>\n<p>He possesses undying love and affection for his family.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A true gift to my life!!!</p>\n<p>I think I got some ideas for the speech.</p>\n<p>Thanks for listening!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>\n<p>A friend always</p>\n<p>Kim</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alwaysthinkingimfat.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/man-of-means1.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image\" id=\"i-1748\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://alwaysthinkingimfat.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/man-of-means1.jpg?w=650\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 1749, "location": false, "date": "02-09-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["motivational"], "text": "<p>Well my weekend did not start out good but it ended great.

I made this decision for me. Especially since the medication can affect my high blood pressure.\u00a0 I have learned that a pill can not solve your problems.\u00a0 In order to lose weight you must change your habits and seek support.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I have embraced a healthier lifestyle. One way is by exercising 5 &#8211; 6 days a week.\u00a0 One of my favorite ways is to do a fitness walk. Every session I push myself towards new levels of fitness.</p>\n<p>Exercise has been the best drug for me.\u00a0 It raises my spirits and keeps me strong,\u00a0 When I workout I see improvement and feel so much better.</p>\n<p>I also make sure my diet includes fruits and vegetables. I watch the foods I eat.\u00a0 Weight watchers has been great and gives me structure. I don&#8217;t think I would have gotten this far without it.</p>\n<p>Also I want to let you know I have started a blog.\u00a0 I share my thoughts and feelings with others and get such wonderful support and feedback.\u00a0 I try to give others encouragement.\u00a0 I have met people from all over having the same struggles with their weight.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So I hope you notice the one thing I have not written about which is the amount of pounds I have lost.\u00a0 I have found out this is not as important.\u00a0 I need to focus on myself and the things I can do to lead a healthier life.\u00a0 If I follow this plan I can lose weight.</p>\n<p>I remember that first appointment when I wept about my weight.\u00a0 I had never really touched the surface of what was happening on the inside because all I cared about was the outside.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Weight loss involves change and lots of effort.\u00a0 It is intertwined among the many facets of your life and can not be solved by working on one thing in your life. You must accept yourself and make better decisions.\u00a0 Leave your past behind and see what has gotten you to this point.\u00a0 I will need to follow this plan for the rest of my life.</p>\n<p>I want to say you are truly kind and compassionate!

The new position was more money and responsibility. Two things I was craving for in life.</p>\n<p>In the first week I began to look at different processes. I had questions the way people were completing job tasks.</p>\n<p>In hindsight maybe I should not have been so headstrong but it is hard to turn off a creative mind.</p>\n<p>I also met a lady who was so happy I had started at this job and that I would be her new supervisor.\u00a0 She worked under the director of the department that had hired me.\u00a0 I noticed she was often nervous.\u00a0 She would wring her hands quite often and her eyes were wide and anxious.</p>\n<p>In my haste I was too blinded by my quest for success to see the trouble ahead.</p>\n<p>It was the end of the first week and there was a meeting with director,\u00a0 the nervous lady and me.\u00a0 We went in and the door closed.</p>\n<p>It turned into one of the worst situations of my life.</p>\n<p>The director turned her ire on the nervous lady. Berating and verbally assaulting her before my eyes.</p>\n<p>&#8221; I take how long it takes me to do something and I times it by two.\u00a0 So I expect you to get it together or else!.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I was in total shock and not able to say one word.\u00a0 Then the nervous lady left the room.</p>\n<p>She turned her anger on me.</p>\n<p>&#8221; I don&#8217;t know what you know or what you don&#8217;t know but this is how it is and you better get it straight.&#8221;</p>\n<p>My face turned red. I sat listening and not believing her unprofessional tone and manner.</p>\n<p>I guess one of the ladies did not appreciate me looking at their work and giving her ideas so she went crying to the director.</p>\n<p>I left her office shell shocked and in disbelief.\u00a0 In my office I locked the door and sobbed.</p>\n<p>I just had ruined my life.</p>\n<p>So I packed up and left that day.</p>\n<p>The aftermath of this incident was falling into a severe depression.\u00a0 I could not eat, drink, move or feel.\u00a0 The feelings of failure engulfed me. I could not find solace in one thing of my life.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s funny how the people that truly love you sometimes take over.\u00a0 My mother rallied to my side.\u00a0 She held my hand but also kicked my but when I needed.\u00a0 My sisters would hold me, take care of house, feed me and take me to my doctor appointments.</p>\n<p>I would sit in my husband&#8217;s arms for hours and cry.</p>\n<p>One of the worst nights my mom slept over.\u00a0 My husband worked the night shift and could not take another day off.\u00a0 I sat there weeping the entire night.</p>\n<p>As the tears flowed I could not let go of my feelings of failure and self loathing.</p>\n<p>I was in the bathroom and I saw the medicine cabinet.</p>\n<p>The voices chimed in my head.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Who would miss me? I am a nothing, a failure, I can&#8217;t do anything right.</strong></em></p>\n<p>I touched the door but I could not open it.</p>\n<p>I walked out to the couch and saw my mother.\u00a0 This beautiful woman, had given me life, nurtured me from a baby and had always been with me every moment was clutching a pillow like she would have been me.\u00a0 She had been so sick with worry and fear.</p>\n<p>I decided I needed to go to bed.</p>\n<p>It was a slow trip out of the abyss.\u00a0 The small steps to find myself again and learn to love life.</p>\n<p>I laugh at people that complain compassion is dead.\u00a0 It lives and breathes so fully in our lives yet most people choose to overlook it.\u00a0 I do not.</p>\n<p>At one appointment I broke down hysterical in sobs in front of the doctor.\u00a0 He stopped talking,\u00a0 sat down beside me and put his arm around me.</p>\n<p>These moments of love and support brought me back to life and made me a better person.</p>\n<p>I even got a card from the nervous lady.\u00a0 She had found a new job as well.</p>\n<p>Often after I take a shower I look at my face in mirror on the medicine cabinet.</p>\n<p>I look at the person I have become. The things I have experienced. The wonderful life events I would have missed. The happiness I have to be here.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Another day life takes another turn.</strong></em>\u00a0 <em><strong>I would not miss it for anything!!!!</strong></em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alwaysthinkingimfat.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/sketchguru_20140218142826.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2563\" alt=\"SketchGuru_20140218142826\" src=\"https://alwaysthinkingimfat.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/sketchguru_20140218142826.jpg?w=300&#038;h=300\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 2510, "location": false, "date": "02-18-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>So many times I sit and think about food and the meanings of hunger. </p>\n<h2>hun\u00b7ger</h2>\n<p><span class=\"main-fl\"><em>noun</em></span> <span class=\"pr\">\\<span class=\"unicode\">\u02c8</span>h\u0259\u014b-g\u0259r\\</span></p>\n<div class=\"ld_on_collegiate\">\n<p>: a very great need for food : a severe lack of food</p>\n<p>: an uncomfortable feeling in your stomach that is caused by the need for food</p>\n<p class=\"bottom_entry\">: a strong desire : a strong desire <em>for</em> something or <em>to do</em> something (Merriam Webster Dictionary)</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ld_on_collegiate\">It appears there are three different meaning to the word.

I cried every minute and wanted desperately to go home.\u00a0 It took a couple of weeks and I got into a routine.</p>\n<p>I had always been sedentary so I had to walk everywhere. The pounds began to shed off. People began to notice me and I was fitting into clothes 3-4 sizes smaller.</p>\n<p>The only problem was I was not eating. I would eat a bagel and fruit in the morning and then not eat anything else. I was so angry and the only thing that made me feel better was being skinnier. At the college infirmary the doctor noticed I had lost about 20 pounds in a matter of weeks. He asked me what was going on. I just said I had been dieting. He suggested I seek help. I ignored him. It kept getting worse.</p>\n<p>It was around this time I started binging and purging. I can honestly say it was one of the worst feelings in the world. But I wanted to eat and I needed to get skinner. I found myself tired and listless. My hair didn&#8217;t have the same shine and my complexion was not as clear.</p>\n<p>Every compliment I received drove me to do it more. I had lost over 90 pounds and was fitting into clothes I had never imagined. It was one big rush with a huge letdown.</p>\n<p>By the second semester I had reached my lowest point. One of my relatives found out what I was doing and told my mother. It is funny how your mother can bring you back to reality. She implored me to stop and seek help.</p>\n<p>Also during a doctor visit some lab tests revealed an excess of ketones in my urine sample. The doctor sat across from me and said I was killing myself. She encouraged me to look myself. The doctor mentioned my hair which was dry and brittle.\u00a0 For the next couple of minutes she rattled over the health implications of this condition. I became terrified!!</p>\n<p>I did seek help but it took some time. My life turned around. But I did gain weight back but I lived with it. I needed to lose the right way and to keep myself grounded.</p>\n<p>The urge has never left me. I fight it every time I overeat. I tell myself how stupid and fat I am. That I will never lose weight. I then hear a voice that says <em><strong>&#8220;Stop it!&#8221;\u00a0</strong></em> The voice guides me to let go of these feelings and lets me make peace with myself.</p>\n<p>There are two things I would like to say:</p>\n<p><em><strong>Seek help and guidance for any problems with weight that may jeopardize your health and well being.</strong> </em></p>\n<p><em><strong>I implore everyone to lose weight the right way!!!</strong></em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n", "post_id": 282, "location": false, "date": "01-04-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>Yesterday I found one of my friends is in the hospital and is very sick.\u00a0 There is a chance she may not make it.</p>\n<p>I hope God hears me on this one!!</p>\n<p>Her name is Florence but she goes by Flossie.\u00a0 As a friend she nurtures and loves you.\u00a0 Stands beside you and roots for you.\u00a0 Her belief in God has never waned even with all the sickness she had had in the past couple of years.</p>\n<p>I remember the times we danced in the bathroom.\u00a0 Laughed at silly things.

interesting!<br />\nIt&#8217;s about being together and making the most of your time!<br />\nI love the National Lampoon&#8217;s Vacation!<br />\nThere are some parts of the movie which make me laugh and laugh!<br />\nI remember the station wagon, the hazards of traveling the open roads and of course the visit to the amusement park!<br />\nOur trip was not too eventful!  We went to Great Escape near Lake George New York.<br />\nI did have a couple of moments!<br />\nOn the water slide I decided to lay back and let myself go as fast as possible.  The next thing I know I hit the water and it goes up my nose.  My nose is burning, I&#8217;m coughing and my sunglasses went flying. I sat up for a moment trying to get my thoughts together.  A young girl lifeguard walks up to me and asks if I was ok!  I nodded my head, found my sunglasses on the other side of the pool.<br />\nI decided I needed to stay away from the water slides!<br />\nThe next day I was sitting on a lounger getting some sun.  I noticed these large brown spots going up my white legs.  I began to panic a little bit!! Did I get like a fungus infection from the water? I touched the spots and it felt sticky!  I remembered earlier I spilled a large travel mug of root beet at the concession stand all over me and a few other people.  The spots were root beer that had dried on my legs!  I laughed and then felt relieved!<br />\nSo our little vacation was fun but not too eventful!!

You can hear and feel the passion and fervency of the people. </p>\n<p>If we continue to try and break these bonds there will be nothing left for the future generations.  Instead we must preserve the American ideals, culture and history.  Bring about changes to nurture our spirit and solidify our foundations.  </p>\n<p>For we can only experience the past if we present it to the future.  </p>\n<p>Our country is a unique anomaly.  Thousands of people from distinct and varied cultures cohabitating and celebrating the American way.  We should not be remiss in our diligence to laud our special qualities! </p>\n<p> I&#8217;m an American Girl with her own unique perspective.

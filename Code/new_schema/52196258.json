For good to exist, bad must also exist. If bad doesn&#8217;t co exist, then good cannot exist because there would be nothing to compare it to to give it value. It would just be neutral. Therefore for one to exist, the other must also be in existence.</p>\n<div>This reminds me of a quote from Nicholas Sparks&#8217;s &#8216;A Walk to Remember&#8217; \u00a0&#8216;Jamie: Without suffering there would be no compassion.&#8217;\u00a0\n<div>If suffering did not exist there would be no one to be compassionate to. In life if bad things don&#8217;t happen then we wouldn&#8217;t know the value of good and happy moments. Days would past, time would fly and we would never get a glimpse of how truly beautiful life could be with happy moments and good times; it would all simple be neutral or &#8216;normal&#8217;.\u00a0</div>\n<div>^_^ This post was inspired by my friend S.D. who pointed out the fact to me, that if bad does not exist then good cannot exist! :D\u00a0</div>\n</div>\n", "post_id": 100, "location": false, "date": "08-05-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>Butterflies are my favourite creature and this is not due to their beautiful appearance alone; this is due to their nature.Butterflies usually originates from caterpillars who spend this time span feeding.

In this time frame a lot has happened and I don&#8217;t think my blog space will allow me to share every detail but I will nevertheless attempt to summarize these events quite nicely and short:</p>\n<p>I wondered what the purpose was of bad things happening to good people. I spent endless days speculating that if I was a bad person and if this was part of the bargain that bad people had to endure. I came to realise that it was essential for growth to occur. I learnt that if I was to move on to a stage in life that I had to face a trial and learn to deal with it. I learnt that how I dealt with the situation determined if I was a mature individual or if I was still stuck in the child like mind. I was engrossed to decisions if I was to continue filling my heart with pain or to accept the outcomes that life provides and to go through the procedure. I had to grow up. There were some points where I asked myself \u201cWhy should I accept these changes why can\u2019t I be resilient?\u201d That was when I came to terms of dealing with the pain. I didn\u2019t see the point if I was to cry and break everyday. I didn\u2019t want to be depressed. I didn\u2019t have the time to be susceptible to the pain. I had too many expectations to live up to. People relied on me and I relied on myself to keep going.\u00a0 I learnt in that moment, I had to make myself happy, that others couldn\u2019t do it. They could be the source but not the actual will. The will had to come from me. I controlled my feelings. I eventually grew up.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I hope this inspires at least one person to see their purpose and wills <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)</span></p>\n<p>-Kari\u00a0<a href=\"http://aminellie.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/better-today.jpg\"><img id=\"i-286\" class=\"size-full wp-image\" src=\"https://aminellie.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/better-today.jpg?w=226\" alt=\"Image\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 270, "location": false, "date": "04-21-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["EarthDay", "recycling", "It'sSimpleReally", "environment", "protection", "Earth"], "text": "<p><strong>&#8216;Only when the last tree has died and the last river been poisoned and the last fish been caught will we realize we cannot eat money&#8217;</strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://aminellie.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/dsc05063.jpg\"><img id=\"i-334\" class=\"size-full wp-image aligncenter\" src=\"https://aminellie.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/dsc05063.jpg?w=470\" alt=\"Image\" /></a></strong></p>\n<p>Happy Earth Day!! (even though it&#8217;s a little late) <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)</span></p>\n<p>However, I think that Earth day should be considered as everyday because we live on Earth everyday. Some people may underestimate the impact that our simple everyday actions can have on the planet. Recycling may seem like a waste of time and it&#8217;s better to purchase new than to reuse the old stuff&#8230;but seriously guys, one day we will use out all of the Earth&#8217;s natural resources and and pollute the environment so much that the entire Earth becomes a toxic waste dump. We will only then know the true value of the resources we had. Also, while simple actions may seem as though it can cause no harm, a build up of these simplicities can definitely lead to to a bigger issue and have a huge and detrimental impact on the environment. So let&#8217;s try to protect our lovely planet by appreciating the wonderful natural resources and let us try to not contaminate them and destroy.</p>\n<p>*If you think you do not have a big enough impact on this planet to care&#8230;Here&#8217;s a list of simple actions that are harmful to the environment:</p>\n<p>- purchasing bottles water very often and throwing away the bottles because they usually end up in landfill</p>\n<p>-simple littering on the streets, in a drain, on a savannah or anywhere possible because the garbage would evetually end up clogging the drains and causing floodings</p>\n<p>-wasting water in ways such as leaving the tap on while you brush your teeth, soap your skin and shampoo your hair</p>\n<p>-leaving on the lights or anything that uses electricity because you are wasting very valuable energy which usually result in cutting down trees to make more energy</p>\n<p>- cutting down a tree or plants that could have prevented</p>\n<p>- using chemical fertilizers and pesticides because after they soak into the soil, they run off into the drains, rivers and seas</p>\n<p>-breaking of coral reefs to keep as souvenirs</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>*But you think these are a part of everyday life and you need them for survival? Here are some ways you can alter you habits and contribute to the protection and preservation of the environment:</p>\n<p>-having one refillable water bottle so you don&#8217;t dump hundreds of water bottles every year</p>\n<p>-wait until you reach home to throw your garbage away or use a public bin&#8230;if you&#8217;re at the beach carry a garbage bag and take it home</p>\n<p>-close the pipes while brushing your teeth and shampooing hair and soaping your skin</p>\n<p>-turn of lights, fan, or unnecessary electrical items when not in use</p>\n<p>-plant a tree or plants if you have a backyard or any piece of dirt that could sustain a plant</p>\n<p>-use environmentally friendly ways to prevents pests</p>\n<p>-take a picture of coral reefs but do not break them of, they are vital for ocean life</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So it&#8217;s not so hard to just recycle a little or stop yourself contributing to unnecessary harmful environmental acts. In fact most negative environmental issues are caused for humans. YOU and I can stop this by starting with ourselves to make a difference. We can make a change!</p>\n<p>*REDUCE* REUSE* RECYCLE* \u00a0:D <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-bigsmile' title=':D'>:D</span> <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)</span> ^_^</p>\n", "post_id": 291, "location": false, "date": "04-22-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Miracles", "life", "blessings", "tiny"], "text": "<p><img class=\"size-full\" src=\"https://aminellie.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/1081_519131148105944_522701083_n.png\" alt=\"Tiny Miracles\" /></p>\n<p>Sometimes we tend to take things for granted.

Think about what miracles that have occurred in your life and what you are very thankful for even though they seem trivial.

The gloomy atmosphere brought with it many annoyed faces as most people stood under bus stop sheds or stayed inside stores and waited to spot a taxi. But not my friends and I. No. We boldly walked out onto sidewalk and decided we will walk home on this Friday evening (without umbrellas). However, don\u2019t get me wrong; we are not brave people. We were worried. We were very worried that the rain would soak us before we reach home. But nevertheless, we continued to walk ourselves home (mainly because we couldn&#8217;t get a taxi). So here we are\u2026walking\u2026with a few people doing the same in front us, when suddenly, thunder roared. Tiny droplets of rain began to drizzle. One of the girls in front spun around and yelled \u2018rain is coming, ruuuunnnnn!\u2019 We all burst out in laughter. It was hilarious! We took off, full speed ahead, running up the sidewalk trying to outrun the\u00a0rain. Obviously we didn\u2019t make it. The rain started\u00a0pouring down on us. But there was nowhere to stop; we had to continue walking through the shower.</p>\n<p>However, we found it quite enjoyable. Even though we were dripping wet, we began making jokes and playing in the rain. We decided that we cannot let a little rain spoil our Friday evening. So we started singing, yelling, laughing and doing all sorts of silly stuff. We did not allow the rain that we worried so badly about to stop us from reaching home on time or enjoying our afternoon. In fact, that was one of the most memorable and exciting times we ever had while heading home. It was the rain that filled the afternoon with such joy and amusement.</p>\n<p>So sometimes in life we spend all day and night worrying about an issue. But it makes no sense. We need to live for today. If a little or a lot of rain begins to pour in our lives, we need to get out there and dance in it! We need to make the best of every situation. Even when we it can be the worst thing that can happen, it can turn around to actually be the best. We could have stayed under a bus stop shed and waited for the rain to pass, but then we would not have had those fun times.</p>\n<p>You need to do that in your life also. Come out from under the bus stop shed and play in the rain. We need to see the best in a situation and make every moment an enjoyable one. Life is not about waiting for the storm to pass, it\u2019s about learning to dance in the rain. Sometimes it\u2019s the times that we fear most that can turn out to be the best times\u2026only if we make it happen.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>((Here&#8217;s part two of Playing in the Rain &#8211;&gt; \u00a0http://aminellie.wordpress.com/2014/04/27/playing-in-the-rain-part-two/ \u00a0&#8230;take a read my dear friends <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)</span> ))</p>\n<p>xoxo <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-heart' title='&lt;3'>&lt;3</span></p>\n", "post_id": 410, "location": false, "date": "04-26-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["lessons", "Trying", "hardships"], "text": "<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-43 aligncenter\" alt=\"images (7)e\" src=\"https://aminellie.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/images-7e.jpg?w=300&#038;h=206\" width=\"300\" height=\"206\" /></p>\n<p>Sometimes we may wonder&#8230; &#8216;<i>why do I have to experience such hard times</i><i>\u00a0in my life?

Whether it is as simple as waking up on time or as heart wrenching as death of a love one; there will never be a day without a challenge. Many of these situations we may be prepared for due to similar issues faced in the past or advice given to us by others. However, a great deal of life\u2019s challenges will pop up so unexpectedly that they can scare the living daylights out of us. Sometimes situations occur but we will be so completely unprepared for them that we will be worried out of our minds. Situations that we are unprepared for will happen but we cannot hide from them. This is not something that can be avoided. We cannot choose if they occur in our lives or not. However we can definitely chose how they affect our lives.</p>\n<p>We can either let them completely disrupt us, or we can continue to go on. \u00a0We can worry about it so much that we spent most of our time worrying.\u00a0 We can search for a solution so much that we spend most of our time searching. We would spend so much time searching for a solution that the situation would have passed without us realizing.\u00a0 But we can\u2019t do that. We can\u2019t let these challenges affect us so badly. We have to continue to go on\u2026through these hard times\u2026through the rain. Even if it seems impossible to endure, we have to hold faith in ourselves and believe we can do it.</p>\n<p>If my friends and I chose to wait until the rain passed, we would have never arrived home on time. If we chose to wait on a taxi, a taxi may have never come. But we chose to walk through the rain even though we had no umbrellas. We were completely unprepared for this task but we had to endure it anyway. We did not let the rain delay our lives, but we continued on as usual.</p>\n<p>This is what you need to do in your life.<em> When the rain falls in your life, you need to walk through the rain and still arrive on time.</em> You can\u2019t let life\u2019s challenges get in your way. You have to get up every day and endure these hard times and never let it disrupt your life. You need to hold on to hope and handle these situations with such courage that you might not even think that you were unprepared.</p>\n<p>So if you are experiencing hard times at this moment, don\u2019t let it consume another moment.

We put ourselves into so many life threatening situations each day. Our simple daily activities can go wrong in many ways. The world is full of obstacles that can result in death of a loved one or ourselves. However, this is not a reason to lock yourself up forever and conceal yourself from life\u2019s challenges because then your life ends automatically. What we need to do is get up, push our problems aside and begin to fully accept life. Forget all of the issues that held you back; forget all of the people that say you can\u2019t; forget all of the pains and worries you carry on your shoulder. You do not need to carry the worries of the world in your heart. It is not up to you to handle the world\u2019s problems. But it is up to you to live and enjoy your life. It is up to you fill your days with laughter and smiles. It is up to you to out meaning to the little time we have on Earth. You need to be so full of joy that you can no longer feel pain. You should be so cheerful that your face begins to glow with happiness. You should radiate show much love and charm that others feel happy just by seeing you. Tomorrow may not be so you need to get up now and conquer your fears. Learn how to smile again if you forgot. Learn how to live; how to be happy.</p>\n<p>Live\u2026be happy\u2026smile\u2026tomorrow may not be\u2026kal ho naa ho.</p>\n<p>Xoxo J</p>\n", "post_id": 438, "location": false, "date": "04-29-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["relationships", "life", "strength", "genuine", "distress", "peace", "blessings", "HardTimes", "forgiveness"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://aminellie.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/give-forgiveness.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-443 alignnone\" src=\"https://aminellie.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/give-forgiveness.jpg?w=584&#038;h=403\" alt=\"Give-Forgiveness\" width=\"584\" height=\"403\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As the month of April comes to an end and the first third of the year has already passed, let us take a moment to look back at our experiences. We may have had some beautiful days while others were not so good. The best days of our lives so far may have happened during that time but also the worst. Friends we will keep for a lifetime may have entered our lives in those months. Maybe those days will be the fascinating stories we tell our future generations; or maybe those are the times we want to burn our memories and lock out of our hearts.</p>\n<p>There may have been days where you felt pain, anger, frustration, hatred, sorrow, grief and depression. Perhaps this was the fault of a relative or close friend. It could have been someone whom never thought would hurt you that caused you immense pain. These situations happen to the best us and we can choose to carry those memories forever or to kick the person out of our lives. You can choose any option you think is most satisfying to you in dealing with such issues.</p>\n<p>But what you <em>have</em> to do is forgive. In any solution you adopt for this issue, forgiveness must be a part of it<em><strong>. You need to forgive that person, not because they need forgiveness or a second chance, but because you need peace.</strong></em> In fact you deserve peace. The only way to achieve peace is to let those thoughts go. In letting go, you must forgive. When you forgive someone, you are saying that no matter how bad they hurt you, you are able to release those thoughts from within. You will no longer feel pain. Those thoughts will have no place in your mind and will inevitably desert you. The weights of those memories will no longer be on your shoulders and you will begin to feel a difference. You will feel that the person is no longer an issue in your life and you simply will not care. Even if you see that person you not be reminded of those hard times. This is because you have forgiven that person. That is peace.</p>\n<p>So think about those who have hurt you for those few months and forgive them. Let those memories escape you mind forever. Feel the peace that you deserve. So your task for the upcoming month is to release all grudges from your heart and mind, forgive, and let us know how that goes for you.</p>\n<p>xoxo,\u00a0 we wish you best of luck and countless blessings in your life for the month of May. <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-heart' title='&lt;3'>&lt;3</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Help encourage others by joining\u00a0the Coffee for Your Heart project on\u00a0holleygerth.com<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight:normal;color:#4c4d4f;\">\u00a0</span><a style=\"font-weight:normal;color:#4c4d4f;\" href=\"http://holleygerth.com/coffee-for-your-heart-love/\">http://holleygerth.com/coffee-for-your-heart-love/</a>\u00a0:)</p>\n", "post_id": 442, "location": false, "date": "04-29-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["lessons", "life", "strength", "pain", "distress", "sadness", "growth", "experiences", "depression", "inspiration"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://aminellie.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/598713_567753373235964_364766695_n.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-449 size-full\" src=\"https://aminellie.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/598713_567753373235964_364766695_n.jpg?w=584&#038;h=389\" alt=\"598713_567753373235964_364766695_n\" width=\"584\" height=\"389\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Life comes with much pain. Sometimes the pain becomes so over-bearing that we feel as though we may explode into trillions of pieces. Pain that cannot be subdued, plagues us night after night and day after day. We eventually lose control of ourselves and fall into bleak despair. We sometimes respond to this by self injury because the pain seems as though it&#8217;s flowing in our blood streams and needs to be release. The hurt and anger\u00a0that lurks within us begins to slowly grab hold of our sanity and we feel our mind slipping away into the realms\u00a0of sadness, loneliness and hopelessness.</p>\n<p>But that anguish, torture and pain that you feel growing inside you is the &#8216;breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding.&#8217; That build up of agony is your mind&#8217;s way of telling you that you now breaking free from the chains that held you down in the past. It is a means of growth. You grow by experiencing pain and learning how to deal with painful situations. Life throws these challenges at us but these situations all occur for a purpose. We are able to learn many lessons from there challenges and are able to handle them better when they occur in the future.</p>\n<p>Even as the shell of the seed must break, that its heart may grow into a tree, so must you know pain. The pain you feel is your shell breaking and growth taking place.</p>\n<p>We hope this post gives you some insight on the pain you feel deep inside and you are able to be strong during these times knowing that you are gaining a lesson from it and your shell is breaking so that you can grow into something more beautiful! <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)</span> <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)</span></p>\n", "post_id": 448, "location": false, "date": "05-01-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["motivation", "brave", "Chances", "Positivity", "experience", "courage"], "text": "<p><img src=\"https://aminellie.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/10007457_696950840368945_353260655_n.jpg\" class=\"size-full\" alt=\"Take the Chance\" /></p>\n<p>Thinking about doing something but also having second thoughts?

And almost everyone complain about having having. They don&#8217;t know how to study, don&#8217;t know what to study, don&#8217;t know how to begin, to distracted to study, too bored or tired to study and sooo much more endless complaints. But despite all those excuses, studying really is not that hard. Here are a few tips on studying for those finals&#8230;or cramming two weeks before the exams:</p>\n<p>1) <strong>POSITIVE MINDSET</strong>- I think this might be the most important. Instead of saying &#8216;uurghh why me, I gonna fail anyway, it&#8217;s too late,&#8217; try telling yourself that you can do it. Tell yourself that you have enough time to cram and you will learn everything, you will study everything, you will understand the work and you will pass!! Even if you think you are completely hopeless, still keep a positive mindset. It will make you feel as though there is still hope and you can still study and pass.</p>\n<p>2) <strong>GET A SYLLABUS</strong> &#8211; Get the syllabus that was outlined for the course you are doing. If a syllabus is not available, get the general topics you are supposed to study. This will help you because you will know exactly what you are supposed to have learned and you can study from that.</p>\n<p>3) <strong>GET NOTES</strong>- Get notes on allllll the topics that were supposed to be covered during the course. If you don&#8217;t have notes form classes, use google (yahoo or those that no one knows about&#8230;whatever browser you use), or ask a friend.</p>\n<p>4)<strong> HIGHLIGHT</strong>- read through the notes and highlight or underline all the main points and important information.</p>\n<p>5) <strong>RE WRITE</strong> &#8211; Write over all the important notes you have in your own words. This will help you in understanding the work and remembering. Get examples for everything. Use current examples form your society.</p>\n<p>6) <strong>MAKE CRAM NOTES</strong> &#8211; Get sheets of paper (printing paper not those with lines) and make notes on all the important topics. Write main points and important information. You should use only one sheet of paper per topic.</p>\n<p>7) <strong>DISCUSS</strong>- Discuss the topics with someone not doing the subject and who is completely clueless. Explain the work to that person. This will help because in explaining the work to someone else, you be ensuring that you understand it also. They may ask questions that are relevant for your understanding and that may even come in the exams. Also they may give their point to view, examples and criticisms.</p>\n<p>8) <strong>CHARTS</strong>- Make charts of your important notes and stick them on your bedroom walls. Comparisons can be put on a chart. Also diagrams; if you are studying for example the human body, then you can draw the systems and parts on diagrams and stick it up. If you are studying society, poverty mas can be useful&#8230;etc.</p>\n<p>9)<strong>CONCEPT/ MIND MAPS</strong> &#8211; Do concept maps. First you begin by writing the topic, then the main points and then link the main points to other points. This is what a concept map looks like:\u00a0<a href=\"http://aminellie.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/images-12.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-494\" src=\"https://aminellie.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/images-12.jpg?w=256&#038;h=182\" alt=\"images (12)\" width=\"256\" height=\"182\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can make it all colourful and interesting if you like.</p>\n<p>10) <strong>BRAINSTORMING</strong>- Get a sheet of paper, write the topic and then just write anything and everything that comes to mind about the topic.</p>\n<p>11) <strong>TAKE BREAKS</strong> &#8211; Take breaks after you studying a topic. About 10 minutes break should be enough. Or if you can&#8217;t sit for long periods, study for 15 minutes then take a five mutes break. <em>Your breaks should not be longer than the study session.</em></p>\n<p>12)<strong> EAT FIRST</strong>- <em>Do not attempt to study on an empty stomach.</em> IT does not work. Get something good to eat first but do not overeat.</p>\n<p>13) <strong>SLEEP</strong>- Get enough sleep.<em> DO NOT pull all nighters.</em> This is the worst thing ever. You need sleep to be able to formulate and retain the information in your brain.</p>\n<p>14) <strong>WRITE LISTS</strong> &#8211; Write lists of the topics you are going to cover for the day. Then when you do them, cross them out. This will give you a goal and keep you focussed throughout the day.</p>\n<p>Sooo&#8230;this is my simple compilation of tips on studying.

So whenever I hear these sayings I always tend to think that to have the time of your life you should be partying hard and hanging out all day with friends, buying tons of frivolous stuff and just living a really laid back lifestyle. Do you ever get that picture in your mind when you hear those types of sayings??</p>\n<p>Well&#8230;to be honest, you don&#8217;t. You need to be partying all night and drinking and hanging out all day to live life to the fullest. In any situation you are in, you can enjoy life. You can have the time of your lives in the most awkward situations. Those times where you least expect to have fun, can be the best times of your life&#8230;only if you are able to make it so.</p>\n<p>My friends and I were completely not expecting to have so much fun that day. But it was awessommeee. Who would think that walking home soaking wet in rain would be fun? Those were actually one of the best days we ever had while walking home and it really was a wonderful time. The trick to it though, was that we could have complained and looked for shelter, but we chose not to. We decided that it would be cool to just run through the rain and play in it. We made that choice to make that drag situation a cheerful and joyous time.</p>\n<p>So although we were not partying, drinking, hanging out or any of that sorts, we still had the time of our lives that day. Simply because we made a dreadful rainy day into fun day. So you don&#8217;t need to spend tons of money and do extravagant stuff to have an fulfilled life. You just need to make everyday and every single situation count. Even though it may seem lame, it could actually be a really fun time but only if you choose to do so. YOU have to make fun times in every situation you encounter.</p>\n", "post_id": 502, "location": false, "date": "05-20-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["hairstyle", "fashion", "curly", "beauty", "hair", "wavy"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://aminellie.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/thumb.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-507\" src=\"https://aminellie.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/thumb.jpg?w=240&#038;h=200\" alt=\"thumb\" width=\"240\" height=\"200\" /></a></p>\n<p>Hey guys&#8230;I figured out a really really easy way to get wavy or curly hair. NO HEAT NEEDED <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-bigsmile' title=':D'>:D</span></p>\n<p>So first of all, you just need to wash your hair as usual&#8230;with shampoo and conditioner. Towel dry for a few seconds until it&#8217;s a bit dry. Let it air dry, but while it is still a little damp apply oil or moisturizer or whatever product you use in your hair. Then plait you hair into one simple plait (while it&#8217;s still slightly damp). Leave it for the day or the night. I usually do it in the night. Then when you&#8217;re ready, loose your hair from the plait and wallaaaaaaa&#8230;now you have wavy hair. *angels sing, heaven&#8217;s light shines*</p>\n<p>If you want it really curly, you can plait your hair into more plaits and plait it tighter and smaller.</p>\n<p>It looks really really nice and it&#8217;s almost effortless!! <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)</span> <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-bigsmile' title=':D'>:D</span><br />\nYou guys should definitely\u00a0try it&#8230;tell me in the comments if it works for you and what you think about it <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-bigsmile' title=':D'>:D</span> <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-heart' title='&lt;3'>&lt;3</span> &#8230;send me a pic via facebook too \u00a0^_^</p>\n", "post_id": 506, "location": false, "date": "05-21-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["achievements", "confidence", "strength", "limits", "Chances", "Positive", "life", "motivation", "courage", "goals", "impossible", "Fear", "Trying", "dreams", "inspiration"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://aminellie.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/1526404_10152443234846788_1983958436264480168_n.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-512 aligncenter\" src=\"https://aminellie.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/1526404_10152443234846788_1983958436264480168_n.jpg?w=500&#038;h=500\" alt=\"1526404_10152443234846788_1983958436264480168_n\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Is something you want to do but think you can&#8217;t?

Be brave, be courageous&#8230;gather up all your strength and dive into the task full fledged with confidence. Prepare well and do it. Do that thing you are afraid of doing. You will conquer your fears, gain new experience, gain a lesson and do something new.

Don&#8217;t lie to me&#8230;of course you have fears. EVERYONE HAS FEARS. One of the main fears people have are of what society thinks. Very often before we make a decision or take on a task we ask ourselves &#8221;what will people think, will they laugh, will they scold?&#8221; We even ask our friends to justify what we&#8217;re about to do. We need justification from our friends to know if it will seem \u00a0&#8216;okay&#8217; or \u00a0&#8216;acceptable&#8217; by society. If people don&#8217;t like it then we divert our actions into something else&#8230;something people will like. This is because we like feeling accepted by society, we enjoy the praise we get from following the crowd. But are we really doing what WE want to do? Or are we doing what society wants us to do? We are living in accordance to what others think because we are afraid. We are afraid that if we do something different we will be shunned.</p>\n<p>Is that really living? Is confining our true selves and concealing it from the world really living? Are we getting the real essence of life when we do this? When we live by what others want to see because we are scared to show who we really are&#8230;is that living? If you think it is, what kind of life is that? The enjoyment you feel is not from within. It is determined by external factors and therefore it will fade. The joy from being accepted for doing what society wants in not joy that will last. Living by the fear that people will neglect because you do something different is not living at all. You will begin to live when you get rid of those fears. When you burn all the fears on what society will think, is when you will begin to feel the true joy of life.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>HOWEVER &#8211; This does not mean it is okay to commit violent acts. Being different does not refer to violence or crime. It refers to showing your true personality and your different culture&#8230;&#8230;as long as it is not harming anyone else or scarring them. Just saying.</p>\n<p>What are you afraid of showing to society? What do you hold back inside? What mask do you wear everyday??</p>\n<p>But more importantly&#8230;what mask are you going to burn today? What true colours are you going to show? What joys of life are you going to experience?

When a difficulty occur we tend to let it consume us. We spend every waking second worrying about it and at night we&#8217;re up crying.</p>\n<p>When something happens and we spend all our time thinking about it, it will eventually begin to overtake us&#8230;we will not be able to think clearly or function properly. This is because we open ourselves up to our problems. We become vulnerable. Most of the issues in our lives are not more than a simple dilemma but because we think about it so often it begins to be the only thing on our minds. We begin to worry more than we should and create situations that are not even there! Hence, much of the pain we feel are merely thoughts. Thoughts that we let overcome us and now they seem like huge problems.</p>\n<p>Sometimes we think about situations for too long and worry so much that when the thought enters our mind we are the ones that keep it in there. Maybe we could have solved the issue a while ago but because we became to worrisome and vulnerable that now it seems unfixable. Maybe we are the cause for some of our pain because we didn&#8217;t kill it when it occurred but we let it penetrate our minds and now it seems like it lives in us.</p>\n<p>Therefore the pain we feel is the pain that lives in our mind because we let our problems crawl into our mind and seize our thoughts.</p>\n", "post_id": 600, "location": false, "date": "05-25-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["blog", "life", "love", "help", "personal", "journal", "stress", "emotions", "feelings", "challenges", "hardships", "experiences", "lifestyle", "pain", "Fear", "writing", "blogging", "thoughts", "inspiration"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://aminellie.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/images.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-604\" src=\"https://aminellie.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/images.jpg?w=193&#038;h=262\" alt=\"images\" width=\"193\" height=\"262\" /></a>Many times, thoughts can disguise themselves as serious and chronic emotional pain and invade our minds. Sometimes we the ones that cause this because we entertain these thoughts in our minds for so long that they begin to grow. They make their abode in our minds and slowly commence in stealing our peace and\u00a0overtaking our minds. But how do we when our pain are really only thoughts?</p>\n<p>First we must look at the pain itself. What cause the pain? Why do we feel sad or depressed? Is there even a reason? Many times we don&#8217;t\u00a0even know why we feel pain! It seems as though it just appeared and we don&#8217;t even know the cause.\u00a0If we don&#8217;t know the cause of the pain then why are we feeling pain? There must be a cause but the cause may not be apparent. This is because we let the feelings reside with us for so long that we don&#8217;t even know why we feel sad anymore; we just feel pain. If we are able to find a specific reason for our pain then we must know the issue. Is the issue still occurring? Did it happen in the past? If it was something that happened in the past then it is evident that the distress from that issue crept into our minds and we let it stay there. We let it form itself into a permanent mark of the issue which develops into permanent pain.</p>\n<p>When we put of plans because we\u00a0have a lot on our minds, when we can&#8217;t enjoy anything because we constantly feel perturbed, when we find ourselves drifting back to the thoughts that cause the pain such as the issue, when our minds feel stuffed and our thoughts overwhelm us&#8230;that is when we know our pain are just only thoughts.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "post_id": 603, "location": false, "date": "05-25-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["love", "people", "Positive", "Positivity", "Negative", "sad", "write", "personal", "writing", "blog", "start", "sunday", "tea", "new", "happy", "life", "monday", "journal", "depressing", "world", "blogging", "lifestyle", "new beginnings"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://aminellie.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/78abfa8991805acb854096af89c85dca.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-609\" src=\"https://aminellie.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/78abfa8991805acb854096af89c85dca.jpg?w=480&#038;h=480\" alt=\"78abfa8991805acb854096af89c85dca\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\" /></a></p>\n<p>Helloooo my dear honey pies <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)</span> It is Sunday evening in some parts of the world and Monday in some.So here&#8217;s to a new week ahead of us&#8230;a new chance to change, to do what we love, to overcome obstacles.

Our experiences in life can teach us many things that we may not have learnt if until we experienced them. They can actually prepare us for tougher times in the future.</p>\n<p>Your issues may seem purposeless right now and they may feel burdensome but there is an underlying lesson. Whether it be the ability to overcome such (or worst) situations faster, learning how to react or learning how to prepare for it, it is a lesson and you will gain something. You may gain the ability to help others through similar issues, the ability to fight off these problems or the ability to ignore these issues. Whatever you learn may actually be off use to you in the future and you will then be thankful that you had previous experiences that shaped you.</p>\n<p>Many of these situations will continue to occur until you&#8217;ve learnt your lesson. Until you learn how to overcome them or how to avoid them, they will obviously continue to happen. Therefore you must gain the lesson of the situation before it ends and apply to your future situations.</p>\n<p>So look at the challenges in your life and find the lesson. Find the lesson, learn it and keep it in mind so you can use it again and you will be able to overcome or avoid the problem in the future <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)</span> <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)</span></p>\n", "post_id": 632, "location": false, "date": "05-31-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["life", "lifestyle", "personal", "breaks", "work", "motivation", "culture", "journal", "stress", "action", "inspiration"], "text": "<p><a href=\"https://aminellie.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/download.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-636\" src=\"https://aminellie.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/download.jpg?w=273&#038;h=184\" alt=\"download\" width=\"273\" height=\"184\" /></a></p>\n<p>Good morning, good afternoon, good evening guys <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-bigsmile' title=':D'>:D</span></p>\n<p>Make today (or tomorrow if it&#8217;s night by you) a day to relax.

So take a break today or tomorrow and you this time to rejuvenate yourself. It is okay to take a rest sometimes. You can spend it with the family, sleeping or whatever you find relaxing.

A new month, a new week, a new day. A change to complete what you didn&#8217;t finish in May.

When you forgive someone you are letting go of the issue they caused in your life and you are releasing this weight from yourself. You are releasing the burden of having to remember them and hold that grudge and you will find peace. You are saying that no matter how bad they hurt you, you are able to release those burdens from yourself and let yourself live a life free of grudges and therefore live a life with peace.</p>\n<p>I also said to use the month of May\u00a0to forgive those that hurt you in the past. If you didn&#8217;t do it, or you you were hurt even more in May by people, then use the \u00a0month of June to release those burdens and forgive. Begin the new month with a clean heart and you will find tranquility. If you did try to forgive, tell us how it went. How did the task of forgiving work out for you? If you are now undertaking this task, you can also tell us how it goes.

Everything must and will change. To be able to adapt to new surroundings we must evolve. To be able to progress in society we must change. For development to occur, we must change.</p>\n<p>Change however, is not something we are very fond of. We like our lives the way it is. We like having control of what happens to us and when change occurs we feel vulnerable. We feel vulnerable because we may not have as much control of our lives as we did before. We may even hit our lowest point. But we must be able to accept change. If we continue to run away from and avoid change we will be doing more harm than good to ourselves. So when change occurs in your life, do not despair. Do not hope for a better life or a life without change. Do not crumble. Hold on, because change usually brings development, progress, \u00a0and evolving and adapting to new lifestyles and environments. Change will occur when there is betterment ahead for you.<em> So hold on tight, close your eyes and believe.

As terrifying and sad as goodbyes are, the beginnings to come after will entice you. Just remember in situations such as these that, &#8216;this is just the beginning of a new start&#8217; So whatever it may be that you are bidding farewell to, always keep in mind that it&#8217;s not the end&#8230;just the beginning <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)</span></p>\n<p>-Kari</p>\n", "post_id": 67, "location": false, "date": "07-12-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["stress", "lifestyle", "joy", "life", "writing", "future", "happiness", "action", "love", "blogging", "motivation", "inspiration"], "text": "<p><a href=\"https://aminellie.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/4a8ea__8740641037_7e9c685c5f_z.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-682\" src=\"https://aminellie.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/4a8ea__8740641037_7e9c685c5f_z.jpg?w=584&#038;h=438\" alt=\"4a8ea__8740641037_7e9c685c5f_z\" width=\"584\" height=\"438\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you want to get different results you must do something different.

When is the time to change your ways?</p>\n<p>First we must establish goals. Look at your life right now. Take a few minutes and write down a few of your habits, daily routines, beliefs, norms. Then look into the future; what would you like to achieve in the future? Where do you want to see yourself? What do you want your life to be like? Then write those points down; also write what habits you want to adopt and what you want your daily life to look like. Now do some research if you have no idea how to achieve those goals. Research on how to achieve and what it&#8217;s like achieving and also how people&#8217;s life have turned out after they achieved those goals. Also research the\u00a0daily routines, habits, norms and lifestyle of people who have achieved that life.</p>\n<p><em>Now look at your habits and ask yourself if any of these habits coincide with achieving your goals. If the answer is no, then you know it is the time to change</em>. You must change those habits that do not help you reach your goals. The habits that deter you from achieving your goals must go.</p>\n<p>How to change is whole a different story. You must look at the habits you want to change and one by one let them disappear. Stop letting them grow; starve them instead. Then also slowly adopt new habits in place of the old habits. This will take a while but it is worth reaching your goals.</p>\n<p>What old habits deter you from achieving you goals? Do you think it&#8217;s time to change?</p>\n<p>((I may dedicate a whole other post on how to change you habits))</p>\n<p> <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)</span> <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)</span></p>\n", "post_id": 687, "location": false, "date": "06-05-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Chances", "Fear", "Doubts"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://aminellie.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/522957_445798215466044_198064214_n.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-70 aligncenter\" alt=\"522957_445798215466044_198064214_n\" src=\"https://aminellie.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/522957_445798215466044_198064214_n.jpg?w=300&#038;h=187\" width=\"300\" height=\"187\" /></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Lato, 'Segoe UI', Frutiger, Tahoma, Helvetica, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;\">Opportunities always come to us and we think &#8216; this is the wrong time, I&#8217;m not prepared at all.&#8217; We always end up blowing off chances to do something we always wanted.

Complete them fully before moving on and do them to the best of your abilities. Forget setbacks, drawbacks and excuses.

It is the way you look at a situation and interpret it; the way your mind understands something and what it makes of it.</p>\n<p>Our perspective on life is usually determined by experiences. We tend to hold past times in our mind and judge present and future situations based on those experiences. The way we interpret situations is not entirely out of free will; our intial or first impression or a situation is based on something from the past that has similar qualities.</p>\n<p>Take this for an example: when you were little you fell of something high such as a wall or your gallery. Now you may be afraid of heights because everytime you get close to the edge of a tall wall or building those memories from your past will surface. You will remember it and you will continue to be afraid.</p>\n<p>Therefore we are not entirely using free will to decipher situations. We are trapped. We are trapped in our own minds; being devoured by our own memories. They haunt us and they define how we view the world. Our past experiences are there to guide; they are not entirely a destructive device. They are there to warn us; or to let us know what may lie ahead. We use our past experiences to base our perspectives on because we need a guide so that we would not end up in a state of confusion or ignorance.</p>\n<p>However, we must be careful in what we base our perspectives on life on. Life is not something that is constant and therefore change will occur. Our experiences is not a definite answer to what lies ahead and what we should view a situation as. Sometimes when your experiences surface for you to use as a guide in a new situation, you must brush it aside and take up a new view of things. View things differently; treat things differently. Sometimes you must dare to ignore the past and try something different or something your experiences tell you you can&#8217;t do.</p>\n", "post_id": 708, "location": false, "date": "06-14-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["teen", "faith", "life", "lifestyle", "people", "stess", "blog", "love", "believe", "pain", "hardships", "hope"], "text": "<p><a href=\"https://aminellie.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/images1.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-713\" src=\"https://aminellie.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/images1.jpg?w=262&#038;h=193\" alt=\"images\" width=\"262\" height=\"193\" /></a></p>\n<p>Do you remember a time where everything seemed wrong and you felt more alone than ever?

Perspective usually entails norms and expectations. All of these aspects aid in shaping our perspectives since we usually tend to cling to them and base our lives around them. However, although this is an important part in developing a perspective on life we must not let it control out perspective because then we will be giving it power to control out lives. This is because the way we view a situation has the power to control what we see. When we develop a perspective, we tend to stick to this perspective for as long as we can because we need to be in some form of control and be able to interpret situations with information we already know. However, sometimes we hold on to that perspective so much that we end up having a &#8216;one-way&#8217; outlook on life.</p>\n<p>The situations we find ourselves in or our issues then to relate back to the perspective we hold. We when look at things in a particular way or through a particular lens we will only ever see it that way. <strong><em>But if you want things to change, you must change the way you look at things</em></strong>. Change how you think; have a different frame of mind or look at the situation from a different point of view. You may be surprised that you see an entirely new picture!</p>\n<p>For example: if you continue to look at a cloudy day as gloomy and dull you will begin to feel gloomy and dull whenever it is cloudy. You can choose to view a cloudy day as such and be dull for the rest of the day or you can view a cloudy day as a day where the air is cool and the sun is not beating down on your face and rain is about to fall and you will be given water and sustenance! The wells will be filled, the plants will be watered and the place will become cool!</p>\n<p>So you can choose to view things as you usually do and see things as you usually do.

One of the major problems of today&#8217;s society is that we focus our attention on being divided. Back in the days of slavery, the slave masters were the ones who forced division amoung the people! The European slave masters used to try their best to prevent co-operation and interaction amoung the people. They used to fill the enslaved&#8217;s minds with lies and slanders about each other and used to separate the ethnic groups. In many societies they separated the ethnic and racial groups so much that one group was located on one side of the country and the other was located on the other side of the country. And the slave masters filled the different groups of people&#8217;s minds with lies and they fabrications about the other groups! Why? Because they had one fear. One fear that could disrupt the entire system they implemented to gain power. That one fear was unity. They used to try their best to prevent the people from interacting and they filled their minds with lies so that they would hate each other so that they would never unite. They feared that when the people united they would be able to overthrow the system and defeat the heartless slave masters. They feared that they would have lost their power and\u00a0the people would become free.</p>\n<p>But today we do not need cruel European slave masters to instigate hate in us to prevent us from uniting. No. We do that ourselves! Today the society is still poisoned with the ideology that one group is better than the other. And this is what prevents the societies from moving foward and developing. Once we do not rid ourselves of these divisions we will never be able to achieve a greater good or development because we will always be in war!</p>\n<p>We need to rid ourselves of pride and arrogance and look beyond our own selfish desires and see that we need to unite regardless of any differences! We need to become one! We need to work together and help each other and build each other up instead of bringing each other down! We need to stop looking down on people, criticizing and stop harming our fellow humans! We need to be develop a love so strong that when one person hurts, we all hurts and when one person feels joy, we all feel joy for that person instead jealousy! When one person needs help, we need to all pitch in and help! When one person is suffering, we must all act together to stop the suffering.</p>\n<p>We are one people. One war. One love. One ummah.</p>\n<p>**That prophet (peace be upon him) is quoted to have said:\u00a0<strong>&#8220;The Believers, in their mutual love, mercy and compassion, are like one body: if one organ complained, the rest of the body develops a fever.&#8221;</strong>\u00a0[Bukhari &amp; Muslim]**</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "post_id": 757, "location": false, "date": "07-12-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["life", "lifestyle", "peace", "motivation", "writing", "blog", "stress", "frustration", "love", "blogging", "happiness", "inspiration"], "text": "<p><a href=\"https://aminellie.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/download1.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-762\" src=\"https://aminellie.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/download1.jpg?w=190&#038;h=266\" alt=\"download\" width=\"190\" height=\"266\" /></a>\u00a0When all else fails take a nap.

Everything, every single seems impossible until it&#8217;s done! Do you think the inventor of these new technological items such as phones and computer and electrical appliances knew that they were gonna be successful in creating such useful items that are necessities now?? No they didn&#8217;t but they had a dream and an idea and they pursued it! Do you think the one who now has a PhD (doctorate) knew since the age of 20 that they were going to \u00a0achieve this ? Of course not. At age 20 they were hating school and wishing for more parties; but they had a goal to reach and they did. Do you think the one who had memorized the entire qur&#8217;an knew from the start that he would be able to achieve this? No! But they tried still and they accomplished it! What about the one who survived a life of torture, depression and sucidalness? Noo, they\u00a0thought they would have died! But they made it. And so can you!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Things will always seem impossible to achieve but unless you try, you will never know. Take the first step today and you will see that everything else will automatically come into light. You must walk closer to the goal for it to be in your line of view. You must persevere when you think you can&#8217;t continue any longer. You must try harder and push yourself to the limits and then defy those limits! When you achieve you goals you will look back and happy for yourself :)\u00a0</p>\n<p>So I tell you today that you have hope, you can go on and you can achieve whatever you think is impossible. So stop labeling things as impossible and start taking the first step!\u00a0</p>\n<p>What do you what to accomplish that seems impossible?? <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)</span></p>\n", "post_id": 766, "location": false, "date": "07-25-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["life", "lifestyle", "business", "success", "people", "muslim", "writing", "blog", "quotes", "goals", "love", "inspiration", "islam"], "text": "<p>There are so many things we all plan to do.

It is a disease. It is something that has the power to snatch our happiness from us at any time and replace it with feelings of discomfort. Envy is selfish and it makes us feel as though we are not enough and we not nothing compared what others are and we need to become like them. It makes us want to be like others or even better than others. It does not satisfy us in any way but instead it leaves a longing and a feeling of deep dissatisfaction; we feel an emptiness that can only be filled by gaining the blessings that which others possess.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Many times when we see people displaying their blessings openly we begin to feel as though we are unfortunate and unlucky. It seems as though we are on the side with the dried up, brown grass in the garden. But\u00a0being to pursue the riches of this life to defeat that feeling and we chase it so much that we lose everything along the way. We lose our family, friends and time. With the loss of these aspects in life, love will no longer be a part of our lives. Then very soon our happiness will be at bay and replaced with misery. We feel miserable \u00a0every time we see someone with something that we do not own or cannot afford. We realize how impoverished we are and we notice every fault in the things we own. Nothing we own becomes enough anymore. But have we stopped to think that the grass may be greener on the other side because we look at it with envy?? These feelings we feel are results of envy??\u00a0</p>\n<p>Every time we feel jealous of someone else&#8217;s blessings, we become dissatisfied with what we own and discontent. We lose our minds of the desire to have what ours have. Do not succumb to envy!! Do not let this disease possess you. You are more fortunate that many of the people in this world! You do not need the things others have; do not let yourself be deceived by the life of this world. Do not lose yourself in the process of gaining what others have because you do not like what you own. Be content with what you own. Be satisfied with your own belongings. At the same time you should aim for a higher goal but do not let this be because you want what others have. Know the difference between envy and ambition.

Every few minutes my beautiful friend <a href=\"http://p.feedblitz.com/t2.asp?/870840/30510095/4599447/feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/holley.gerth/~www.redletterwords.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Dee</a> pauses and points, <em>\u201cLook there\u2019s a starfish!\u201d</em> or <em>\u201cI see a crab!\u201d</em></p>\n<p>I stare into the tide pools to discover a world all its own. Starfish the colors of sunset. Sea anemones opening up to wave their tiny fingers as if saying hello. Hermit crabs scuttling across the ocean floor on missions known only to them.</p>\n<p><em>All of this exists all the time.</em></p>\n<p><em>But we only see it at low tide.</em></p>\n<p>I think of low tide times in my life\u2013moments when it seemed the waves of joy were swept out to sea. I felt exposed, vulnerable, as if everyone could peer inside my heart and see exactly what was there. And I always assumed it was not beautiful.</p>\n<p><em>But what if that isn\u2019t true at all? What if in the moments of \u201clow tide\u201d in our lives our strength and faith\u00a0becomes most visible in us?</em></p>\n<p>Dare to let someone look into your heart and see hope stretching out like starfish, sticky sides refusing to let go or give up.</p>\n<p>Dare to let someone watch the closed spaces within you open in new ways that make everyone around you braver too\u2013even if they never say so.</p>\n<p>Dare to let someone catch a glimpse of your mission in this world and how small, awkward steps can lead to big, glorious things.</p>\n<p>Yes, of course we want our hearts to stay hidden. We don\u2019t like feeling exposed. We\u2019re human, after all. But that is not how we live. We\u2019re meant for a rhythm\u2013a going out and coming in, filling and emptying, low and high tide. Joy and sorrow.</p>\n<p>Hours later I stand at the edge of the beach and watch the waves crash. The space where I walked earlier has become invisible. But I know it\u2019s there. When I close my eyes I can still picture it. It changes how I think of the ocean. It changes how I think of myself.</p>\n<p>Don\u2019t be afraid of low tide, my friend. It will not last forever. And the parts of your heart you\u2019re afraid of having others see are more beautiful and full of wild grace than you can even imagine. While you sometimes wonder if you\u2019re doing okay, the world just might be watching in wonder.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Do you love the beach? When last did you visit? Tell me in the comments <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)</span> Also, if you have pics of beaches you have been or beaches near you, then you can email them to me at iamlucylou19@hotmail.com \u00a0.

Seriously, my lips are constantly dry and cracking and bursting and just really really gross! But when I tried baby lips medicated lip balm, my lips healed sooo fast! In about one or two night my lips healed. So I just put it on at night and wake up with soft and smooth lips. So I went and bought a whole lot of them, but I gave some of them away as gifts&#8230;and they people whom I gave them too said the same thing! It worked great for them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 In the summer your lips can become very\u00a0cracked, dry, bursting or peeling, I would definitely recommend this lip balm!! Also they make great, simple gifts for people. * This is by the Maybelline brand so you would find it under the Maybelline section of your store. Do you have really dry lips? How do you heal them??

You do not have to act in accordance to your past. You can start over and become better.</p>\n<p>There may have been a time in our lives that we experienced\u00a0a serious traumatic event which has greatly impacted on our lives. Maybe it has affected the way we think, we act, we look at people or the things we do. Maybe it has prevented us from doing certain things we wanted to do or maybe it made us do things we didn&#8217;t want to do. But why do we let something that has happened in the past to control our future? Why do we let that one time in the past ruin our present? Why is it that we tend to feel bad about something that has happened in the past and let it prevent us from being who we really want to be?\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are times where we will have to revisit our past and that is to make sure we do not commit the same acts again, make the mistakes again or react the way again. We should look at our past to gain a lesson from the experiences we had and then let it be. We cannot change the past but we can change the present and the future. We should not allow the past to tie us down, to haunt us so much that we fall into a depression and suffer everyday. We need to keep on going. Do not stop to stare at past; we need to keep moving. We need to believe in ourselves and all that we are, accept what has happened in the past and move forward.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We are not what happened to us in the past. We are now, we are this moment. What will we do with it? What will we choose to become?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you know anyone struggling with something that has occurred in the past, please share this with them. Try to show them that they do not need to struggle with their past. Are you struggling or have you struggled with something that has happened in the past? You can share your experiences in the comments <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)</span> It might help someone who is experiencing similar issues <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)</span> :)\u00a0</p>\n", "post_id": 783, "location": false, "date": "08-13-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["life", "suicide", "love", "hardship", "people", "muslim", "writing", "blog", "quotes", "inspiration", "depression", "islam"], "text": "<p><a href=\"https://aminellie.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/images-1.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-784\" src=\"https://aminellie.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/images-1.jpg?w=259&#038;h=194\" alt=\"images (1)\" width=\"259\" height=\"194\" /></a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Many times in life we find ourselves blaming other people for the issues in our own lives. We deny responsibility for what happened and try to shove all of the blame on someone else. We do this because we do not want to feel guilty, or feel bad for what happened. Every thing that goes &#8216;wrong&#8217; in our lives, we say that it was the cause of someone else. But by doing this, we are actually giving someone else power over us. By saying that someone else is the cause of something that happened to us, we are giving them the power to create problems in our lives and we are giving them the ability to cause confusion, disruption and chaos in our lives.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When we put the blame on someone else, we are actually causing more harm to ourselves. We are giving them the power to control situations in our lives and we are denying ourselves the ability to handle any situation that comes to us. When we say that we failed that test because of John, we are saying that John has the power over us to make us fail a test.( no offence to any Johns out there, just an example!)\u00a0</p>\n<p>So instead of putting all the blame on someone else, try taking some responsibility for the things that happen in your life. I am not saying blame yourself for every thing, I am saying that it is time we all grow up and stop giving people the power to control our lives. I only take one person to change your and it is you. you are the only one who has the ability to control where you go from here and you are the only one that can control your happiness.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Do you find yourself blaming others people for something that occurred in your life? What have you blamed people for?

They are : &#8216;Gratitude challenge&#8217; and &#8216;Back to School&#8217; posts.</p>\n<p><strong>THE GRATITUDE CHALLENGE</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://aminellie.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/download.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-789\" src=\"https://aminellie.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/download.jpg?w=300&#038;h=147\" alt=\"download\" width=\"300\" height=\"147\" /></a></p>\n<p>Gratitude is the quality or feeling of being thankful, grateful, content or/and satisfied. I really believe that gratitude is an important part of lives and it brings great feelings of peace and happiness! Being grateful should not only be when we achieve something or when we get something new; we should be grateful for everything we have at every second. I strongly believe that being grateful can uplift one&#8217;s happiness because we learn get a sense of satisfaction, contentment and appreciation when we choose to be grateful for what we have.</p>\n<p>The gratitude challenge \u00a0is a challenge where we posts daily about things we are grateful for. But to start of slowly and make it into a habit we will post the amount of things we are grateful for based on what day it is. For example on day 1 we will post one thing, on day 2 we will post two things&#8230;etc. We do hope for continue this for quite a while! We hope to begin this tomorrow!! We also hope that you can join us!! You can take part in the gratitude challenge by posting and making the title of the post &#8216; Gratitude Challenge day #&#8230;&#8217; and you can post the link of our blog in your post and we will share your post. You can even spice it up by posting pics or anything else! SO TOMORROW, MONDAY AUGUST 25th we are begining!

Small things like seeing a super cute cat in the park, or drinking cold water when really thirsty, anything just to pull me out of the negative/constantly complaining area I was in \u2013 still am probably, but fighting to get out <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-tongue' title=':P'>:P</span></p>\n\n<p>So, here goes:</p>\n\n<p>Yesterday I had a pretty, PRETTY hectic day at the office and it was hard not to snap at any of my colleagues. While I was trying to cool down I realized I should be grateful for this job, even though it is not my dream job, because other people are in search of jobs for months on end without any success. So, here\u2019s\u2026</p>\n</div><p class=\"reblog-source\"><a href=\"http://theeverythingaisle.wordpress.com/2014/08/26/gratitude-challenge-numero-uno-y-dos\">View original</a> <span class=\"more-words\">63 more words</span></p></div></div>", "post_id": 801, "location": false, "date": "08-27-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["summer", "school", "teenage", "study", "life", "writing", "blog", "college", "exams", "teens", "teenager", "tips", "inspiration"], "text": "<p><a href=\"https://aminellie.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/b2s.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-804 aligncenter\" src=\"https://aminellie.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/b2s.jpg?w=300&#038;h=274\" alt=\"Back to school stamp\" width=\"300\" height=\"274\" /></a></p>\n<p>So summer has ended and it&#8217;s that time of the year again. The time where we must return to the institutions from hell!!! Just kidding! Going back to school or starting school doesn&#8217;t have to be stressful at all! It can actually be fun and exciting! Well I&#8217;m done with school for now; first September in 16 years I&#8217;m not going back to school!! WOOHOOOOO!!!! *Ahem* As I was saying, I have used my experience, lessons and knowledge about school to compile a list of tips for going back to or starting school. Leggo. (for those who don&#8217;t know, leggo is slang for let&#8217;s go.)</p>\n<p>1)<em><strong> Buy USED textbooks</strong></em> &#8211; You would not believe how important this is. Why buy brand new textbooks for hundreds of dollars when you can buy a used version of the same book for half or three quarter of the price? The only difference is the price! Ain&#8217;t nobody care if your books new or old!! You may even get side notes or answers or highlights in the used one! You will save sooooo much money, I am not lying!!\u00a0</p>\n<p>2)<em><strong>Wear Simple Clothes, Shoes, Hairstyles etc</strong></em> &#8211; Dressing up for school is utterly SENSELESS!!! It is a complete waste of time, money and effort! When you get all dressed up for school, then going to other places such as parties or the mall or to dinner with the family you will look the same!! Honestly the best thing is to dress simply for school so when you go out you will look different, and nicer! Don&#8217;t go wearing your most expensive clothes , highest heels and fanciest hairstyles to school! Wear them to go out. To school you can wear a simple jeans and t shirt with a simple ponytail and flats. As for makeup, you should only wear lip balm to keep your lips moist. Trust me, it is sooo much less to worry about when you dress simply; you don&#8217;t run out of clothes, you don&#8217;t need too much effort in choosing an outfit and you don&#8217;t need to get new clothes too often! Comment if you would like a post on simple outfit ideas for school.\u00a0</p>\n<p>3) <em><strong>Carry Lunch, Snacks and Water</strong> </em>- Carrying lunch, snacks and water can save you a ton load of money. Do a budget for the amount of money you would spend on these in school throughout the month and realize how much you can save!! Comment below if you would like a post on simple lunches for school.</p>\n<p>4) <em><strong>Plan your Day and Night</strong> </em>- making a schedule for your days and nights can help you stay on track, remember what you have to do and stay focused. Just make sure you follow the schedule! It&#8217;s easy, plan the main things you have to do, put in some time for smaller tasks such as eating, bathing etc and leave some free time for random stuff and emergencies. What a post on how to make a practical schedule? Lemme know below.\u00a0</p>\n<p>5) <em><strong>Have All Books and Stationery Organized</strong> </em>- Having a place for everything and keeping them neat and tidy ensures that you know where everything is! You will be able to find them soon; you will not lose them. If you have to hurry in the morning or night or find a book soon to complete work, you will know where to look because everything is organized! It prevents a lot of stress and worrying since you would not have to worry over losing your stuff or not being able to find it. Also if you are short on time you can find them quickly!\u00a0</p>\n<p>6)<em><strong>Pack your Bag the Night Before</strong></em> &#8211; this tip is very useful as it prevents delays and keep backs in the morning. If you have to catch the school bus early or get dropped early then you won&#8217;t have to worry about packing your bag because it is already packed! Take 5 -10 minutes before you sleep every night and pack your bag for the next day. It is very practical and helpful! If you want a post on what to put in your bag/what&#8217;s in my schoolbag, comment below and tell me.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So those are some short tips for going back to school. Lemme know how they work for you and any other tip you may have, feel free to state in the comments! It may help someone! When are you going back to school?? <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)</span> <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)</span></p>\n", "post_id": 805, "location": false, "date": "08-27-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>Helloooo my fellow homo sapiens!

Due to some choice WE made, we can experience those feelings. It may sound like a bunch of happy go lucky bull, but the reality is that we are ones who bring distress upon our selves and we can also bring happiness upon ourselves if try.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Being happy, peaceful, and calm does not have to depend on your relationship, job, school, people or money. It starts with YOU. Only you! Only you can control how to react to situations, only you can choose not to get angry, only you can choose to enjoy simple things in life, only you can choose to smile every morning.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I know sometimes people may hurt our feelings and things will happen that will make us sad, but permanent sadness is something brought on by ourselves. We are the ones who choose to worry about everything, fuss about small things, not smile everyday, criticize everything and this in turn brings on a wave of depression or sadness. It is controlled solely by you. If you want you can choose to change your attitude, to find things everyday that make you happy. You can dig out the simple things that we should be grateful for.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Most of times if you have undergone a long period of sadness, grief, heartaches, depression, stress, hate, frustration, distress, despair and anger, you will have a harder time finding things to be happy for and have a harder time changing your mental attitude. But you have to dig deep and search. It will be\u00a0above all of the distress and buried deep in the little things in life. You have to rise above the pain to find it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So today I challenge you to a step in changing your life. Everyday, try a little to change your mindset and adopt a more positive mindset rather than negative. Here&#8217;s one way how: For every bad thought, think three positive and happy thoughts. You can also list things during the day that made you happy; list no less than 3. You can also take part in our gratitude challenge.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Are you letting your happiness be determined by external conditions? How are you gonna change that?? Tell me in the comments!

It\u2019s a horrible feeling. Many times in life we will have to fight for something we love. Where it is a person or an item or a dream, it is a painful situation to be in. Not knowing if to give up or to continue trying. That is one of life\u2019s trickiest and hardest tests. How do you know if you are making the right decision? You never really know until you make the decision. Sometimes you need to take the chance and continue trying. But there are also times where you must give up. No not give up, stop trying. It\u2019s not so much giving up as it is letting go. Letting go is not the same thing as giving up, it\u2019s taking it to a higher level. Knowing that the person you love does not and will not love you is heart wrenching and horrifyingly painful but that is how you know that letting go of that person is the right choice. If you are truly in love with the person, you will consider their needs before yours. You will love them no matter what. You will do your best just to make them happy and if it does not include you well then so be it!</p>\n<p>Why do we get depressed and angry with someone when they don\u2019t love us back? Why do we feel as though we must make them like us and force ourselves onto them? Why do feel like we need to break up their current relationships so we could be with them? It\u2019s selfish. Love is not selfish but sometimes it makes people do selfish things.\u00a0 If the person is happy with someone else then we need to leave it as it is. Interfering with their lives and messing it up so we could get our way, or hating their partner to express our pain is only going to do more harm. We will be hurting the person we love and if it is truly love it should feel worse that hurting ourselves. If you really love this person, you need to accept who they are and if they have a happy home with a wife or husband and kids then you need to leave it alone. If the person finds love somewhere else and is in a relationship or is not looking for a relationship at the moment then you need to leave that alone. Let them think for themselves. Let them decide if they love you or not, let them decide if they will be happier with a change, let them decide if they want a different partner. \u00a0Choosing to let go can be the harder of the two choices but if it must be done then allow it to be done. Allow the person you love to feel love and experience its wonders. \u00a0Let them experience true happiness and bliss. Even if it means the person you love marrying someone else and then having kids and living a lifetime without you, then allow it if it means they will be happy and delighted.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Sometimes we have to fight for what we love and care about but sometimes we need to find the strength to let go.\u00a0 If you truly love someone you\u2019ll want them to be happy even if it\u2019s not with you.</strong></em></p>\n", "post_id": 857, "location": false, "date": "09-24-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["life", "love", "cancer", "personal", "research", "blog", "health", "writing", "blogging", "inspiration"], "text": "<p>Today (26th September) is Mesothelioma Awareness Day and someone requested that I post on mesothelioma.

Well it\u2019s a very rare cancer that can affect anyone and everyone. It is not due to personal lifestyle choices and habits but rather it is due to the external environment. So today I want to share some knowledge on this fatal illness.</p>\n<p>Mesothelioma is <em>cancer</em> of the mesothelium, a protective membrane that lines most of the body&#8217;s internal organs. Most times the disease begins in the organs of the chest cavity such as lungs and heart but can also occur in the abdominal cavity. This disease, once planted, can spread throughout the body and infect the entire body.</p>\n<p><strong>Causes</strong></p>\n<p>One the main cause of mesothelioma is <strong>asbestos.</strong></p>\n<p>What are asbestos you ask? You think you are not in contact with asbestos? Well there\u2019s a chance you are\u2026there\u2019s a chance we all are!<br />\n<em>Asbestos is a naturally occurring fibrous mineral</em>. It is fire resistant, chemical resistant and an excellent insulator hence it was added to various building material, automotive and other industries. So what\u2019s the big deal with asbestos?? When the products containing asbestos are disturbed (broken, burnt, destroyed etc) the tiny asbestos fibres are released in the air. When inhaled, <em>they can become trapped in the lungs for many many years! This can lead to serious health problems such as asbestosis, mesothelioma, and lung cancer.</em></p>\n<p>Where can asbestos be found?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u00a0Sprayed on fire proofing and insulation in buildings</li>\n<li>Insulation for pipes and boilers</li>\n<li>Wall and ceiling insulation</li>\n<li>Ceiling tiles</li>\n<li>Floor tiles</li>\n<li>Putties, caulks, and cements (such as in chemical carrying cement pipes)</li>\n<li>Roofing shingles</li>\n<li>Siding shingles on old residential buildings</li>\n<li>Wall and ceiling texture in older buildings and homes</li>\n<li>Joint compound in older buildings and homes</li>\n<li>Plasters</li>\n<li>Brake linings and clutch pads</li>\n</ul>\n<p>* this listing is not complete</p>\n<p>Other causes of mesothelioma include: <strong>Zeolites, Radiation</strong> (exposure to high doses of radiation to the chest or\u00a0abdomen\u00a0or after injections of thorium dioxide (<em>Thorotrast</em>), a material used by doctors in some chest X-rays until the 1950s,) <strong>SV40 virus</strong> (simian virus 40) and <strong>Genetics.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Symptoms</strong></p>\n<p>The main symptoms of mesothelioma of the lungs are shortness of breath and\u00a0chest pain.</p>\n<p>Symptoms of abdominal mesothelioma can include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Weight\u00a0loss</li>\n<li>Swelling and\u00a0pain in the abdomen</li>\n<li>Blood clotting abnormalities</li>\n<li>Bowel obstruction</li>\n<li>Anemia</li>\n<li>Fever</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If cancer has spread to other parts of the body, symptoms may include pain, swallowing difficulties, or swelling of the neck or face.</p>\n<p>Since these symptoms are common conditions of other diseases, you should contact your local health physician first before you come to conclusions by yourself.</p>\n<p><strong>Prevention</strong></p>\n<p>Since asbestos is the biggest risk factor of mesothelioma, <em>avoiding or limiting exposure to asbestos</em> is the best way to prevent it.<br />\nPeople who might be exposed to high levels of asbestos at work include some miners, factory workers, insulation manufacturers and installers, railroad and automotive workers, ship builders, gas mask manufacturers, and construction workers.\u00a0<em>Wearing protective gear</em> is way to avoid it. <em>Washing the equipment</em> and clothing and other items used around asbestos is another way to avoid contact.<br />\nOlder homes may have insulation containing asbestos or other materials. A knowledgeable person in the field should be able to check your home or building for asbestos and they can get rid of it. Also, you should avoid drilling or refurbishing older houses without an expert in case they may contain asbestos.</p>\n<p><strong>Cure</strong></p>\n<p>While mesothelioma may be curable in its early stages, in the later stages it is not. (According to the specialist). However there is a<em> treatment plan which includes chemotherapy and can lead to removal of the organ.</em> This treatment plan may extend life expectancy and provide a better quality of life.<br />\nTreating this disease is very very expensive! Mesothelioma surgery can cost around $40000 and the chemotherapy can cost around $30000. That is almost <em>$100000</em>. So the ultimate cure is by far, prevention!</p>\n<p>Check yourself today to see if you are being exposed to asbestos, you DO NOT want to be a victim of mesothelioma!!</p>\n<p>You can learn more about mesothelioma and asbestos on\u00a0<a title=\"http://www.mesothelioma.com/\" href=\"http://www.mesothelioma.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.mesothelioma.com/</a></p>\n<p>Do you know anyone who suffered this disease??

Here is a list of simple virtues that can make our lives happier.</p>\n<p>1) <strong>Patience &#8211;\u00a0</strong>patience is the ability and willingness to restrain anger, annoyance, irritation and provocation. How is this a\u00a0simple trait that will make you happier? Having patience ensures that you do not lose your temper easily. You do not get extremely angry and &#8216;cuss down&#8217; those who angered you. It\u00a0entails that you take some time to understand the situation before you react with the first thought that comes to mind. You can save lots of relationships and prevent yourself from becoming angry too often. It gives you time to calm down and breathe before dealing with the situation in an effective manner.</p>\n<p>2) <b>Compassion &#8211;\u00a0</b>Compassion is the feeling of empathy and understanding of someone&#8217;s misfortune, accompanied by the desire the alleviate their pain. The first steps in being compassionate is understanding the pain of others and realizing that they are suffering and need your help. The second step is to act on it and actually help. You can help in many ways such as taking action or just listening to their story. This trait will allow you to be beneficial to others by offering your support. In turn, the happiness and joy\u00a0you will receive from knowing that you brightened someone&#8217;s day or removed or reduced their trouble is immensely satisfying.</p>\n<p>3)\u00a0<strong>Acceptance &#8211;\u00a0</strong>Acceptance should be a part of life for everyone. This entails not judging people based on colour, size, religion, race, looks or anything at all. It is about being kind to everyone, not just those who are like you. You will meet many different people in your life in school, workplace, social gatherings, family events even, and if you choose to only associate with a certain group of people then you are limiting yourself to many things. Accepting people for who they are instead of judging them or trying to change them will increase your happiness level because you are not spending time doing negative things such as judging but you are sharing your kindness, love, care and appreciation to everyone regardless of anything they may be.</p>\n<p>4) <strong>Forgiveness &#8211;\u00a0</strong>Ever heard of the phrase &#8216; forgive because you need peace not because of someone needs forgiveness&#8217; ? Well it&#8217;s true. It is better to forgive that to waste your time being hurt, regretful and angry. Hating on someone else because of something they did to you will only consume your time and your life. You get nothing out of that. You need to forgive them so that you can move on, release the burdens and find peace. Forgiveness will definitely give you lots of peace of mind and ease. Read this for more on forgiveness\u00a0<a title=\"http://aminellie.wordpress.com/2014/04/29/forgive-because-you-deserve-peace/\" href=\"http://aminellie.wordpress.com/2014/04/29/forgive-because-you-deserve-peace/\" target=\"_blank\">http://aminellie.wordpress.com/2014/04/29/forgive-because-you-deserve-peace/</a>\u00a0.</p>\n<p>5)\u00a0<strong>Encouragement &#8211;\u00a0</strong>encouragement is is the act of giving support, confidence or hope. This simple act can do wonders to a person. Encouraging someone to fulfill a purpose, chase a dream, or even get up each day can change that person&#8217;s life forever. A simple inspirational quote or hug or smile even; this can immensely turn around someone&#8217;s day and make them feel better about themselves and realize that they are worthy. By doing this you are restoring faith and hope in that person and you will also receive satisfaction. You feel good about yourself for helping someone to pursue something or to not give up. You may even feel motivated yourself.</p>\n<p>6)\u00a0<strong>Love &#8211;\u00a0</strong>Everything revolves around love. It is one of the most powerful emotions you can feel. It is important to show love to people especially you children, parents, spouse, siblings, friends and others. Showing love includes being patient, compassionate, accepting, forgiving and encouragement. Being loved makes us feel as though we are worthy, purposeful, and someone special. We should always show love to people because you never know what situation they might be in and a simple act of love can enlighten them. In showing love you get love. When you display a loving character you will seem approachable and friendly so you will not be shunned or hated on. Loving the people around you will get you a lifetime of happiness , peace and joy.Tell the people you love that you love them often, and let them know that you appreciate them. Just as you want to be loved, so do other people; so do your kids, your spouse, your parents, your friends, random person on the street, wheelchair guy, that creepy dude in work. Show them you love them and let the joy you get from the satisfaction you get from brightening someone&#8217;s day bring you happiness.</p>\n<p>These tips may sound difficult to adopt but to key is trying them one at a time. Try the one you find simplest first and take it in baby steps. It mightn&#8217;t happen today or tomorrow but keep trying until you fully understand these virtues and adopt them in your life. <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)</span> <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)</span></p>\n<p>What virtues do you have that will make life happier??

Either way, everyone&#8217;s kind of in this daze, but not because they don&#8217;t have their bags&#8211;I think it&#8217;s because there&#8217;s always that one big bag that looks kind of old or is a bright gaudy color, that keeps doing laps around the carousel. And so everybody just watches it, licking their lips, half jealous to the point that they consider grabbing it so they have something to go home with, but really you just can&#8217;t help but wonder, &#8220;what&#8217;s that guy doing?&#8221; I know they didn&#8217;t miss the flight &#8217;cause it was full, and it&#8217;s been a half hour, did he get stuck in the lavatory or something, or did he have to finish his in-flight entertainment &#8217;cause he just had to see how <em>Lincoln</em> was going to end. And they couldn&#8217;t have taken someone else&#8217;s bag because there&#8217;s no possible way two pale green corduroy suitcases were ever made. This one was certainly a mistake. Maybe that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s been abandoned. There&#8217;s probably nothing in it. The owner probably just checked it so they could leave it at the airport and not have to deal with it anymore. If I ever try to leave my baggage at an airport like that I&#8217;ll at least have the decency to tape a &#8220;4 Sale&#8221; sign to it so someone else can grab it.</p>\n", "post_id": 1001, "location": false, "date": "04-16-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["[insert important search terms/keywords here]", "author", "quote", "writer", "intention", "important", "speaker", "English", "history"], "text": "<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something about quotation marks that makes something you said seem more important than you thought it would be.&#8221;</p>\n", "post_id": 1006, "location": false, "date": "04-17-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["and", "criticism", "unhealthy", "a", "lie", "have", "dessert", "is", "analize", "it", "critic", "eat", "joke humor", "you look fine hunny", "does this joke make me look fat?", "laugh", "cake", "comedy", "your", "blurb", "too"], "text": "<p>Analyzing a joke is like telling someone cake is unhealthy.

You got different income brackets, demographics, different jobs, and even having so many &#8216;communities&#8217; and subcultures can bunch us up and put us in little boxes. I mean, I get it &#8212; it&#8217;s understandable that we want to be with similar people with similar interests, because that makes us comfortable, but at the same time we shouldn\u2019t feel uncomfortable or out of place if we hop in another box.</p>\n<p>Whether we like it or not, we (people) love comparing. So we got all these boxes that we&#8217;ve put our selves in, and so naturally we put them on this &#8216;existential shelf&#8217; and start saying &#8220;this box is better, that one sucks,&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m not on the bottom shelf,&#8221; &#8220;Why is the top shelf way less crowded than the bottom? That&#8217;s not fair!&#8221; So then we start clawing our way to the top, pulling others down, biting ankles, stabbing backs, and the worst part is some actually succeed, however most will fail, and it becomes this big race we&#8217;ve made it out to be, and&#8230;</p>\n<p>We just need to slow down.</p>\n<p>There is no race.

Just imagine if you did&#8211;for real. Everyone would have to stop what they\u2019re doing and eat it. Big wig business executives in a board meeting, gang bangers meeting up on a street corner, soccer moms buzzing from place to place to place; everyone would stop, look around and see that everyone else has ice cream too. We <em>are</em> all on the same level. We might like different flavors and have our own unique way of eating our favorite cup or cone, but everyone likes ice cream. Relax.

They could have done so much more.&#8221; Post a 6 second video on Vine: &#8220;Wow. Look what they did with only 6 seconds!&#8221;<br />\nIt&#8217;s funny how something like Vine can take off so rapidly. Youtube and video sharing has been around for quite some time. Have our attention spans gotten shorter, or are we just more efficient about filling our down time with entertaining snippets and having the ability to share them with anyone around the world with the touch of a screen?<br />\n&#8230;or is there an artist in everyone?<br />\nI&#8217;ve come to notice, through personal experience, as well as impersonal experience, that if you place a creative person in a big open room and tell them &#8220;you can do whatever you want as long as you reach the wall,&#8221; they won&#8217;t know what to do. They&#8217;ll start with an idea and walk one direction, like that band, and then maybe get another idea of equal merit and head off in another direction because &#8220;it might be worth exploring.&#8221; that phrase is the sappy goop that bogs you down.<br />\nFrom an artistic/creative point of view, literally everything is worth exploring, which gives you no better reason to go one way over the other. But the artist doesn&#8217;t know that, so they run around in circles going from one place to the next, running toward the wall, but never reaching it because they obtain this strange sense of empathy with the wall, that by touching one part of the wall they are also not touching every other point on the wall, and thus the artist is not living up to their potential.<br />\nThe metaphor isn&#8217;t perfect, but it&#8217;s like an ant wandering around in search of food. It doesn&#8217;t know where it is, so it could be anywhere, so the ant goes anywhere. It cannot go everywhere &#8212; that is impossible &#8212; but the point is not to go everywhere. The point is to go somewhere. This is where Vine comes back into the equation.<br />\nWhat every artist needs, and may not be willing to admit, are restrictions. Restrictions are what force you to move with undoubting purpose. Restrictions are what force you to think creatively.\u00a0The most common restriction we have are deadlines, and then of course you can go from there. Some people complain about them &#8220;&#8230;Ugh, and the whole thing has to fit on a 6&#215;6 inch space! Can you believe that?&#8221; Yes. Yes, I certainly can. I enjoy these little restrictions because they provide a challenge, but even better yet, they provide a direction and get your mind to tick a way it wasn&#8217;t ticking before. Whether you like it or not, that&#8217;s called being creative. So as is the case with this whole sicks second video Vine thing, people might not know how to express their thoughts in video form about something &#8216;trivial&#8217; that may be very funny or insightful, but doesn&#8217;t warrant &#8216;a whole video just for that.&#8217; But then a 6 second restriction comes along, and here you are thinking about how can you condense your rambling, yet insightful, thoughts on breakfast cereal into a succinct and witty snippet. And best of all is when people normally wouldn&#8217;t do something creative, now feel as though they have an outlet for it that didn&#8217;t exist before, so they start making videos. It&#8217;s not that videos didn&#8217;t exist, but rather that that way of thinking about videos hadn&#8217;t existed to them yet.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Get from A to B.&#8221;<br />\n&#8220;Okay, I&#8217;ll just walk.&#8221;<br />\n&#8220;Between A and B is all water.&#8221;<br />\n&#8220;I&#8217;ll take a bote.&#8221;<br />\n&#8220;You need to get there in 3 seconds.&#8221;<br />\n&#8220;I&#8217;ll take a jet powered hydrofoil.&#8221;<br />\n&#8220;Now that&#8217;s something I want to see.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t really know where I&#8217;m going with this, as I don&#8217;t know why I started writing it, but for some reason I want to end on the image of the wandering ant, and then you put a piece of food in that room and the ant heads straight for it.

So why does all pop music sound the same? Most songs have a predictable chord structure, layout, and constant bass beating through the song, and for the most part, these song get stuck in your head whether you like it or not. Maybe it&#8217;s because those things are what we &#8216;like&#8217; to listen to, or rather, are intrinsically appealing to the ear. But it feels as though that&#8217;s not it because I know I don&#8217;t like a lot of that music. Granted, some of the songs are catchy, but I end up forgetting them a week after I hear them, and then society forgets them as well and moves on to the next thing. Could it be that the music &#8216;industry&#8217; is just trying to play to our tastes? What is the musical taste of our culture; or maybe a better question would be, what is the &#8216;average&#8217; musical taste so we can sell the most albums? I&#8217;m guessing the average musical taste sounds something like what all the pop music sounds like right now. It&#8217;s a safe choice, and usually something with a constant beat throughout so you can play the song at your local club. If you can&#8217;t grind along to a song, what good is it?</p>\n<p>It seems like music nowadays is like two high schoolers in their first relationship, where you try and say all the right things and be super supportive of one another, and everything&#8217;s fine and dandy because you&#8217;re doing what you&#8217;re <em>supposed</em>\u00a0to be doing. The producers are trying to guess what we like, and we&#8217;re eating it up and saying we like it, even though a lot of artists don&#8217;t even write their own stuff, and we end up not liking it, but still listening to it. Neither party is willing to admit that this is all very fabricated and this is not how things should be in the music world because it&#8217;s not very real. It seems like once the artists are famous and rich, they wouldn&#8217;t need to sell out any more just to make an extra buck. I guess greed is a powerful thing; and very subtle.

Because the taller you get, the easier it seems to snap in half in the middle of a storm, or lose your roots in a flood. Why not reach a modest, respectable height, and stop? Are you really going to benefit from being taller if you just keep dropping branches along the way? They are what built you up in the first place, so how do you think that makes them feel? You sacrifice what you consider to be dead weight just so you can sprout a few more leaves closer to the sun.</p>\n<p>What I liked about this painting is that it didn&#8217;t show the tops of the trees.

These two residents were not the only people on this island, but they lived alone. The residents were both on a schedule, both lived through their days as a series of habits, and were both looking for love (trust me. I&#8217;m an omniscient narrator). They both worked hard and found comfort in a solid routine as the foundation for a &#8216;good life,&#8217; and thus were both bound by their schedules &#8212; &#8220;imprisoned&#8221; might be a better word.</p>\n<p>A unique feature of this island is that it was a perfect circle with a sidewalk that hugged the perimeter. There were twelve equally spaced streets radiating from a where a big clock tower stood in the heart of the town. You could keep track of the time from almost anywhere on the island, as our two residents would frequently do.</p>\n<p>You see, even time is man-made. Not the concept of time, but how we choose to restrict ourselves with it. Seconds. Hours. Years &#8212; don&#8217;t tell me nothing lasts forever. I don&#8217;t want to hear it.</p>\n<p>Every morning these two residents would wake up at the same time, step onto the same sidewalk, turn right, and walk clockwise until they came back to where they started. Their schedules wove together like two gears &#8212; however, they lived on opposite sides of the island and always walked clockwise at the same time. What these two residents didn&#8217;t realize, and would never come to realize, is that this ordinary, scheduled walk was so precise, so routine, and so expected, that the absence of anticipation surrounding it drew about as much attention to the walk as you will give to your next breath, which is extraordinary. Extraordinarily dull.</p>\n<p>It is still unclear to me, the omniscient narrator, whether the two residents scheduled to walk each morning, or whether they walked because the schedule told them to. Of course, the residents think to be in complete control, and that is why they stick to the schedule &#8212; the sense of order and control &#8212; but from the outside looking in, it seems as if control was simply an illusion created by the predictability of a clock.</p>\n<p>When you do something so much, you don&#8217;t even know what you&#8217;re missing anymore; you just assume it&#8217;s not there.</p>\n<p>Our two residents would wake up every day, go on their clockwise walk, and eventually fall asleep in the same bed they woke up in, and repeated this controlled, scheduled, living habit for so many days that the memories of the past years of this routine congealed into one solitary memory. One day, one of the residents noticed they looked older, felt older, and consequently tried to recall how that happened, but could only come to the conclusion that &#8220;time flies.&#8221; It was at this time, I, the omniscient narrator, decided this resident decided to go for a walk that morning. The same walk as always, but upon this day this resident choose to walk counterclockwise as a gesture of change, as a way to motivate this resident to start breaking the very routine that this resident had resided in for so long.</p>\n<p>It was free. It was clear. It was new. Surely memories would be made on this day as the two residents approached each other around the bend of the man-made island. They were destined to meet. As their paths crossed, they greeted each other with a congenial smile accompanied by a neighborly &#8220;hello,&#8221; and kept on walking down the path without breaking stride, or their respective schedules. A whole history of new possibilities came into existence on that unclockwise walk, and then disappeared as simply as the path on which they walked curved out of sight around the island, and disappeared without the memory of even saying &#8216;goodbye.&#8217;</p>\n", "post_id": 1173, "location": false, "date": "07-04-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["hangry", "organize", "can't we all just get along?", "office", "hunger", "manage", "sustenance", "culture", "pyramid", "chew before you swallow", "file", "respect", "protein", "sugar", "organizing", "ice cream", "society", "management", "self", "people", "avocado", "i'm so hungry", "writing", "balancing act", "vegetable", "folder", "sustainance", "blurb", "life", "pleaser", "gluten", "food", "free", "you are what you eat", "fruit", "diet", "carb", "eat", "balance", "parenting", "compartmentalize", "request", "standards", "work", "apples", "social", "can't we all just get oblong?", "oranges", "norms"], "text": "<p>We can&#8217;t attempt to compartmentalize things in life; put the oranges here, the greens in a separate fridge with a different humidity than the cheese will allow, and give the avocados get their own special fridge.

It even has a handle and a spout. Over the next few weeks you keep using the top half of the blender to eat while the bottom half still sits plugged in on your counter top. No, it still doesn&#8217;t work. And now you&#8217;ve gotten used to it being there that it has just become part of the kitchen counter; a fixture, a statue, a memorial even.

I&#8217;ve never seen a crow have fun before, or any animal for that matter entertain itself while so isolated and unprovoked.</p>\n", "post_id": 1499, "location": false, "date": "11-18-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["crazy", "picture", "photo", "buildings", "brain", "laugh", "comic", "I Can't Draw", "city", "sun", "flash", "sky", "pen", "camera", "skyscraper", "pencil", "head", "funny", "bonus", "photography", "haha", "construction", "tetris", "line", "panel", "photograph", "tetriminos", "windows", "double", "industry", "whiteboard", "person", "skyline", "silly", "joke", "deconstruction", "block"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://allmostrelevant.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/skyline.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1497\" alt=\"skyline\" src=\"https://allmostrelevant.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/skyline.png?w=1024&#038;h=835\"   /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 1503, "location": false, "date": "11-19-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["ad", "campaign", "photo", "executive", "idea", "agent", "packaging", "deadline", "result", "laugh", "comic", "I Can't Draw", "procrastinating", "blue", "funny", "humor", "flash", "writing", "board", "meeting", "picture", "product", "nabisco", "marketing", "photography", "haha", "creatives", "pressure", "pun", "panel", "photograph", "room", "joke", "stupid", "advertising", "drawing"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://allmostrelevant.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/salmonilla-wafers.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1506\" alt=\"salmonilla wafers\" src=\"https://allmostrelevant.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/salmonilla-wafers.png?w=1024&#038;h=724\"   /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 1505, "location": false, "date": "11-20-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["detective", "holmes", "tallahassee", "show", "wit", "sherlock", "elementary", "table", "comic", "I Can't Draw", "mercury", "humor", "tv", "hydrogen", "sassafrassy", "acting", "discovery", "meme", "pun", "elements", "holmie. holm boy", "carbon", "sassy", "oxygen", "joke", "sidekick", "tree", "watson", "periodic", "silly", "science", "fun", "chemistry"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://allmostrelevant.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/elementree.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1509\" alt=\"elementree\" src=\"https://allmostrelevant.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/elementree.png?w=1024&#038;h=685\"   /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 1508, "location": false, "date": "11-20-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["love", "photo", "one", "patience", "clinic", "comic", "research", "I Can't Draw", "funny", "death", "humor", "decay", "not funny", "flash", "patients", "alzheimers", "writing", "add", "camera", "it's a joke don't kill me please", "frustration", "memory", "nurse", "board", "hospital", "picture", "life", "appointment", "fade", "schedule", "photography", "phone", "bulb", "sad", "white", "panel", "loss", "term", "remember", "lost", "joke", "doctor", "disease", "connection", "disappointment", "happy", "drawing"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://allmostrelevant.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/alzheimers-clinic.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1512\" alt=\"alzheimer's clinic\" src=\"https://allmostrelevant.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/alzheimers-clinic.png?w=1024&#038;h=952\"   /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 1511, "location": false, "date": "11-21-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["all", "deep", "derp", "soul", "writing", "story", "death", "would", "travel", "should", "achieve", "life", "food", "quote", "all you can eat", "buffet", "meaning", "accomplish", "adventure", "cycle", "a", "chronological", "success", "could", "hungry", "thought", "journey", "karma", "time", "existential", "soul food"], "text": "<p>&#8220;Life is a buffet line where you can&#8217;t go back for seconds.&#8221;</p>\n", "post_id": 1517, "location": false, "date": "11-22-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>Today&#8217;s suggestion was &#8216;Sobering Up.&#8217; I will be taking suggestions for running commentary from now on as I have nothing interesting to talk about, but other people seem to, and I will do my best to use every suggestion. The one restriction is the suggestion must be either <strong>one word</strong>, or a<strong>\u00a0phrase</strong>, like &#8216;sobering up.&#8217; This is less writing and more just thinking and roaming around my mind with little or no sense of direction. It is my mind, so things will be addressed from my point of view, with my thoughts. <strong>This is a conversation.\u00a0</strong>Ask follow up questions, disagree, contribute, or just leave a suggestion below and I&#8217;ll make it happen&#8230; Anything. Literally: anything.</p>\n<p>Sobering up for me is a tricky, if not impossible task, due to the fact that I don&#8217;t drink. I am of legal age, and have never really considered that the reason to, or to not, drink, but it was the cop-out excuse when people offered me drinks when I was under 21. The real reason I don&#8217;t drink is because it tastes like piss. If someone took a beer into the bathroom and came out I&#8217;d feel obligated to make a wise crack about the coincidental color of his beverage. People tell me &#8220;you&#8217;ll get used to the taste&#8221; or &#8220;once you start drinking you don&#8217;t even notice it&#8221; or &#8220;you don&#8217;t drink it for the taste.&#8221; That sets me off on a few directions&#8230;</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll get used to the taste.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t understand the trouble with acquired tastes. Why would you want to acquire a taste? It tastes bad, but everyone else likes it, so you just say you aren&#8217;t sophisticated enough yet, and keep chugging away until your as sophisticated as a motherfucker. It tastes bad now. Nothing will change once I&#8217;ve acquired the taste &#8212; except now it tastes okay. Something had to change. Then it must have been me. My theory is drinking shit piss beer and wine tastes awful, but you have a great time because you get to be silly and &#8216;lose&#8217; your inhibitions. I just think alcohol is just an excuse to do things you want to do anyways, or act how you want to around people without feeling bad, or god-forbid; awkward. Sociologist or Psychologists or one of those professions followed a bunch of different college students on their spring break trips to beachy places south of the border and caught some girls, who were completely sober, go around and act drunk and do stupid drunkie things just to fill that little space in their minds that tells them what they don&#8217;t want to hear. I&#8217;ve had a few drinks before, and I&#8217;m not completely talking out of my ass here, but I was pretty much the same after a few drinks. The only main difference is I didn&#8217;t ever think about where my hands were (not in\u00a0<em>that</em> way you perverts). It just seems like people are ashamed that their base instincts are raucous and loathsome, and their searching for an excuse to set them free. Personally, I have no trouble being stupid without alcohol, so I can&#8217;t really use any excuses, and don&#8217;t want to taste them either. So if you hand me a drink and ask me how it tastes, I might respond, &#8220;tastes like an excuse,&#8221; and you&#8217;ll think I&#8217;m being an asshole.</p>\n<p>Once you start drinking you don&#8217;t even notice it.</p>\n<p>What I&#8217;m wondering is what are you noticing now that&#8217;s more important than swallowing piss? Do you want to be deaf or blind? If the answer is no, then why do you want to be numb? I don&#8217;t have a good answer to that question, and until I do, I&#8217;m not drinking. If I can&#8217;t taste my own excuses, know they&#8217;re there, then I&#8217;m no longer aware of myself, and thus my effect on my surroundings. Personally, I am a very aware person. Sometimes I act like I&#8217;m not just so the people around the corner, or whispering, don&#8217;t get paranoid around me. It&#8217;s not so bad if you let people know you can hear them talking &#8216;out of earshot;&#8217; but when you keep letting them know, well then nobody says anything interesting anymore.</p>\n<p>You don&#8217;t drink it for the taste.</p>\n<p>Well then what do you drink it for? Yourself, or for others? Are you really that miserable of a person to be around that you need to drink to make others enjoy you? Are you really that miserable of a person that you need to drink so you can be happy with yourself? Is a party not fun unless there&#8217;s alcohol? Do you think I&#8217;m full of shit and just need to chill out and have a beer because I don&#8217;t understand anything? Honestly, I don&#8217;t care what the answers to any of those questions are as long as you regret nothing and stand by your choices. If you like drinking; great. Drink. Drink with confidence &#8212; just don&#8217;t talk about it the day after as if you didn&#8217;t mean to or you shouldn&#8217;t have or like you are regretting it for the seventeenth consecutive weekend.</p>\n<p>So on the topic of &#8216;Sobering Up,&#8217; now I&#8217;m thinking about &#8220;what do I need to sober up from.&#8221; Everyone&#8217;s got problems. That&#8217;s life lesson number one. But not everyone knows it&#8230; That&#8217;s a life lesson for another day.</p>\n", "post_id": 152, "location": false, "date": "03-27-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags":

I suppose this is why people like this word, or when little youngsters first learn it they can help but repeat it all the time because it&#8217;s a fun word to say. Why say undoubtedly when you can say indubitably? Why eat vegetables when you can eat veggies? Why become a homeless child when you could become a ragamuffin?\u00a0Indubitably, the indubitability of sillier words, when heard, can spur the familiar smirk and smile, or spark the occasional wit and guile.</p>\n", "post_id": 158, "location": false, "date": "03-27-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["tomb-stoners", "generation", "yolo", "blarg", "feet", "ironic", "comic", "I Can't Draw", "funny", "death", "humor", "six", "live", "only", "epitaph", "toll", "tombstone", "you", "life", "cemetary", "marketing", "under", "free", "adventure", "why", "grave", "target", "james", "twice", "stupid", "silly", "advertising", "joke", "y", "once", "dare", "bond"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://allmostrelevant.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/yolo.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1578\" alt=\"YOLO\" src=\"https://allmostrelevant.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/yolo.png?w=1024&#038;h=710\"   /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 1580, "location": false, "date": "12-11-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["udders", "ringer", "move", "neigh", "one", "thanks", "comic", "I Can't Draw", "horse", "beef", "movie", "flash", "sky", "hey", "spots", "hay", "camera", "nay", "pun", "farm", "welcome", "haha", "moving", "sun", "panel", "land", "cow", "joke", "country", "heighborhood", "grass", "heehee"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://allmostrelevant.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/neighborhood.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1584\" alt=\"NEIGHborhood\" src=\"https://allmostrelevant.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/neighborhood.png?w=1024&#038;h=623\"   /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 1582, "location": false, "date": "12-12-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["photo", "strip", "dudes", "bro", "intenstine casings... yum!", "polish", "comic", "I Can't Draw", "fot", "funny", "sausage", "festival", "doodle", "toomanydudes", "eraser", "brautwurst", "party", "tubular meats", "picture", "pun", "spicy", "catsup", "food", "photography", "facepalm", "fest", "frat", "braut", "ketchup", "balloon", "condiments", "carnival", "German", "whiteboard", "dog", "silly", "drawing"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://allmostrelevant.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/sausage-fest.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1583\" alt=\"sausage fest\" src=\"https://allmostrelevant.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/sausage-fest.png?w=1024&#038;h=685\"   /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 1586, "location": false, "date": "12-13-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["late", "pun", "i need to get my shit together here", "bunny", "resolution", "unnaturally happy", "year", "happy", "drawing", "teg", "so late", "punny bunny", "rabbit", "too happy", "new", "comic", "one", "I Can't Draw", "cartoon", "panel"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://allmostrelevant.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/hoppy-new-year.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1590\" alt=\"hoppy new year\" src=\"https://allmostrelevant.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/hoppy-new-year.png?w=1024&#038;h=766\"   /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 1588, "location": false, "date": "01-06-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["feed", "ugh", "art", "fence", "lion", "kfc", "comic", "writing", "I Can't Draw", "chicken", "funny", "humor", "zoo", "food", "pun", "read", "bear", "implicity", "tiger", "joke", "lines", "bad", "silly"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://allmostrelevant.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/lions.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1589\" alt=\"lions\" src=\"https://allmostrelevant.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/lions.png?w=1024&#038;h=805\"   /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 1592, "location": false, "date": "01-07-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["pun", "silly", "garage", "farside", "speachless", "meh", "whatever", "misunderstanding", "guitar", "band", "music", "oops", "drums", "keyboard", "sun", "comic", "one", "I Can't Draw", "panel"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://allmostrelevant.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/keyboard.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1599\" alt=\"keyboard\" src=\"https://allmostrelevant.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/keyboard.png?w=1024&#038;h=641\"   /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 1598, "location": false, "date": "01-08-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["art", "garbage", "confuse", "through", "BS", "writing", "out", "hipsters", "diction", "thorough", "fight", "window", "frustration", "inside joke", "life", "dictionary", "defenestration", "meaning", "wtf", "throw", "thrown", "definition", "windows 7"], "text": "<p>When I hear &#8220;defenestration,&#8221; I think of two things. 1: Frustration, because it goes well with defenestration; eg: &#8220;it&#8217;s frustrating that auto-correct thinks defenestration is a word while defenestrate is not.

Fire is another good analogy for something that can start small and grow and grow and grow, but how often does something keep growing forever? I can&#8217;t really think of anything, which is why I like the snowball effect. You have to control fire to keep it from spreading. Fire spreads on it&#8217;s own and doesn&#8217;t take any effort. I&#8217;ve never seen an idea spread on it&#8217;s own. You need people to spread ideas and you need people to have ideas in the first place.</p>\n<p>You can&#8217;t put an idea in a museum.</p>\n<p>Think about a snowball. You scoop up snow from the ground and pack it into a ball. It takes some molding, shaping, and effort to pack it into a tight ball, because if you don&#8217;t it will fall apart. Now look at the ground. There&#8217;s a bare spot. You took that snow and turned it into something else. You used that resource, you took advantage of that opportunity, you gained experience, you made a connection, you learned something, you became stronger, you became more successful&#8230;</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s still plenty of snow on the ground so you scoop up a few more handfuls and make your snowball bigger. It&#8217;s now big enough for you to push it along the ground and pick up more and more snow, constantly building and improving upon what you already have. You approach a hill and see someone at the bottom trying to gather as much snow as they can, too, by making snowball after snowball, perpetually starting and starting over. They use up all the snow around them and try to move to a new area to gather more snow, but they can&#8217;t carry all the snowballs. They can only take a few in their arms so they become removed from their snowballs as they must move to start over. You watch them repeat this cycle a few times until they&#8217;ve left piles and trails of snowballs showing where they&#8217;ve been, yet they only have a few snowballs in hand to show for it. They have as much snow as you&#8211;maybe even more&#8211;but they can&#8217;t do anything with it.</p>\n<p>The beauty of the snowball effect is that you need help. You need people.</p>\n<p>You push your snowball down the hill and it gains speed, picking up snow as it goes, growing into something too big for one person to manage, and it breaks under its own weight. It cracks and splits into several large pieces. You waive to the person you had been watching and they come over and start rounding out the rough edges and patching up your fractured snowballs with their little ones, filling in the holes until they are round again. Like them, you initially bit off more than you could chew. You carry on, both pushing your new snowballs along, gathering more and more until the load becomes too much and must be shared by yet another, and so on, and so on.</p>\n<p>Keep building &#8212; experience, networking, resources, success, knowledge, opportunities &#8212; keep building upon what you have until you can&#8217;t build anymore, before the other part of the snowball effect takes over&#8230;</p>\n<p>melting.</p>\n", "post_id": 1613, "location": false, "date": "01-28-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["all", "scrape", "touch", "hate", "death", "religion", "only thing", "explain", "to", "bliss", "worth", "hope", "choice", "life is art", "worst", "know", "trouble", "feeble", "color", "success", "artist", "die", "summary", "try", "oblivion", "release", "claw", "fault", "triumph", "art", "creator", "deaf", "malice", "alive", "immortal", "see", "desperate", "fail", "best", "what", "god", "everything", "surprise", "we", "latin", "christian", "sins", "possibility", "obligation", "bleed", "last", "anything", "of", "experience", "thing", "defeat", "first", "blind", "love", "feel", "hear", "christianity", "pointless", "wrath", "jealousy", "fight", "breath", "opus", "live", "fraction", "listen", "breathe", "dialogue", "stars", "heal", "huh", "failure", "ignorant", "hold", "me", "us", "supposed", "atheist", "happy", "vicarious", "give", "agnostic", "life", "sad", "guarantee", "different", "creater", "deadly", "same", "how", "amazing", "magnum", "you", "creature", "who", "meaning", "nothing", "opportunity", "why", "forever", "i", "light", "conquer", "greed"], "text": "<p>Art is so pointless sometimes. Don&#8217;t you think with all the thinking that artists have done over the years that we would have figured out the meaning of life by now?</p>\n<p>You know what I think about the meaning of life?</p>\n<p>What?</p>\n<p>Why would God create us if we are going to die? But not really even that. Why would God create us with the capacity of knowing we&#8217;re going to die? Why couldn&#8217;t he just have made us live forever? Or at least make us unaware of what death is? That&#8217;d save me a lot of trouble. I&#8217;d be happy. But you know what? Have you ever seen anything amazing come from an ignorant creature? I don&#8217;t think so. Ignorance isn&#8217;t bliss, because without knowing what dark is you can&#8217;t know what light is. Without down there&#8217;s no up. It&#8217;s like explaining color to a blind person. Live forever? That&#8217;s not the way to go. It&#8217;s in the struggle, the fight of knowing that we are going to die, and having the choice to give it our all and fight, and fight, and scrape and crawl and bleed; fight until there is nothing left in us, until we are everything we wanted to be, or become everything we hate, until we see the light and release our last breath saying, &#8220;That was all of me. That was everything. That was my magnum opus.&#8221; It is that fight that brings out the worst in us, the absolute worst of desperation, greed, malice, jealousy, and wrath. And it is that same fight that we can triumph, love, heal, conquer and live. LIVE. Really live&#8230; and that&#8217;s what makes it worth it. That&#8217;s what makes life worth living. That&#8217;s why we are alive. That&#8217;s why we were created. But do no mistake the <i>possibility</i> of life with real life. Do not mistake defeat for death, and hope for triumph. It is a fight. Nothing is guaranteed. Many will fail, and many will succeed, but one thing for certain is that all of us will die. You don&#8217;t need me to tell you this. It&#8217;s not a surprise. You know it&#8217;s coming, and so we are left, not even with the choices we make, but just one choice: Will you fight? Will you fight? Will you live?</p>\n<p>But why don&#8217;t artists just say that? Why does it take them their whole life to figure that out, or maybe even never figure that out?</p>\n<p>That IS the art. Art cannot be summarized or broken down or paraphrased without its meaning being summarized, broken down, and paraphrased as well. Art can&#8217;t be explained; it has to be experienced. How do you hear music for someone else? You can&#8217;t. How do you taste a delicious treat for someone else? You can&#8217;t. How are you supposed to live for someone else? You can&#8217;t. I could tell you the meaning of life, but it wouldn&#8217;t be the meaning of your life. It takes a lifetime of experiences to understand the meaning of life. Not just the meaning of any life; the meaning of your life. Life is the art, and art is life. We cannot live for someone else, but we struggle to, we try to pour our soul into art so that someone might feel a glimpse of the same thing we felt, live a fraction of our lives, and thus keep us alive through art. We don&#8217;t need to live. We don&#8217;t need to think. We don&#8217;t <em>need</em> to do anything; so I ask you this: why <i>do</i> we? &#8230;Your life is art, and you are the meaning of life.</p>\n", "post_id": 1618, "location": false, "date": "02-01-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["motivation", "work", "art", "just", "picture", "money", "carpe", "it", "dead", "society", "ahhhhhh", "busy", "goal", "desperation", "paint", "much", "too", "do", "poets", "i'm done", "quote", "diem", "i'm just... done", "scrawling", "*gasp* he said the 'fuck' word!", "nike", "stuff", "time", "wit's end", "drawing"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://allmostrelevant.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/carpe-diem.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1627\" alt=\"carpe diem\" src=\"https://allmostrelevant.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/carpe-diem.png?w=1024&#038;h=856\"   /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 1626, "location": false, "date": "02-21-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["katy", "apple", "galaxy", "perry", "acknowledge", "lol", "cell", "music", "landline", "android", "blurb", "iphone", "omg", "i am a stolen car", "song", "eminem", "phone", "stolen", "samsung", "car", "alarm", "dinosaur", "popular"], "text": "<p>Car alarms are like having a landline.

Saying anything else that hints at &#8220;no&#8221; is just delaying the inevitable. Sure, they&#8217;ll be disappointed, but you are saying &#8220;don&#8217;t be disappointed now; wait until I&#8217;m gone.&#8221; And that&#8217;s how relationships are ruined, because then you give yourself distance between you and that person, knowing that the farther away from them, the more comfortable you feel. But what you didn&#8217;t realize is that the closer you are to them, the more uncomfortable you feel, so when you think about connecting with them again you start to feel uncomfortable, and when, or even if, you are around them again it just feels weird. All because you couldn&#8217;t just say no in the first place. I&#8217;m not just talking romantic relationships either; any relationship where two people are involved. And what you didn&#8217;t realize is that you now have taught yourself the closer you are to that person, the more uncomfortable you feel.</p>\n<p>I kind of get it. I mean, I&#8217;ve always gotten that concept, but for some reason I just keep falling in the same trap. Like, it doesn&#8217;t matter that I know junk food is bad for me; I keep eating it.</p>\n<p>you treat other people the way that you want to be treated. You don&#8217;t want to hurt them, but you have to think about the long term. That&#8217;s what makes a good leader; for others to follow, and for yourself to follow. How would you like it if someone led you on and dragged you down a rocky path before finally letting go?</p>\n<p>I hate it.</p>\n<p>Okay&#8230; Well you need to see that. It takes bravery and courage to tell someone &#8220;no,&#8221; and to know that you most likely will disappoint them in the short term, but it is, without a doubt, better in the long run. It always is.</p>\n<p>Time heals all wounds, right?</p>\n<p>Yup.

Like, the &#8216;speed of thought.&#8217; Everything is relative (is viewed in a context), and basically you have to filter all of your experiences through your mind in order to even experience them, so from the inside looking out, the whole world is in your mind (&#8220;it&#8217;s all in your head&#8221;). If you&#8217;re stumped on a problem or worrying about something, time may pass very slowly whereas if you&#8217;re just having fun and just enjoying the moment, or to exaggerate, if you&#8217;re sleeping, then time will pass very rapidly. If you dream than you spend more time being asleep. Thinking more slows down time whereas simply reacting skips over time. People have said regarding crazy moments that &#8220;it was like slow motion. I never thought it was going to end.&#8221; And conversely there exists &#8220;driving hypnosis&#8221; where you end up at your destination in the blink of an eye because you are so used to taking the same route that you require zero thought to drive it. This line of thought leads to the creation of memories as what allows us to place ourselves in time. Without any memories, there is no time. Babies do not have memories, and thus have no concept of time (and aren&#8217;t really much alive yet, like, viva la vida etc&#8230;). And they are also really stupid. But on the other end of the spectrum you might have someone with Alzheimer&#8217;s who does not have the ability to create new memories, and is, although it&#8217;s painfully sad to say, pretty much already dead (from their point of view). So the next time you fall into routine, or order the same thing for lunch, or drive the same way home, or do the same activity with your friends, stop&#8230; and think about that. Make a memory.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>EDIT (3/16/14): I came across this video that has a much more informed position than my generalized curiosities.

She moved two miles away and took the dog and all the pictures. She still wanted me, just not him, so they played tug of war until I avoided both of them. I didn\u2019t talk much to anyone after that.</p>\n<p>I got my first cell phone. It was the smallest one in mass production \u2013 smaller was better. It saved numbers on it, but I only called a few and had them memorized. I didn\u2019t feel comfortable calling the numbers I didn\u2019t have committed to memory.</p>\n<p>We always hung out at Tommy\u2019s house because he had an Xbox. If we went elsewhere we\u2019d have to play board games and be wholesome. No one wanted to go to my house. I joked it was like the Middle East. That didn\u2019t go over well with Abdul. He was always \u2018busy\u2019 after that. It was boring playing four-player games with three people, so we grabbed the new kid and showed him how fun virtually killing each other could be. When one of my friends would call, I\u2019d ask if everyone else was available before I committed to make sure there was always three before I became the fourth. Sometimes we\u2019d all be available, but no one would commit, and we&#8217;d stay home in a stalemate.</p>\n<p>I almost kissed a girl. She gave me looks, left me notes, spread friendly rumors, sent me emails, and made me get an instant messaging account. I liked that I didn\u2019t have to put on a show, I just had to write nice things. I think she liked my words more than me, but I couldn\u2019t let her know the idea of me was better than the real me.<br />\nWe learned that sex is bad, and what it can do to you, and what it can do for you. We learned that drugs are bad, and which kinds of drugs are bad, and how they affect us. I saw the quiet kid smoking behind the school. I didn\u2019t say anything.</p>\n<p>New Year\u2019s was at Tommy\u2019s. Video games and sparkling cider kept us up all night and we missed the fireworks. We\u2019ve seen them before and we\u2019ll see them again.</p>\n<p>In high school two middle schools merged and hardly anyone knew me. Sometimes I wouldn\u2019t see any of my friends all day. It was harder to meet people because they didn\u2019t know you unless you were the best at something. I was almost the best at a lot of things. I stopped studying but my grades stayed up. I whined to my friends about having wasted so much of my life studying, and that I could have done so much more. I could\u2019ve been a celebrity. The star of the school play wasn\u2019t the most talented, but he\u2019d put more people in the seats. His understudy ended up getting a full ride for acting.</p>\n<p>My dad remarried after two years off. I didn\u2019t agree to this, but everyone was okay with it like nothing ever happened.</p>\n<p>Our little foursome ended up befriending another group. I didn\u2019t have everyone\u2019s number memorized, but I could just facebook them from my phone if need be. If I wanted to, I could learn everything about someone\u2019s life if all I knew was their face and half their name. Various girls would come and go like the window displays of city department stores, advertising themselves but not wanting to be touched in public. The dress code was whatever was on MTV, and the music just needed a heavy beat to grind on your crush with at the Homecoming dance. The less clothes the better. Our homecoming was informal \u2013 dress up in themed costumes and such. Against traditional tradition, our girls-ask-guys dance was the formal one because we don\u2019t want to be sexist.</p>\n<p>We learned what sex was, how it happens, different ways it can happen, and all the bad things that can happen, and then they told us to be abstinent and gave us condoms. We learned that drugs are bad, how they\u2019re used, where they come from, and how much won\u2019t kill you. We took mental notes.</p>\n<p>Our group became bigger, but hardly anyone knew each other anymore. I felt awkward calling some of the people in the group and texted, emailed, or facebooked them instead. Whenever we wanted to do something, we didn\u2019t just do it; we had to consult the group first. If the group didn\u2019t want to eat at Red Robin on half day Wednesdays, we didn\u2019t eat there so everyone could be happy.</p>\n<p>One weekend the group wanted to go see the newest sequel of the latest remake of an adapted book series. I didn\u2019t want to go. The second most attractive girl in the group rested her hand on my leg during the major plot twist and worked up to her goal by the climax. After the movie I had homework and she had to get up early, so we could escape. She asked if I\u2019d been tested. I asked for what, and then she tutored me on the difference between second and third base. I wouldn&#8217;t have learned that in school. She moved across town and we tried to stay connected, but getting connected is easier than staying connected. My parents had no idea. As long as my grades were up they didn\u2019t care.</p>\n<p>I spent New Year\u2019s with the group. We were all paired off, and enjoying the fireworks. We drank and watched the last ten years blow up in HD around the world.</p>\n", "post_id": 204, "location": false, "date": "04-30-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["6wStory"], "text": "<p>Speakers blare silence; calm, soothing violence.</p>\n", "post_id": 209, "location": false, "date": "04-22-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["6wStory"], "text": "<p>Dr. Seuss slipped through the noose.</p>\n", "post_id": 211, "location": false, "date": "04-29-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["6wStory"], "text": "<p>The mailman stumbled into a trapdoor.</p>\n", "post_id": 213, "location": false, "date": "05-06-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["6wStory"], "text": "<p>\u201cPress on!\u201d he said, turning back.</p>\n", "post_id": 215, "location": false, "date": "05-13-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["short"], "text": "<p>He could hear her manipulating the piano beautifully as he walked up the driveway.

She sighed stubbornly and walked over to a bookshelf in the next room. He followed her on his own terms. \u201cI don\u2019t know whose is what here.\u201d<br />\n\u201cMine are the not-dusty ones. You only bought the cookbooks and romantic comedies \u2013 by the way I can\u2019t stand My Big Fat Greek Wedding.\u201d<br />\n\u201cHere,\u201d she said handing him the red stickers. \u201cYou go through it \u2013 and I didn\u2019t like Zombieland.\u201d<br />\nHe shrugged his shoulders. \u201cNeither did I.\u201d<br />\n\u201cBut you laughed.\u201d<br />\n\u201cSo did you.\u201d He turned to labeling the book collection, and she separated a stack of old postcards in two piles for him and her.<br />\n\u201cDo you have a place yet?\u201d he asked.<br />\nShe hesitated briefly. \u201cI\u2019m living with a friend.\u201d<br />\n\u201cI hope he likes new stuff.\u201d<br />\nShe refused to acknowledge his little smirk, and quit the postcards for the piano, picking up where she left off before he came in. He took his time casually marking the books. She approached the finale of her trademark song, although she\u2019d transposed it to a different key than he remembered. He watched her play, spotting the few blemishes that undermined the overall harmony of the instrument.<br />\nHe tacked a red sticker on the piano and she halted short of the finish line, glaring up at his little smirk.<br />\n\u201cI need to take the piano.\u201d<br />\n\u201cJust \u2018take\u2019 it? It\u2019s our piano.\u201d<br />\n\u201cIt was given to me as a gift.\u201d he said. \u201cIt means a lot to me.\u201d<br />\n\u201cyou don\u2019t even play.

Besides; it\u2019s just a piano, right?

She came back in her PJ\u2019s and sat closer to me than before. I don\u2019t remember what happened next, but she kissed me. Her lips were soft, but slightly cold. She\u2019d just put something on them. She removed my sweatshirt, and we went upstairs &#8212; I wasn\u2019t thinking; not fast enough anyways. She started talking about things I wasn\u2019t familiar with; things she\u2019d do to me, things I\u2019d do to her. I don\u2019t know if she was trying to build up a sense of excitement or anticipation, but the whole thing felt contrived, and I started to feel heavy and deflated. She was such a sweet, pleasant girl five minutes ago.\u00a0I noticed how I didn&#8217;t actually know her. In the scheme of things we\u2019d just met, and here we eagerly are. I wasn&#8217;t ready. I didn&#8217;t know \u201cjumping in bed with someone you didn\u2019t know\u201d was really a real thing. I\u2019d only heard stand-up comedians and business men use it as an expression backstage.</p>\n<p>I told her we shouldn\u2019t do this. I was being Christian and saying that I wanted to be with her, but this wasn\u2019t the way to do it. She said she understood, but really was just disappointed in me. I didn\u2019t know what to think. She acted all nice and Christian everywhere else, but behind closed doors desire and temptation ravished her mind and body. The weird thing is I wanted her too. I wanted to \u2018jump in bed\u2019 with her. The only difference between her and me is that I won\u2019t change who I am behind closed doors just so I can sleep with her; I already did that. Now I\u2019m wondering if she\u2019ll be the same way the next time I see her. I know I\u2019ll still be the same person who won\u2019t take advantage of her; but that\u2019s not me. Is this her? Is she always like this, but changes herself to be more appropriate around others? I hate irony. We would have worked out perfectly if we\u2019d just dropped the act, cut to the chase, and just had fun.</p>\n<p>I suppose I wanted to be righteous and play the \u2018long game.\u2019 I\u2019m in high school for God\u2019s sake; there is no long game. Everyone\u2019s going to move on and start a new life. I only have a chance to find someone in the short term before these people slip out of my life forever. Maybe I should apologize and jump back in bed with her; for old time\u2019s sake. We know who we are underneath the cover of daily life, and we\u2019re okay with each other, but something seems so wrong about it now. Not taboo, like every eye we\u2019ve ever met was watching us; but more like the rollercoaster is just slowing down and waiting to let the people off.</p>\n", "post_id": 27, "location": false, "date": "03-12-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["blurb"], "text": "<p>There has been a huge gaming problem in the library, but the library just banned the use of computers for gaming purposes.

He didn\u2019t need to point or tell me to look over the side as our chair lift sailed over the terrain park. A snowboarder received attention from two ski patrolmen at the foot of a 30 foot tabletop jump with crossed skis on it. He was laid in a sled-type backboard, and stiff. His face matched the red ski patrol jackets, puffed and swollen against the confines of the neck brace, pressing to break free. It reminded me of when a friend from the accelerated program in elementary school put a yellow ducky peep in the microwave. It popped \u2013 but not all at once. The first time I ever saw EMTs is when I was waiting for the principal because I dragged a kid away from a fight. He was calling the peep-popper\u2019s mom to let her know her son had landed on his eye out on the playground. I thought about how that was possible, but the blood and the words \u201cI can\u2019t see! I can\u2019t see!\u201d distracted me. I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong, and now I was the lone audience to <em>The Bleeding-Eye Show</em>. Apparently the EMTs thought in front of the waiting room chairs was the best place to perform. I wasn\u2019t allowed to leave my seat. I can\u2019t remember what the principal told me\u2014probably something about being careful.</p>\n<p>I didn\u2019t talk much to the bloody-eye friend after third grade because he stopped talking. Our teacher explained to keep our distance from him because his mom passed away of cancer. Someone had to ask what \u201cpassed away\u201d meant. I think my motherless friend would have preferred a car crash so he could have someone or something to blame, but instead he had to slowly watch her disappear with his childhood. Nothing provokes life more than death. Now he fights for what he still believes in and cooks his own meals after working hard. I eat out every day and believe in anything because I haven\u2019t learned otherwise. All my experiences have been secondhand, listening to stories of success, failure, and a plethora of examples on \u2018how to be good.\u2019 Without having ever done it, I could show someone how to put on chains and drive uphill on two inches of ice, or give a job interview without ever having received one. From what I\u2019ve gathered I could do death, too, but I wouldn\u2019t be confident in my ability to properly show someone else.</p>\n<p>For me something is possible even if I\u2019ve only heard about it; it doesn\u2019t need to have actually happened. I\u2019ve never seen anybody die. I\u2019ve heard it from people close to me, about people close to me, but I\u2019ve been protected from it my whole life. When I\u2019d watch the news they\u2019d report that someone died in a shooting, a car crash, or a freak accident. I listened to see if it was anyone I know \u2013 it never was. I feel like everyone watches the news hoping they\u2019ll see someone they know.</p>\n<p>My senior year in high school two girls in my class made the news. One died and one didn\u2019t. The one who survived said she couldn\u2019t remember anything, probably because of trauma and partly because of choice. I didn\u2019t know them well enough. I can\u2019t imagine being the camera man for channel 5, knocking on the door to the house where all of her friends were grieving, crying; trying to remember and forget. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for your loss, but could you step into the light so we can see your face?\u201d One of my classmates was interviewed and smiled at one point. I knew he was excited to be on the news.</p>\n<p>That same week five other high schoolers died within a hundred mile radius of my school. Two years prior, three high schoolers died in a crash three miles from my house. One went to my school, but I didn\u2019t know him either. I attended the funeral of my dad\u2019s best friend, who died of a heart attack running on a trail in the woods. He was very healthy, and if someone would\u2019ve been nearby at the time, he would have survived. I only knew him through my father, but I knew more about him than how he actually\u00a0was as a person. He built his own house from scratch. His second wife took all the inheritance and split for Florida. My middle school orchestra teacher was killed in a freak boating accident. She was on a sailboat in the middle of a lake with some friends when a speed boat plowed straight through her at full throttle. The bow of the boat was raised due to its high speed so the driver assumed nothing was there. Cancer killed my physics teacher\u2019s wife and one of the preachers at church\u2019s husband. When I started college I got a call from a friend crying about how her boyfriend, a friend of mine since grade school, had cheated on her. I happened to be in a fraternity with him at the time and knew this probably wasn\u2019t true. Regardless, she grabbed as many pills as she could that night, but woke up in a mental institution so I didn\u2019t have to deal with her death. She had moved to the east coast for school, but the distance had gotten the better of her. Another close friend of mine moved to Philadelphia to be a professional cello player and stopped eating for a while, drank too much, then blacked out to the point where he couldn\u2019t remember when it all started. We were only sixteen, and I laughed along with him as he told me he almost died. Someone fell to their death at a fraternity party \u2013 someone too drunk to know what \u201cdon\u2019t\u201d means. They want you to say &#8220;fraternity&#8221; instead of &#8220;frat&#8221; to respect the brotherhood and its traditions. Someone falls or jumps off of something every year. A man burned himself alive. I walked by the grounds crew worker who drew the short straw that day and had to separate the scorched flesh and blood from the rough concrete with a brush and a mask. A girl hanged herself in the back stairwell of the fraternity I attended, but I had left a year prior. They found her limp during the recruiting\u00a0BBQ. People littered her facebook page with remorse. One post read, \u201cHey, let\u2019s catch up! Haven\u2019t heard from you in ages [smiley face].\u201d Winters get cold and dozens of hobos die in the streets. I think we\u2019re still at war with someone.</p>\n<p>I looked directly down on the puffy red snowboarder, waiting for something to happen; something exciting. Our chair passed the scene, following the example of the hundreds that had passed before us. I looked back over my shoulder, realizing the puffy man had no friends watching on. I wondered if his family was close to him, friends, or coworkers nearby, or possibly a girlfriend. \u201cLadies first.\u201d He winks at the top of the run, \u201cI\u2019ll be right behind you.\u201d Those could have been his last words as he wasn\u2019t allowed to speak in the neck brace, and his face swelled shut soon after. I figured he&#8217;ll have a crazy story to tell at some cocktail party months down the road, so I faced forward at the end of the ride and slid off with ease. The next day the paper said the puffy man had broken his neck, been paralyzed, and died that night while I was sleeping.</p>\n", "post_id": 44, "location": false, "date": "03-27-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["blurb"], "text": "<p>That moment when someone you know is having &#8220;a moment,&#8221; but it&#8217;s not really there moment to have a moment, however it takes you right out of the moment even though everyone was kind of having their own moment anyways.</p>\n", "post_id": 444, "location": false, "date": "06-29-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["6wStory"], "text": "<p>We&#8217;re talking in circles.

How does that help the voters have confidence in the candidates if all we see are mistakes? Secondly, in the land of opportunity and second chances, we sure seem to dwell on the past and use it as a measuring tool for what will happen in the future.

The gist of this whole thing I guess is a playground for my mind, however immature or intellectual it may get at times, and not some podium where I&#8217;m trying to make a difference or some sort of &#8216;statement.&#8217; It&#8217;s more for me than for you &#8212; no offense. As a writer, nothing more than &#8216;one who writes,&#8217; I find myself frequenting upon ideas and things I find interesting, or observations I find worth thinking about, but have no place to really record them, discuss them, or give them any sort of permanence so i can visit them later&#8230; so that&#8217;s what this is. This &#8220;Playgroud&#8221; will be a collection of snippets, blurbs, quotes, rants, and ramblings. Just because this is personal doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s nonfiction, and doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s fake either. Fiction is real. Someone thought of it. Who&#8217;s to say you&#8217;re asleep when you&#8217;re dreaming?</p>\n<p>This whole &#8220;blog&#8221; &#8212; I don&#8217;t like calling it that; I don&#8217;t know why &#8212; doesn&#8217;t have any context per se, and I don&#8217;t want to force any sort of context upon it so I can preserve the\u00a0genuineness\u00a0of the content; because that seems to be what matters for the most part. Maybe after a while some sort of context will emerge through the thread of themes and whatnot discussed here, but I&#8217;m not going for a narrative. I&#8217;ll just kind of write what I&#8217;m thinking of, and usually without consulting any sort of source and just write off the top of my head without revising. I might post a poem or a story every now and then, but I&#8217;m thinking just thinking might be enough for this.</p>\n<p>Back to context though: Context seems to be the one thing we as people really desire more than anything. That&#8217;s just how we work. We feel comfortable when we know how to\u00a0categorize\u00a0something, or know where it belongs. That&#8217;s what &#8216;genre&#8217; is, and why we have it. If you see a movie and try to describe it to a friend, you might do a couple things, like tell them some of the plot, but often you&#8217;ll start out with the basics and say it was a comedy/drama/action movie so your friend can have the right frame of mind to think about the movie; the right context. Even if something is far out of place (removed from it&#8217;s context) we won&#8217;t have too hard of a time with it because we know it&#8217;s original context.</p>\n<p>For example if you saw a picture of a tree sprouting forks from its branches, you&#8217;d probably be trying to make a connection with something to do with food, eating, growing, renewable, etc. because you know the two contexts of trees and forks and are trying to connect the similarities and differences of the two to parse the meaning of the picture. This is what we like to call art. In writing (&#8216;language arts&#8217;) and visual forms of art there&#8217;s typically two ways to go&#8230; You can either create a spectacle&#8211;something that makes you &#8220;ooh and ahh&#8221; at its beauty and demonstration of control and mastery of the medium, or you can draw upon context and express implicit meanings from things being either in or out of context, or providing a view of something from a context you wouldn&#8217;t normally express.</p>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t isn&#8217;t going anywhere, and it really doesn&#8217;t need to, but I&#8217;m getting bored of how many words there are. Basically: pay attention to context; when you notice it, and when you don&#8217;t. It helps.</p>\n<p>When I think of a good way to sign off, I will; but for now, a morsal:</p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;Just because it&#8217;s personal, doesn&#8217;t mean it happened.

Even though I was fearful of monsters and ghouls, in waiting for the next noise I would eventually become bored of being scared, and talk to myself or restlessly tap on the wall to pass the time, unknowingly putting monsters in my brother\u2019s closet.</p>\n<p>+===+===+===+===+===+===+===+===+===+===+===+===+===+===+===+===+<br />\n&#8230;.+= On the morrow he will leave me,+===+===+===+=== Minds are like parachutes; =+===+<br />\n+===+===+=== As my hopes have flown before. =+===+===+=best when open===+===+<br />\n&#8230;.+===+==Quoth the raven,=+===+===+===+===+===+===+===+===+===+===+===+<br />\n+=\u201cFeed me.

From Lake Stevens it takes about an hour to get to Sea-Tac, and with traffic \u2018twasabit longer, but not so bad. I didn\u2019t put my contacts in this morning so I can sleep on the flight without having my eyes revolt against the rest of my face, but we\u2019ll see how that goes. Right now I\u2019m waiting to take off, sitting in the plane. Delta Airlines did their best to slow us down at the gate, but we shall not be stopped! There was a mix up with the passports. Apparently my dad used my passport and I used my dad\u2019s. I\u2019m a bit confused because when I went to the self check-in kiosk thing with both our passports, a lady in a vest popped out of nowhere and offered to do it for me. I can\u2019t see anything so I couldn\u2019t\u2019 really check her work, and the fact that my dad had lost 30 years and I gained 30 years, so when we got to the gate they had to pull us aside to verify. \u201cSometimes we make these mistakes.\u201d The ticket checker person said that like it\u2019s no big whoop, like \u201cwe lost your bags; sometimes we make these mistakes\u2026 We canceled your flight and rerouted you to Cameron, you\u2019ll get there next week; sometimes we make these mistakes\u2026\u201d Whatever, though. It\u2019s early, and I\u2019m on the plane\u2014can\u2019t be too upset. I\u2019m just hoping I can sleep. Everytime I fly I am unfailingly near a baby. Not like \u201cOh, there\u2019s a baby on the plane somewhere in the inaudible distance,\u201d but like, I\u2019m either literally next to one or within a row of one. I always call babies \u2018it\u2019 for some reason, like they\u2019re some sort of genderless entity\u2014like a squishy amalgamation of uninhibited emotion without reason\u2026 \u201c<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">that</span> baby is cute.\u201d You might find yourself doing this\u2026 Maybe we need a male and female term for babies, like baebo for male and babie for female. There\u2019s one of those baby things two rows directly behind me, about 4 feet away, on this flight (still counts as \u2018near me\u2019). Keep the streak alive! During the safety briefing, which was an automated video, people kept beeping the call button which would trump the sound of the video and made it sound like the video lady was getting censored. Two guys in the jet way were talking about \u201cinfectious diseases\u201d and \u201cpredetermined targets\u2014\u201d and those are the only phrases I caught\u2026 it\u2019s probably nothing. It\u2019s funny without seeing (no contacts) how you view things; you can\u2019t make eye contact, just a blank stare is all I can provide, and you can\u2019t see the little things anymore; you have to get those from listening. If you stare down a long hallway you don\u2019t see depth so much as just the 2D shape of the hallway and the successive signs and markers getting smaller and smaller.</p>\n<p>Swoop. We\u2019re in the air. Plop. I am a sleep.</p>\n<p>I woke up just in time for some water. Plop. A sleep. The flight felt like 1 hour when it was actually three and a half. This is starting to become a really boring paragraph so far, and I realize I should probably at least acknowledge keeping the word count down so your expectations don\u2019t get too high before stuff actually starts happening. But I\u2019m in the Detroit Airport, and I\u2019m bored, so this is what you get right now. There\u2019s a cool fountain whit \u201cjumping\u201d water that uses a special patented nozzle to make the water squirt and look like a statue when left on. Perfect parabolas present a propensity for perplexity\u2026 excuse me\u2026 I remember seeing these things two years ago when we came back from Amsterdam after missing our direct flight. There\u2019s a train inside the terminal, but I wouldn\u2019t see it if it was heading straight for me. The terminal is really long. We walked to the end and joked about something cool being there, like a prize. I said there\u2019s probably just a really nice guy with soft hands who\u2019ll give you a handshake and say with an amiable smile, \u201cYou made it!\u201d With blurry vision all I see is a tiny light at the end of the terminal, I can\u2019t tell how long it is. Gate A55 looked like the 5\u2019s were S\u2019s (dumb laugh here). I have to follow dad wherever \u2018cause I\u2019m hopeless \u2013 Let\u2019s go here, there, turn left, right, spin around, do the hokey-polka, click your heels 3 times. Funny how things change when I can see.</p>\n<p>I find myself squinting a lot. I guess it\u2019s nice to have eyelashes so squinting is super effective. A trick that I learned in elementary school is to pinch your thumb and index finger together and then press the tips of the fingers against the pad of your index finger on your other hand so there\u2019s a tiny hole to see through between those three fingers. If you have bad vision you can look through that miniscule hole and you can see 20/20. Diffraction; google it. Maybe that\u2019s why I like physics.</p>\n<p>When the plane lifted off the runway dad turned to me with boyish excitement. \u201cIt worked!\u201d When grandpa\u2019s on the plane right as it landed he\u2019d say \u201cHa\u2014cheated death once again!\u201d I\u2019d like to think we have a tradition of one liners in this family.</p>\n<p><a title=\"Friday,\u00a027th\" href=\"http://allmostrelevant.com/2012/08/26/friday-27th/\">Next Day&gt;&gt;</a></p>\n", "post_id": 551, "location": false, "date": "08-26-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["triplog"], "text": "<p>Well, technically today is tomorrow, so I\u2019ll start a new day even though it\u2019s really still the same long slur of consciousness.

Walking through immigration and customs literally took 2 minutes. We talked to the guy about badminton and he let us into his country. There was nothing at customs; you just walk through. I\u2019m not even exaggerating. There was a line for \u201cnothing to declare\u201d and \u201cif you have stuff to declare\u201d and they both just met at the exit with absolutely zero security people in between. Hmph.</p>\n<p>We got on \u2018the Tube,\u2019 London\u2019s subway system, and after about 10 minutes and 3 stops we figured we\u2019d be there by now, but we weren\u2019t eve out of the airport yet. dang. The airport must be as big as the downtown area of Seattle. It wasn\u2019t much of a shock when the tube surfaced and we saw London daylight for the first time. Warm, humid, overcast, kind of like Seattle, but somehow I don\u2019t feel the threat of rain\u2026 but that might change. The vegetation looks much the same, and it\u2019s a pretty green city for how densely packed the building/houses are. There\u2019s lots of brick, and chimneys. Every house seemed to have a garden, or at least on the outskirts of town, and this is all while we\u2019re tired and making observations at subway speeds, so this all might be completely false information. I feel pretty awake though. Everyone on the tube is on their phone. You get tossed around a bit from side to side, but you can almost stand on one foot as long as you trust that when it bumps you to the right, that it\u2019ll return you back to the left. Momentum, man. Like good faithful Seattleites, we found a Starbucks and got some internet with a side of coffee. Or vanilla bean frap in my case. I hate coffee. I\u2019m from Seattle. Blah blah walking contradiction blah blah.</p>\n<p>The hotel has three identical paintings when you walk into the lobby. And orange backdrop with a yellow and blue smear wiping from left to right\u2014oh wait, there\u2019s another\u2014make that four. I thought I was trippin\u2019 out, and very well might have been, cause I thought there were mirrors when there weren\u2019t mirrors. We looked up trips to Stonehenge, but they were all booked.</p>\n<p>Just walking around town reminds me of a little metaphor in marketing class of how the US is a \u201cmelting pot.\u201d London is a melting pot; the US is a salad bowl\u2014there\u2019s different ingredients, but they stay clumped together.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m back in the room. It\u2019s 1 am, and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m tired anymore. Initially our room didn\u2019t have working AC, so they took a couple hours to move us to another room. We headed out and walked around Earl\u2019s Court, which is where Volleyball will be hled, and got some fish and chips with mushy peas. When we got back to the new room we thought to take a quick nap for an hour or two\u2026 woops. Jet lag came out of nowhere and slapped us silly. We went to sleep around 1:30 and woke up at 7. We hit the town for some dinner and took the tube down to Picadilly Circus, which I was rather let down to know what not an actual circus. Circus to the Britishish is like \u2018square\u2019 to us in the sense of \u201cTimes Square;\u201d however there were a few characters there. When you get on the tube, every stop an automated woman says \u201cThis is <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Glaucester Road</span>. Mind the gap between the station and the platform. This is a <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Picadilly</span> line to <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Cockfosters</span>.\u201d The underlined parts change, but it\u2019s the same every time.</p>\n<p>It started raining like it does at home. We walked around with no particular aim or purpose. There were quite a few American establishments; KFC, McDonalds, Burger King, Ben and Jerry\u2019s, M&amp;M world, Nike store, Rain Forest Caf\u00e9? Statues: there were lots of statues. It\u2019s hard to stand somewhere and not be able to see a statue. The rain chased us into an Italian restaurant (with real Italians), where we ended up watching the opening ceremonies, but skipped out once the Athletes started processing in. We watched the torch lighting in Picadilly Circus around a buncha drunk people on big TV on the side of a building. It was sponsored by Coca Cola, so every 5 minutes or so the screen would turn red with white Coke letters saying \u201cBack soon\u201d and then it went immediately back to showing the ceremonies. I thought it was going to cut out right at the climax, but thankfully it didn\u2019t. We got back around 1:30. I still don\u2019t know if I\u2019m tired. You know that feeling where you don\u2019t know if you\u2019re stuffed or starving? It\u2019s like that, but with energy. The opening ceremonies was good. It told the story of England without words. However I didn\u2019t get the whole music thing, and Voldemort, and Mr. Bean was funny, but in the Olympics? Usually these are things you put in the closing ceremonies. Hmph, oh well. I liked how the cauldron was made of all the metal things the kids carried out with each country during the procession, and then they all came together like a flower or something. Pretty sweet.</p>\n<p><a title=\"Saturday,\u00a028th\" href=\"http://allmostrelevant.com/2012/08/26/saturday-28th/\">Next Day&gt;&gt;</a></p>\n", "post_id": 556, "location": false, "date": "08-26-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["triplog"], "text": "<p>We got up at 6:30 and just got some McDonalds like good americans, and also nothing else was open. They have bagel McMuffins here. So delicious, but going straight to my hips. I\u2019m destroying my dainty figure. The Tube was pretty much empty because it was Saturday, but everything was closed early anyway. We wondered what people here do all day. They start late and end early; how do they make their money? I guess a few European countries are going bankrupt. We tubed to Wembley stadium and arena, which is a huge looking building. The arena is where the badminton is, so that\u2019s where we went\u2026 yup. It\u2019s just me and dad, but we had 4 tickets so he tried to sell the other two, and did. We later learned it\u2019s not okay to scalp tickets, but whatevs, it\u2019s the first day. While doing that, two Estonians asked if we had tickets for the evening session so they could watch their son play, Raul Must. We exchanged numbers and would call them if we ended up having extra tickets. The venue inside was incredible, and outside you had to go through security and walk passed the smilikng men with assault rifles. I guess that makes me feel safe. If something happens, the men with assault rifles will make sure whatever happens gets turned into swiss cheese. I saw some unarmed guys moseying about in the middle of the day with jackets that said \u201cSECURITY,\u201d but in comparison I felt the guys with automatic rifles could do more than the guys without in terms of \u201cSECURITY.\u201d Back to the venue; it was lovely to watch in, and very well lit. There was a whole Japanese cheering section that cheered loud for the women, but no for the men. They sounded like a group of 5-8 year-olds, but when I turned around none of them were younger than me. It\u2019s like they took a person and compressed them, voice and all. Little tiny voices.</p>\n<p>Lunch. Walked around. Came back. Gym hot and sweaty. Building no A/C b/c make wind. Many bodies make hot. Rarg. Our first seats were in the mid-level with our backs against a small wall. Our second seats were all the way on the side, and all the way in the back row on the top, with our backs against the wall. Our third seats were on the floor between courts 1 and 3 with our back against the wall. The courts were numbered 2 1 3. Don\u2019t ask why. In the last session we got to see Howard and Tony play the Koreans. They lost, but got 19 in the second. I thought they were going to pull it out. Rob and his wife Rachel, long time family friends, landed that afternoon and were able to join us for the last session so we didn\u2019t give our tickets to the Estonian guy\u2019s parents, but they ended up finding some so it all worked out anyways. We sat just behind the parents of the Belgian singles playres. They have two children in the Olympics; pretty sweet. Team singapore showed up for one game and left. They were loud. We were exhausted after 10+ hours of badminton going off a 5 hour night\u2019s sleep that we went home and crashed, and screwed up all my grammers. I thought of some jokes today, like funny things and stuff, but have no capacity for memory or humor right now \u2018cause I\u2019m so wiped; just capacity for sleep.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a title=\"Sunday,\u00a029th\" href=\"http://allmostrelevant.com/2012/08/26/sunday-29th/\">Next Day&gt;&gt;</a></p>\n", "post_id": 558, "location": false, "date": "08-26-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["triplog"], "text": "<p>Meet a 10:30, woke up at 9:45. Sleep with curtains open. Got a tourist London pass thing. Saw London Bridge, but it didn\u2019t fall down. Rain. Crap. Bought umbrellas though completely sunny in the morning, but awful rain. Not like seattle. Seattle rains all day; here rains for 30 minutes and stops. Kept umbrellas in my backpack cup holders so my butt ended up getting really wet <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-sad' title=':('>:(</span> so much stuff going on in London. You forget that the population of the city is more than the population of Washington state, but when you see the building, the tube, a train cross the river, and a battleship docked outside, you\u2019re quickly reminded. We walked across one of the bridges where we had a clear view of Londond bridge. We took a picture and someone said \u201cGo Huskies!\u201d Awesome. It was a family on vacation from California. The rain chased us to a pub where we got those meat pies for lunch, like in Sweeney Tod, but different ingredients like chicken and stuff\u2026 I think.</p>\n<p>In the tube stations on the escalators theres 11\u00bd by 17 posters as ads. Sometimes they\u2019re random, but on one of the escalators Nike has a whole row, and the theater\u2014excuse me\u2014the theat<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">re</span> district has a whole row. Apparently Shrek and Matilda are musicals now. Walking around it\u2019s funny because you can spot the Americans real easy, and there\u2019s actually quite a lot here for the Olympics. They\u2019re the ones who talk simple and have no fashion sinse. I\u2019m no exception, except I\u2019ve been getting better at my British accents.</p>\n<p>With our umbrellas held high and proud, our next stop was Londond Tower. I was expecting a tower, but found an old city/fort sort of thing; you know, where they used to build a big wall and then people lived inside it. We learned all sorts of things. The British took canons back as trophies from the places they conquered. A few of the kings back in the day were only boys, so they had little baby armor *ahem* <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">armour</span> made for them. Quays is pronounced \u201ckeys.\u201d (I know English has some silly spellings; but that\u2019s just ridiculous). Whenever I see a messed up spelling I always wonder what Colonel Bologna would have to say about it. But anywayses; the crown jewels are shiny. Wow. So much sparkle. If you touch your pinky finger and thumb together, you see how your thumb muscle kind of squishes together into a big lump? Yeah, that\u2019s how big the diamond was. We couldn\u2019t take pictures, which sucked. I thought about sneaking a picture in, but I\u2019m sure the guards would love to quickly usher me back outside. Those guards had huge shoes, like border line clown shoes, but it\u2019s intimidating when they are completely serious while wearing them. Clearly humor is not the place for this mood, but we found ourselves making wise cracks about the queen and stuff about every minute. I think we\u2019re just jealous of her job on a base level. They had one of the crowns of when the crown jewels were sacked in 1669(ish). It looked like an empty bee hive because all the jewels had been plucked off it and stolen, and all that remained were the holes. Outside we saw one of the guards with the fuzzy black hats and red coats. He didn\u2019t move much. He was just my age though. Made you think it was the crappist job in the army to stand there and just shift your eyes around all day while people take pictures of you. I figured he\u2019d be a good guy to test out a new standup comedy routine on. Just start your jokes, and if you can make this guy crack, then you know it\u2019s good material. One more quick thing about the crown jewels; they also had a baquet set that was made entirely of gold. To give you an idea of the scale, you could take a bath in the punch bowl (the ladle was a conch shell on a 3 foot handle), and the cup/pitchers were about a gallon or two. It was definitiely dining ware fit for a king (or queen). When we came to London Tower it was pissing down rain, but when we left it was sunny and blue sky again, just like the morning. I don\u2019t understand this place.</p>\n<p>We headed out to a part of town that was supposed to be nicer; and it was. Extravagance at its best/worse/I had know idea what \u2018wealthy\u2019 meant. There\u2019s this store call Harrods that only sell the most expensive things you can buy. An emerald necklace over 250K, watches up to 90K, and this is all in pounds, not dollars, and such things as liters of perfume, 100 inch TV\u2019s, and personal submersive scooters. And once you buy all these expensive things and are a shining beacon of luxury and get paranoid that people will want to mug you, you can purchase a bullet proof suit or tux, All the sales people there are my age, dolled up in pretty dresses and suits, and really good at sales. All we bought was a 4 pound thing of salmon at the food place. 4 pounds as in like somewhere around $6. I hate using pounds as currency \u2018cause it\u2019s so damn confusing. When I was counting my change I wanted to say \u201cthree pounds eleven ounces.\u201d Outside was a Mclaren showroom and a Lambourghini showroom. I don\u2019t really understand expensive fast cars. If you buy one you end up driving slow so everyone can see it\u2019s you behind the wheel, but if you had a crappy car you\u2019d drive fast to save face; at least you would in this neiborhood. \u201cYou only have an \u201909 Benz? Stop wasting my air.\u201d I suppose luxury is not for me. We ate fish n\u2019 chips at a pub again and wound down for the night.</p>\n<p><a title=\"Monday,\u00a030th\" href=\"http://allmostrelevant.com/2012/08/26/monday-30th/\">Next Day&gt;&gt;</a></p>\n", "post_id": 560, "location": false, "date": "08-26-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["triplog"], "text": "<p>On almost every intersection, on the pavement is painted \u201c\u00dfLOOK LEFT\u201d or \u201cLOOK RIGHT \u00e0\u201d because dad has unknowingly stepped into traffic like so many other Americans. It feels weird having to look the \u2018wrong way,\u2019 but you just have to pretend that being a bad pedestrian is the right thing to do, and then you won\u2019t get run over. I still think it\u2019s kind of funny to have advice written on the street. I think they should say other things too. LOOK RIGHT. TIE YOUR SHOES. FLOSS DAILY. CALL GRANDMA. It\u2019d be good for the whole city. We tried to see Wimbledon today, but only got to see the outside of the stadium because there were no tickets available. We had lunch in the town of Wimbledon and surprisingly the tennis wasn\u2019t on TV. Only equestrian. We tubed over to the town of Richmond, which had a big grassy park and a place to play cricket, but we basically walked around and went back to London. It was a nice area, but that was about it. It\u2019s kind of funny how dense the population is here, and how there\u2019s no zoning like we\u2019re used to. You\u2019ll be in a residential neighborhood, and then turn the corner and there\u2019s a huge electronic billboard on the back of an apartment complex.</p>\n<p>We went up a monument in memoriam of the great fire of London in 1666 (also a year, like this one, in which people thought the world was ending) that started in a pudding shop. It was 311 steps up or something like that, I wasn\u2019t counting, and had a great view of London. There\u2019s not too many tall buildings, not like a US city, but there\u2019s a few cranes up, and they\u2019re building vertical. We were just killing time because we were going to meet up with Huaiwen at 5. We went to get Chinese food and she laughed at us, coming all this way and eating Chinese food, but honestly I\u2019ve had fish and chips about every other meal. I still don\u2019t get why they call fries \u201cchips.\u201d What are chips then? \u2018crisps\u2019 or something? We kind of caught up and she\u2019s doingw ell. She resigned from the Dutch team and is planning to move again, but is not set particularly on where. She gave her all-access pass to her one athelete\u2019s husband so they could enjoy the Olympics together, which was really kind, but now she\u2019s kind of just shuffling around the city be herself. She asked how we were enjoying London, and I hadn\u2019t taken a step back to think about it, so I said I kind of feel like a gopher. You get in the tube and go underground and pop your head out and see something, and then go underground and pop out again; you never really get a feel for where things are. She seems really happy though.</p>\n<p>We parted and went to go see the Buckingham Place where the beach volleyball was being played, but you can\u2019t even get near the awesome venue without a ticket. We almost saw a lot of cool venues today; however we did stroll through Trafalgar Square (which is only called \u2018square\u2019 because it\u2019s actually a square), Big Ben, parliament, and the outside of Westminster abbey, which we thought was St. Paul\u2019s cathedral at the time, and the beach volleyball is actually at Hyde Park. Obviously we know what we\u2019re doing in this city. We saw the London \u2018I\u2019 too, but I really think it looks more like an \u2018O.\u2019 They had a \u201clights show\u201d on the ferris wheel while the sun was setting over the Thames, but it wasn\u2019t much of anything, seriously. It just blinked a little. I suppose the fact that there was no crowd should have been a clue. The police lights zooming through the streets towards the other end of town were more impressive. Btw there are statues and monuments everywhere in this city, new and old.</p>\n<p>I feel like I\u2019ve seen everything, but seen hardly anything. There\u2019s so much to see. At least I\u2019m adjusted for the time zone now.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a title=\"Tuesday,\u00a031st\" href=\"http://allmostrelevant.com/2012/08/26/tuesday-31st/\">Next Day&gt;&gt;</a></p>\n", "post_id": 562, "location": false, "date": "08-26-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["triplog"], "text": "<p>I woke up at 10:30 even thought I went to bed at mindnight. I don\u2019t know if that means I\u2019m getting better or worse at sleep. We went and saw Westminster Abbey. Dad and Susan were both tired and running completely on flickers of adrenaline, which was fun to watch, but I could see their crash was imminent. The train was reaching the end of the tracks, but not slowing down. The Abbey was massive and brilliant. This was another place where you weren\u2019t allowed to take pictures, but I saw the sign just after I snapped a quick one; or at least that\u2019s my story. You get a little audio guide and map to help you appreciate everything, from the hundreds of years of heritage buried on site, the stone work, the stories, and the fact that it\u2019s still a church; there was a service going on while we were in there. The ceiling in one of the wings is so intricate it was declared a wonder of the world as soon as it was finished. Every king and queen of England that ever lived is buried there. There are giant granite slabs on the floor to mark where they are buried underneath, but so many feet have traversed the ancient stone that some of the engravings have been worn smooth and nameless over time. One of the tombs is of some royal baby who died as a baby, so they made a baby statue in his honor. His mother is buried adjacent, staring longingly at the son she barely had for all eternity. A bunch of famous writers, scientists, and composers are buried here as well. \u201cI guess if you\u2019re and English writer, this is the goal.\u201d I said, looking down at the dozens of dead poets. \u201cYeah,\u201d said dad \u201cThat\u2019s the goal.\u201d I glanced around. \u201cKinda grim though.\u201d A few of the names I can recall as of this instant are Chaucer, Shakespeare, Dickens, Handel, Elgar, Vaughn Williams, Darwin, Newton, and a bunch of other 18<sup>th</sup>-19<sup>th</sup> century writers.</p>\n<p>After the Abbey we tried to find a place to rest our feet and watch the Olympics. We ventured into a fish n chips house, but they only had my dearly behated \u201cdressage\u201d on, which is equestrian, which is horses, which is stupid in my opinion. Horses are not an Olympic sport. I\u2019m sorry if you\u2019re a horse, but you don\u2019t belong in a human competition. I understand having to take your racket bag with you to the Olympics, but having to charter your horse around with you? Ooph. Save us all the trouble. I must be feeling a bit snide today. I\u2019m quite hungry. In the morning for breakfast the same thing was on as well. Horses all day every day. However a kind lady asked if we wanted to watch American sport, and I said \u201cAnything, really.\u201d And she told us where a sports pub was, and when we walked in there was badminton on six TV\u2019s. We got to see Kevin Cordon beat the home town Rajiv Ouseph 21-19 in the third. Probably the most intense game of the tournament so far. Huaiwen texted dad around 4 because she had an extra ticket for tonight\u2019s matches. Long story short, everyone else was kinda pooped, so I headed over to the weightlifting place where Huaiwen was. We got to catch up more on a long tube ride. We talked about moving and starti new lives and such. It was fun. When we got off she went through the special people entrance to the arena and I walked around to the plebian entrance. The seat was in the back corner all the way back against the wall. Not great seats, but there were some great matches. China vs. Taiwan in doubles and mixed, Zweibler and Ukraine, but probably the weirdest thing was the fans booing the woman\u2019s doubles games because both sides of the net were intentionally trying to lose. I walked in late so I didn\u2019t really catch on too quick. They should\u2019ve had the two strongest pairs play each other 1<sup>st</sup> or2nd, and then this problem goes away. I didn\u2019t even know why everyone was boing until I saw it on the news where players were trying to lose to avoid playing china first round. I have the room to myself now. I have that new song by Neontrees stuck in my head. I went to sleep.</p>\n<p><a title=\"Wednesday, August\u00a01st\" href=\"http://allmostrelevant.com/2012/08/26/wednesday-august-1st/\">Next Day&gt;&gt;</a></p>\n", "post_id": 564, "location": false, "date": "08-26-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["triplog"], "text": "<p>It is August. I started my day with a couple McDonalds bagels and a chocolate frap at starbucks. I\u2019m so healthy it\u2019s <em>sick</em> (isn\u2019t that the slang these days?). I met up with the crew inside Wembley Arena for badminton at 12:30. We got to see a really good mixed game where the Polish team fought off two match points from china\u2019s second team, get a match point of their own, but then lose. Wop wop wop. They went from being up 16-12 to being down 16-18. Both teams were really nervous, but it\u2019s amazing what you can do when you see the cliff and someone starts to push you. We got to see Lee Chong Wei play too, and he was on fire. He was playing Simon Santoso, and after the first 11 Santoso looked like he was out of ideas, and not soon after he was out of the tournament.</p>\n<p>We walked along the sort of \u2018boardwalk\u2019 area of London along the river and took the Eye (the ferries wheel). Wow; what a view. London isn\u2019t really a tall city, and it\u2019s very flat, so you could see for miles and miles. It was extrodinry. You could see the Palace from there, but the most interesting building for me was the HM Treasury Building, which is big, stone and square on the outside, but has a giant circular cut-out on the inside. Hmm, something\u2019s odd at the \u201cHM\u201d building, hmm?? Big Ben looks awesome across the water. We tried to take pictures where the postcards take pictures. When the eye completes a revolution (about 20-30 minutes. it looked like 1 fps linear velocity give or take) and drops you back off, it lets go a bucketful of water, or the equivalent of, back into the river. When you first step in you notice the AC is blasted and it\u2019s quite chilly. This is probably so the claustrophobic people who got pressured into getting shoved in a glass capsule and hung 400 feet over the horizon don\u2019t pass out. When you go through a very relaxed version of security, they ask you if you have any sharp objects, but don\u2019t ask if you have a fear of small enclosed spaces hoisted hundreds of feet over water. We took the tube to the \u201cedgy\u201d part of town, as described by a local. It wasn\u2019t any more or less nice, really, but there were a lot more black people here than before, and now I\u2019m just thinking that person was racist. I was told the London Riots started in this part of town. We found a niche little bar that apparently was written about in the New York Times. Being hip I think is all about making being pooor look like a cool thing to do. The bar was a bookshelf with books in it, the tables were old desks, and the silverware container was a can for peppers or something; and none of this stuff was new, they were all old tables and bookshelves and cans of stuff. We wanted food but it was 7:30 and the kitchen was closed. In fact the bar and the entire block shut down at 8. I don\u2019t know how they can make any money with those hours. In America you\u2019d go out of business closing a bar at 8. On the tube I noticed British people all sort of have the same kind of nose that is kind of round on the end, like a ball, but this old old guy doing Sudoku had hair on his nose; like, like actual grey whiskers\u2014more like bristles. It was so weird. I guess when you get old your hair gets bored and stops growing on your head, and instead finds other places to sprout. I had a drink at the bar and was testing my balance to compare how I felt vs. how I act after one drink. My balance is fine, but I needed to make sure I wasn\u2019t seeing things either. My eyes are slower. We got dinner and shared 3 pitchers of some sort of fruity wine drink. I felt slow; like visually slow, but felt no change in mood or balance after 3 drinks. Whatever. I still don\u2019t get the whole alcohol thing. Water\u2019s better.</p>\n<p>(discussed how people back home probably went to Europe and saw how many monuments there were and said we needed more art, and now it\u2019s a law that you need art in public spaces or something.) (stupid)</p>\n<p>On the tube someone said to me, \u201cSeattle?\u201d \u201cyes, where are you from?\u201d \u201cSame.\u201d \u201cNice.\u201d I was wearing my UW shirt again. I asked him what he was here to see, and when I mentioned badminton he seemed uninterested. I figured he wasn\u2019t looking for a conversation, but too bad buddy; it\u2019s time to educate the public! I shared my thoughts on the 8 women\u2019s doubles players being disqualified from the Olympics for trying to finish 2<sup>nd</sup> in their round robins, and some other passengers were intrigued, but I had to get off, and at the end of the day, badminton is just a silly sport.</p>\n<p><a title=\"Thursday,\u00a02nd\" href=\"http://allmostrelevant.com/2012/08/26/thursday-2nd/\">Next Day&gt;&gt;</a></p>\n", "post_id": 566, "location": false, "date": "08-26-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["triplog"], "text": "<p>I turned off the alarm when I should\u2019ve pressed snooze. That\u2019s the one disadvantage with turning up the A/C and having warm blankets; you want to sleep and be warn, but you don\u2019t want to step into the cold. I was having some dream where I was laughing, but then I snapped out of it, jumped out of bed, and ran to the nearest tube station. I barely got to the badminton by nine-ish, and the first matches had just started. At least I got a good little half mile jaunt in running from the train to the venue. I haven\u2019t exercised all trip, and now I\u2019m wondering how you would exercise around here because I have no idea how you fit a gym in this city. All the men\u2019s doubles were on. First it was China v. China, which was good because China lost, and then Malaysia beat Thailand. Long story short, the doubles was absolutely amazing, even thought it was just four matches and then the session was over. They must be making a fortune on ticket sales. We estimated they\u2019re making about $13 million in ticket sales on badminton alone. I\u2019d like to know the real number is. We walked down Picadilly street for the first time, which has little alley way off shorts from the street which have red carpets and 4 kinds of shops; jewelry, bags, shoes, and watches. I don\u2019t know how those places stay in business, because for one; there was no one there buying, and two; there were literally 10-15 of each type of store side by side. We wondered what the one security guard would do if we all started running down the alley after saying \u201cI got the goods.\u201d British popo are unarmed. We stopped for lunch/breakfast and a French looking place with awesome looking pastries in the window. The others ordered Eggs Benedict, and I ordered a ham and cheese omelet because I have yet had breakfast/we all hadn\u2019t. The French native waitress brought out three eggs benedict, and I was confused and checked with her that I ordered a ham and cheese omelet. I said, \u201cIordered a ham and cheese omelet,\u201d and she smiled and nodded, saying \u201cyes, okay. I will change this,\u201d or something like that, and took my plate back. I\u2019ve noticed a pattern with the people here in that they are very stubborn; and it\u2019s not so good. No one will ever say \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d The British are a proud people, and that does not help them. The first instance we got was in asking directions for places about a week ago. Most people give good friendly adcive, but when they don\u2019t know, they still smile and point and give it their best shot, which has sent us in the wrong direction a few times because they acted like they know what they were talking about. You have to ask direct questions to make sure you aren\u2019t being pleasantly dismissed. The best run-in was when dad asked a guy, \u201cDo you know what street this is?\u201d \u201cYes, sir.\u201d (pause) \u201cgreat\u2026 could you tell me what street this is?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know what street this is.\u201d He replied with a smile. It was a city worker, too, where his job is to help guide and direct traffic. You think he\u2019d at least know by now. So then the French waitress brought me back my new grilled cheese sand\u2014\u201cExcuse me, um, I didn\u2019t order a grilled cheese sandwich. (it was one thin slice of cheese between bread) I had a ham and cheese omelet; ham and cheese omelet\u2026 with eggs.\u201d She looked confused, like she had not nodded and smiled before and said \u201cI will have that ready for you\u201d \u2026twice. Another guy swooped in to change out the plate and rescue the situation. I felt bad. I\u2019m pretty sure I didn\u2019t slur my speech or anything, but I just don\u2019t think she was listening that hard. Anyways, it was a good omelet, and ended up being free (score!).</p>\n<p>We checked out a museum which displayed some USA guy\u2019s collection of 18<sup>th</sup>-19<sup>th</sup> century French Impressionist art, but didn\u2019t get tickets to see the full exhibit; just the free parts. On the way out I\u2019d finish a drink, and for about the tenth time this trip I\u2019d had lots of trash cans around, finished the drink, and then had no trash cans around; quite frustrating. The British take a very preventative approach to keeping trash/garbage/litter/rubbish down in the city\u2014there are no garbage cans. I mean, there\u2019s a few, but way less than you\u2019d want. It\u2019s like people have learned that there are no garbage cans around, so they don\u2019t take any waste with them onto the streets because they won\u2019t be able to throw it away.</p>\n<p>Buckingham Place.

Our fearless leader of the USAB was nice enough to give us day passes. We had plans for the day to go out and see some stuff, but ended up literally staying there the entire day. I got there first at 10:40 or so and walked in. There were TV\u2019s everywhere upstairs and downstairs with everything on, couches, American outlet to charge your American stuff (insert grunt of happiness), gourmet desserts and food, an endless bar, and a deck with an upper level\u2014and everything was unlimited, and free. Just one little desert thing would cost about $5 at some fancy pants restaurant, and I probably ate about a $100 worth of desserts. I think I had about 7 little cr\u00e8me brule mini dish things. At about 11:30 the others showed up and were amazed as I was. I told them \u201cthis si definitely a place we want to come back to.\u201d Which was the purpose of this \u2018introductory\u2019 visit. We ended up staying there until 11pm. I went souvenir shopping and grabbed a few shirts to look at them, and then folded them back and stood there thinking what I should get, but the price tags said \u201cdon\u2019t bother.\u201d The coolest jacked there was $450, and a t-shirt was $60. Like, just a normal t-shirt. People started asking me \u201cdo you have this in medium?\u201d and \u201cwhere\u2019s the men\u2019s and women\u2019s section?\u201d I haven\u2019t shaved in two days and am wearing pants and a blue shirt, which apparently makes me look like I know what the hell I\u2019m doing. Even on the walk over some guy asked me where Barclays is, and I said \u201cit\u2019s on this road, just two more blocks and on the right.\u201d I would\u2019ve been more British of me to not actually know where it was, but give him directions nonetheless, but somehow I did actually know what I was talking about\u2026 weird. I though about actually pretending to work for the souvey shop for a bit, but quickly abandoned the idea and ate some more dessert. I think there\u2019s about a 3-5 year difference with/out facial hairage. I guess it\u2019s just part of my \u201cHair-itage.\u201d It\u2019s a pun, get it? Am I funny yet? No? fine, then we\u2019ll just keep slogging through this overly wordy and droll account of nothingness in the midst of something-ness. Atheletes started to trickle in, and once you get to talking with those around you, you quickly realize that about 90% of the people in the room are Olympians; it\u2019s like a family business. \u201cI was on the \u201992 Team.\u201d \u201cI was \u201988. Do you have any kids competing?\u201d \u201cNot in this one. My daughter\u2019s a skier.\u201d \u201cOh, really? Skiing? My daughter\u2019s a rower. Well you\u2019ll have fun in Sochi in two years.\u201d \u201cYeah, I wish water skiing was an Olympic sport, then she could do that here, too.\u201d \u201cYeah, it\u2019s probably for the best they don\u2019t allow mechanized sports.\u201d I learned something. They played American music from iconic American artists like Johnny Cash, JayZ, and Beyonce, and various pop rubbish you hear over the waves. The walls were lined with pictures of USA athletes; rhythmic gymnastics, archery, pingpong, taekwondo and other smaller sports.</p>\n<p>Later it turned into a big party. Some rowers walked in. Holy shit. Huge people. Rowers are huge amazon women with gigantic back muscles. Before we knew who those people from our country were with gold medals around their necks, we tried to guess their sport by the body type and build. There\u2019s so much skill and whatnot involved in all the sports, but it ultimately comes down to who\u2019s bigger in a lot of sports. Susan grabbed one to take a picture and told me and dad to hop in. I feel so small next to this giant woman, however I\u2019m very motivated to train hard after seeing all of these medalists. It got crowded later where someone would sidestep by you and there medal would bump against your shoulder. This is a crazy awesome atmosphere. They had little presentations for/by the coaches from/to the athletes. Rowing first, then later the silver medal archery team. We met a shooter. It was cool to hear him talk about how he has to work to pay for practice and life in general, well, not really cool per se, but It was fun to talk with a fellow minor sport, even though shooting is about 5 times more popular in the US than badminton in terms of competition. He\u2019s a bartender in Colorado Springs. In my mind I pictured some guy breaking in and trying to rob the place, and this guy shoots the gun out of his hand. I saw the little gymnast who got silver or bronze at Beijing; the one they always pointed the camera at. She\u2019s super small. Our fearless leader was able to get us passes for tomorrow, too, at the expense of one of our badminton tickets.</p>\n<p>Out fearless leader of the USAB showed up with his friend, Mike, who explained how our fearless leader had the easiest life ever. Worked for the military at the airforce base. Wanted to get an advanced degree so he didn\u2019t have to go to war. The love advanced degrees, but it was in recreation. They still let him do it. After that his job was aide to the head of something, on US soil, escorting the top official\u2019s 18 year old daughter to football games and getting paid with his 6 year pay salary that he had only worked 2 years for. Apparently he was on the record as having served for four extra years, so he got a bump in pay. From there he got a job as head of westpoint recreation department and got medals and shit like the guys who kill people, or maybe gave them out, I couldn\u2019t quite hear. It\u2019s loud. From there something bad happened, and as it was described, \u201che fell flat on his ass into a bed of roses called chief executive officer of usa badminton.\u201d Mike Rolled his eyes and laughed. They\u2019ve known each other all their lives.</p>\n<p>I went to sleep in the night time. I know, right? Thrilling narrative.</p>\n<p><a title=\"Saturday,\u00a04th\" href=\"http://allmostrelevant.com/2012/08/26/saturday-4th/\">Next Day&gt;&gt;</a></p>\n", "post_id": 570, "location": false, "date": "08-26-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["triplog"], "text": "<p>Today\u2019s the women\u2019s finals. It ended up being China\u2019s #2 against Japan\u2019s #1 team. Japan had a couple game points in the second game, but China\u2019s just too good. The #3 Chinese woman beat Wang Yihan in 3 good games. It was a brutal match, but Yihan works a lot harder in her footwork, and doesn\u2019t have as strong of a counter attack as the other girl had. Saina played for the bronze, and got it, but only because Wang Xin injured herself pretty badly. Despite being injured she still put the game away in one shot, but after the first rally of the next game she crumpled in a heap of defeat and couldn\u2019t walk. The gym was full of Chinese, but everyone else, including a lot of Indians, were cheering for Saina. I wanted China to lose, but I hate to see it in that fashion; that just sucks. The podiums are getting more diverse now though, and it\u2019s cool. The countires who\u2019ve medeled are China, India, Denmark, Japan, and Russia, with Malaysia and possibly Korea with a chance to finish on the podium as well. Speaking of podiums; for the ceremony they lowered the podium from the ceiling, but not in a \u2018razzle-dazzle\u2019 sort of way. They just thought the ceiling is where it\u2019d be most out of the way, but apparently overlooked that it takes 5 minutes to lower the thing down using their impossibly slow motor. For some reason after the first medal ceremony they hoisted the podium back up to the ceiling, and then had to bring it back down later; it\u2019s not like it was in the way or anything. So because the podium takes forever to descend to the ground, we figured we\u2019d skip out on hearing the Chinese national anthem again and left, only to get caught up in a crowd of 50,000 plus leaving Wembley Stadium. There were cops on horses just standing at certain places in a line. The horses really funneled the people down and slowed things up, and apparently they\u2019re good for crowd control, but they shat all over the pavement. We eventually made it back to the USA house again where we got to eat awesome food and rub elbows with the athletes. There was a guy there with the last name Fosbury. Google it. The Brits had a good day for medals and won about 4 or 5 golds or something like that. I think the US did too. All the athletes and even the non-athletes look like models. Not much really happened though besides just eating awesome food and being absorbed in the whole Olympic experience\u2026 nbd. There was a band. The USA house was definitely one of the highlights of the trip. If you ever, ever go to the Olympics, you need to find a way into the USA house, or ever any other country\u2019s house. It\u2019s amazing.</p>\n<p>Going back to the room I felt rather parched, and upon experiencing such a feeling of parchment, I stopped at ye olde Burger King for a cup of water cause it was the only thing open at that hour.</p>\n<p><a title=\"Sunday,\u00a05th\" href=\"http://allmostrelevant.com/2012/08/26/sunday-5th/\">Next Day&gt;&gt;</a></p>\n", "post_id": 572, "location": false, "date": "08-26-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["triplog"], "text": "<p>Finally, the singles final. The moment we\u2019ve all been waiting for, but first I had to get my extra ticket to Chris, who was meeting me outside the ticket office at noon. We got going late and got to the arena at 12:45. I was trying to text but there\u2019s no service in da chube, so I was kinda freakin\u2019 out when I got there and he was nowhere in sight. AFterall I was 45 minutes late and he probably gave up. I waited there, and mistakenly had let my dad take the phone inside the venue with him. There\u2019s a strict, \u201cNo one can re-enter the venue policy, so it kind of turned into a game at that point; If I go in Chris can\u2019t see the matches, but if I stay out I don\u2019t see them either. The match starts in 10 minutes and Chris could be either inside or outside. I figured I\u2019d wait \u2018til 12:15 and then go in if he wasn\u2019t there; I just wouldn\u2019t be able to give him the ticket. While I waited I thought about the weather because I opened and closed my umbrella 4 times in that span of time. I thought about the crazy lady this morning with a cockney accent and pajamas, yelling at the bobbies who were holding an assorted bag of medicine up to another sketchy character, \u201cIdiots! oll\u2014idiots! I foind it \u2018ilarious!\u201d I thought about how I got a raging sore throat overnight, and a runny nose, and wondered how I\u2019m supposed to blow my nose when there\u2019s no garbage cans anywhere. Why did people have to bomb the tube? I thought about how yesterday during the great sports exodus once on the tube a girl and her boyfriend got on after me, and there wan\u2019t much room, so I had to grab the rail behind the guy\u2019s head so we were face to face with his girlfriend uncomfortably squished between us. Probably the most awkward situation I\u2019ve been in, especially because they were both facing me. It was either that or fall down when the train started moving. I thought about how I wanted some water and burger kind was the closest thing last night, and some guy asked me for the time. I didn\u2019t have a phone, watch, anything. \u201cwhat do you mean you don\u2019t have the time?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t have it.\u201d \u201cYou must have the fucking time.\u201d \u201cWell you don\u2019t have it either, so\u2026 take it easy.\u201d I think he thought I thought he was sketchy, so I wasn\u2019t going to \u2018give\u2019 him anything, so he got all pissy. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you don\u2019t have the\u2014there. (he looks at the clock) ten \u2018til twelve; geez.\u201d I thought about how this city is one of the oldest in the world, ie: most experienced, but it still has its drawbacks. I thought about how I learned that the moats around castles were a big toilet, and that\u2019s why they were so effective. The whole town would just drop trou and shit in the moat, and no one wants to swim through poop water no matter how badly they want your town. I thought of how I was ready to go home even though I\u2019ve had a lot of fun. I thought of a lot of things to distract me from the fact that I was missing this singles match. I asked a man with a watch, \u201cDo you have the time?\u201d \u201cquarter past.\u201d I could see it was 12:18. I waited 2 minutes and went it. The score was 17-12 lee Chong Wei was up. There were a lot of Malaysian flags waving, and they weren\u2019t just waving for Lee Chong Wei, they were waving for the world. Mike Evans, the man we met at USA House, said we should start cheering ABC! ABC! \u201cAnyone But China!\u201d It was a valid point. It\u2019s always China against the world, and China\u2019s winning 3-0 right now, but they\u2019ll win the doubles easy, so this match is our only chance\u2014\u201cours\u201d as in \u201cthe word\u2019s.\u201d If you haven\u2019t watched this match, a rematch of the Beijing finals, you need to watch it from start to finish. It\u2019s probably one of the best men\u2019s singles matches ever played. They were throwing their entire existence into every point, and when Lin Dan won the final point he ran off the court in pure excitement and joy toward where we were sitting, and fell down in tears of joy with his coaches close behind. You always see those guys win and stay so composed, like it\u2019s just their job, but this was the happiest I\u2019ve ever seen anyone after a sports match of any sort, and it was awesome; but as happy as Lin Dan was, was how devastated Lee Chong Wei was. All he could do was sit on the floor and do his best to hold himself together. He just sat there and breathed, staring blankly out at the last four years, at second place, at nothing. His coaches stood over him, not picking him up, not consoling him\u2014what could they say? That was the image of defeat, and it was sad. Just before this my phone was ringing during match point. Chris was almost here. There was no one working at the ticket office to make leaving the ticket possible for pick-up, so I went towards the exit and found a lady who said she could hand him the ticket if he came \u2018round the back, but if I stepped past the threshold of the door I couldn\u2019t be let in, because somehow stepping foot outside makes me a dangerous man. She wasn\u2019t kidding either. A man in front of me made that mistake and took a step outside, turned around, and wasn\u2019t let back in. It\u2019s a bit over the top, but whatever. I was able to make the transfer and we got back to out seats right as the medal ceremony started. Lee Chong Wei was crying as the Chinese flag was raised and the anthem played. Watching badminton, you get to know the Chinese anthem pretty well. There were tow American guys, older, about 60 or so, sitting to the right of us. The one guy apparently runs Koch Industries, which manufactures parts and equipment and instruments for chemical engineering stuff or something. Apparently this guy\u2019s like a rock star in the chem E world, so dad just had to turn to me and whisper \u201cThis guy runs Coke Industries.\u201d Unfortunately \u201cKoch\u201d sounds just like \u201cCoke,\u201d so I thought he ran CocaCola and wanted to make some crack about Pepse stepping on their coat tails. Thankfully I didn\u2019t. Apparently if you donate $300,000 or more to the USOC they\u2019ll give you a pass to all the events. He flew his own jet to London. The doubles wasn\u2019t much. Cai and Fu dominated like they have been for the last 4 years. The crowd wasn\u2019t even rooting for the Danes that hard. We left right after the last point. China got 5 gold medals in badminton. Ugh. It was expected, but still disappointing.</p>\n<p>We saw the Churchill War Memorial after. Churchill was an interesting guy. All the helpers that were still alive describe in this one video that working for him was similar to working for Dr. House. Well, they didn\u2019t make that comparison\u2014I did\u2014but that\u2019s what they were describing. Churchill had his own gimmicks for sloughing off incompetency, and there was a whole museum devoted to showing how witty and smart and awesome he was. He ran the whole war from underground. There was a 6 foot thick reinforced steel/concrete slab above the whole thing, but they knew one bomb could take out the whole thing. It was more for peace of mind than anything. It\u2019s remarkable, though. After the war there was no need for the bunker, so they just left, and then rooms were just left as they are. Churchill always had a cigar, but actually inhaled it infrequently. If someone brought up a bad idea Churchill would pretend to be deaf so the guy would have to repeat his dumb idea so the whole room could hear and his confidence could vanish. He was running a war, but he and the rest of the Brits still had time for style. Suit, hat, cigar, and entitlement; he wore all these things proudly. Even the pigeons here are entitled. I woulda stepped on one earlier had I not stopped quickly. It was walking directly across my path, and usually these silly animals see you and turn tail, but something was fowl with this one, and it just kept on bobbing its little birdbrain head with its chin held high and kept on going. I wanted to punt the little pecker across the footway. I was happy when one tried to walk in front of me one day and then slipped and fell on its little pigeon ass. Heh heh\u2026 anyways\u2014They watch House in the UK, so it doesn\u2019t seem like a coincidence that they love Chruchill, or do I have it backwards? Either way, he\u2019s a cool guy, and I\u2019m just discovering this now because I don\u2019t read books. Even amidst the daily bombings Churchill understood the importance of recreation. He always ended the night with a card game or a movie. I believe the queen at the time said \u201cKeep calm and carry on,\u201d which has become an internet meme now. It seems after the war Churchill spent a lot of his time coming up with good quotes. When you first walk into the museum it says on a wall, \u201cWe are all worms, but I believe I am a glow worm.\u201d</p>\n<p>We were tired of walking so me and Chris walked to a pub to watch the fastest man in the world. They\u2019re really fast. Bolt won again, but the world got faster.</p>\n<p><a title=\"Monday,\u00a06th\" href=\"http://allmostrelevant.com/2012/08/26/monday-6th/\">Next Day&gt;&gt;</a></p>\n", "post_id": 574, "location": false, "date": "08-26-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["triplog"], "text": "<p>We had the whole day to kill because our flight leaves at 9pm with an 11 hour layover in Amsterdam. I guess we weren\u2019t really paying attention to the whole am/pm thing when booking tickets. We had to check out and leave our bags in luggage starage at the hotel, but then headed out to a starbucks to start the day. It was just like our first day where we were on the internet at starbucks looking for stuff to do, except now we had energy. It\u2019s nice how things come full circle. We didn\u2019t have enough time for Stonehenge, which was a bummer, but we went to St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral, which is huge and ornate, and has one of the biggest domes I\u2019ve ever seen, but it\u2019s 15 lbs. to enter, so we saw what we could from the door and called it good. Walking around you see these red post boxes for the royal mail service. There\u2019s two slots for mail that\u2019s either \u201cstamped\u201d or \u201cfranked,\u201d as in having either been stamped, or having received the services of a man named Frank.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s also a shoe place that measures your foot and makes awesome shoes that custom fit to your feet. We tracked it down and looked at it. It was shoes, and we left. We got gelato and chilled in Green Park on the grass. There\u2019s a guy going around collecting payment of 1 pound an hour to use the lawn chairs, so screw that; grass is fine. We talked about how sports are a necessary part of civilization in that you need something to reach for, or at least something to distract us from wanting to kill each other. You need goals. Not everyone will have an impact of the world, and that\u2019s a tough thought to deal with, so sports are a way to take our minds off life, and distress. That\u2019s why people say \u201cIt\u2019s just a game\u201d when someone starts to take sports too seriously and gets really stressed out, because sports really don\u2019t matter\u2014the concept of sports matters\u2014but the individual events themselves really don\u2019t. We need sports and hobbies to give our minds time ti unwind, otherwise if all we did was work 24/7, we\u2019d go crazy. Churchill always made time to play cards or relax at night to keep a sound mind; it was written into his schedule. The same thing applies to our civilization. We need sports so that we don\u2019t go crazy as a whole. We need weekends, dinner and a movie, or any random activity that distracts us from work. Also, since we as people don\u2019t want to be bored, and instead strive for perfection, we use sports as an avenue for discovery of the limits of the human body. We are running faster, swimming farther, jumping higher every year. We are breaking world records like it\u2019s something that\u2019s supposed to happen. We learn about how to eat right, exercise more efficiently, and put mind over matter. In sports anything is possible. A long jumper can jump 28 feet because he thinks he can jump 40. This applies to anything. We think we can live on Mars, so we put a man on the moon to test it out, and we gained so much progress as a civilization. So many modern things we use today are made because of competition and the desire to stretch the limits. A Nintendo 64 has enough brain power to run the Apollo 11 mission. Think about that\u2026 I\u2019m getting a little side tracked, and this is turning into an editorial titled \u201cSports and Space,\u201d and now my butt\u2019s wet. I should\u2019ve gotten a lawn chair.</p>\n<p>Basically we lugged our luggage to the airport and got on a plane for a 45 minutes flight to Amsterdam, in the opposite direction of home. I just sat there for the whole flight because there wasn\u2019t much time anyways. It was KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. When they switched back and forth from Dutch to English a few words sounded funny, and some phrasings/rules seemed a bit off. \u201cThank you for your corporation.\u201d I forgot the others, but there was one rule in the safety video where if there is to be an evacuation you aren\u2019t allowed to take any of your belongings with you\u2026 because of course amoungst all the chaos and frantic disorder, the flight attendants will stop what they\u2019re doing and go out of their way to make sure you drop your bags. At the Amsterdam airport it was 11:00pm, and a ghost town. We thought we\u2019d have no place to eat, so we thought about sleep. We\u2019d heard there are \u201csleeping pods\u201d so we looked for\u2014oh, there they are. It was called \u201cYotel,\u201d and they had little tiny rooms that resembled something you might find aboard the Star Trek Ship. The beds start upright, like a couch, and then slide out and flatten out. We\u2019re in the Netherlands, so the beds are bigger, which is nice. The rooms had buttons on the side of the bed which would control the lights to different settings. If you pressed the sun it got light. If you pressed the computer it would get dim. If you pressed the book it gave you a reading light. If you pressed zzz it turned them all off. And if you pressed the heart a low fuchsia lighting would throb and sultry music would play. Well, that last part wasn\u2019t true, but there was a soft trim of fuchsia lighting; however that doesn\u2019t detract from it certainly being pictionary\u2019s finest hour. Although there was some soft repetitive thumping from one room over. It\u2019s one of those instances you\u2019re not quite sure what you\u2019re hearing, but you don\u2019t know if anyone else hears it, so you don\u2019t say anything, but then they\u2019re hearing the same thing and don\u2019t say anything because they don\u2019t want to be the one that hears it first, and neither do you, so you both just ignore it even though you know perfectly what it is. They must have purchased the 4 hour stay option. Anyways, one of the walls was one giant mirror in order to make the 10&#215;10 room seem bigger. I\u2019ve seen this trick before, and it works every time; the only drawback with this one is that in front of the mirror wall is a large panel of glass, and between that is the sink, the toilet, and the shower; and there\u2019s two of us. There haven\u2019t been many awkward situation on this trip, just a few big ones, so let\u2019s just skip through the night and get to tomorrow.</p>\n<p><a title=\"Tuesday,\u00a07th\" href=\"http://allmostrelevant.com/2012/08/26/tuesday-7th/\">Next Day&gt;&gt;</a></p>\n", "post_id": 576, "location": false, "date": "08-26-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["triplog"], "text": "<p>We had to go through security again because I don\u2019t know why. It takes an hour to get through, and so they started boarding at 8:55 even though the flight is scheduled for 10:30. Some girl was leaning against the glass wall to outside, but it was actually a door, and she tripped the alarm. I was loud, but nothing happened, someone just came and turned it off. You can trip a freaking alarm in an airport and everyone\u2019s cool, but god forbid if you have some change in your pocket we\u2019re going to search you.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m in the middle seat again, and oh look, threes seats to my left: baby. This one was of the screaming variety. It thinks everything belongs to it \u201cMine! Mine, mine, MINE!\u201d Babies are selfish. Probably the worst part of the flight though, is that 2.5 hours into it we were still on the ground. There was a discrepancy with how much fuel was added to the plane and how much it said was added, so they wanted to make sure we wouldn\u2019t crash somewhere over Greenland or something silly like that. The baby is screaming. I put my earphones in. For some reason only when I\u2019m on a plane and listening to music with these particular headphones the treble comes out much more than usual and for some reason I can hear the back-up guitar/keyboard tracks that I\u2019ve never heard before on the same songs I\u2019ve listened to over a hundred times. It\u2019s funny how you can know something so well for so long but still not know everything about it. I don\u2019t know if that analogy could be any more transparent.</p>\n<p>After two hours of checking the fuel levels manually, all they had to do was top it off for how much they burnt keeping the A/C and the advertisements on, and then we\u2019d be on our way. They have TV screens to distract their customer and keep them in a bland and happy stasis, but they don\u2019t turn them on \u2018til after takeoff. Once we finally started rolling, the flight attendant said \u201cWe will show you a beef safety presentation\u2026\u201d she must have been hungry too after 2 hours on the ground. The baby is screaming. When food started coming out the vegetarians got served first without explanation. The flight attendants were really sassy during this flight, and seemed impatient. We were watching movies with headphones in because the baby was screaming, so I wasn\u2019t paying attention to the aisle and didn\u2019t hear him meekly whisper without repeating, \u201cwould you like something to drink?\u201d I looked across the aisle and the other passengers had drinks, and the flight attendant guy was looking right at me and rolling his little cart away. I gave him a look like \u201cwhat the hell, aren\u2019t you serving drinks?\u201d and he replied, \u201cI asked you , but you guys were watching your shows, and I\u2019m just they guy with the cart, so\u2026\u201d \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t see\u2014I didn\u2019t hear you.\u201d \u201cWell yeah. I mean, I asked, but you guys didn\u2019t hear me.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cI asked but you didn\u2019t hear me.\u201d \u201cWell, sorry, I didn\u2019t even know you were there.\u201d (I was waiting for him to offer, \u2018would you like a drink now that we are all on the same page here?\u2019 but he kept running in circles as if I just missed out on my one shot to get a precious refreshment and I did something wrong.) so I asked explicitly, \u201cCould I get a coke and a water?\u201d he seemed so pissed off, like he didn\u2019t sign up for this or something. The next lady that came by for drinks a few hours later asked dad if he\u2019d want anything to drink, and he was watching a movie, but by the time I tapped him on the shoulder to get his attention the lady already moved on. She didn\u2019t even offer me a drink, or even look at me, even though I was staring straight at her. We got our drinks again, but it\u2019s just kind of funny. I have to be on edge. The flight attendants are all acting like they\u2019re in some big rush to get their work done so they can get off early, but I don\u2019t know where they\u2019d go. Even the trash collectors just crusied down the aisle from back to front, so by the time you see them they\u2019re already passed you; you\u2019d need ninja reflexes just to throw your drink away that you never got in the first place. The flight was actually quite nice despite being 12 hours. I\u2019m just bored, so I\u2019m picking nits. The baby is asleep. The weather in Seattle is 65 and over cast; perfect. The pilots always say whether the weather has good visibility or not, which really only matters if you\u2019re flying a plane at the time, and none of the passengers ever are, so no one gives a care.</p>\n<p>Apparently the last few days have been 80+, so I guess I\u2019ve dragged the weather with me again. We chased the midday sun all the way home, having left at 1:30 and touched down at 2 at home sweet home. We just beat rush hour back to the house, and I sat and watched the Eagle\u2019s play over the water, then passed out. And that, I suppose, is where the trip ends.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "post_id": 578, "location": false, "date": "08-26-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["malaria", "entity", "say", "cure", "they", "English", "raspberry", "blurb", "care"], "text": "<p>One of the more interesting entities of the English language is They. &#8220;Why are there no raspberry granola bars?&#8221; &#8220;Oh, They stopped making them.&#8221; &#8220;I heard the northern lights are dipping down to our latitude tonight.&#8221; &#8220;I thought They said tomorrow.&#8221; &#8220;They found a cure for Malaria.&#8221; &#8220;They say it&#8217;s better to be smart than beautiful, but They don&#8217;t know me.&#8221;\u00a0</p>\n<p>&#8230;Maybe it isn&#8217;t even that interesting or that big of a deal, but I don&#8217;t care what They say.</p>\n", "post_id": 601, "location": false, "date": "08-30-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["print", "quote", "life", "fine"], "text": "<p>&#8220;Life is in the fine print.&#8221;</p>\n", "post_id": 611, "location": false, "date": "09-05-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["quote", "fate"], "text": "<p>&#8220;Fate has a way of catching up with you.&#8221;</p>\n", "post_id": 616, "location": false, "date": "09-04-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["ranger", "6wStory", "arrangement"], "text": "<p>A ranger rearranged a deranged arrangement.</p>\n", "post_id": 619, "location": false, "date": "09-05-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["sing", "sign", "language", "blurb", "dyslexic"], "text": "<p>Being dyslexic, I have a terrible time trying to learn sing language.</p>\n", "post_id": 640, "location": false, "date": "09-08-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["body", "wheel", "dialogue", "metaphor", "relationship", "car", "head", "argument", "marriage", "useless", "compass", "steering"], "text": "<p>The steering wheel is useless unless you are moving.</p>\n<p>Yes, and the motor is useless if the first thing you do is crash.</p>\n<p>So why are we arguing?</p>\n<p>Because that&#8217;s the only way anything ever gets done.</p>\n<p>I mean, why are we arguing about this?

To find \u2018my narrative,\u2019 to see \u2018what I was all about,\u2019 to find something\u2014anything\u2026 I\u2019m not quite sure why. But nonetheless I started looking, and that\u2019s all that mattered.</p>\n<p>I drove up in the mountains today and hiked down to Hermit Falls. It was going to be a pleasant easy hike, but the catch is that I parked my car and started marching down at 6pm when the sun had cast half the canyon in a shadow already. Everyone was climbing back up the steep path and I was the only one walking down. I stopped here and there to look at the view. Someone was talking a quarter mile away down in the canyon, and I could hear them like they were right around the corner. You can hear people long before you notice them. By the time I reached the falls it was very dark. I didn\u2019t stop and stare too long because quite honestly I kept imagining that a bear would come for a drink and notice I would make for some nice evening hors d\u2019oeuvres. I figured the sun would set in about fifteen minutes, so I\u2019d have to move quick if I wanted to make it back in time.</p>\n<p>I ran back up using as much night vision as I could muster and ended up getting lost on an unfamiliar trail. I thought about the bulletin board I glanced at near the trailhead that read \u201cbear country\u201d and other stuff about wilderness. Every ounce of bear survival knowledge I knew rushed through my head. The hills were steep and there were little rocks jutting out of the trail every now and then, and were very hard to see once the sun had set completely. There was a constant buzzing and chirping of bugs, but I didn\u2019t get any bites. I kept thinking about how bears might go down to the creek for a drink at this hour because they know no humans would be on the trail. I just kept my eyes glued to the trail, focusing on where to place my feet as I jogged uphill one step at a time. I crossed the creek four times on the way back, and that\u2019s when it felt suspicious. I thought I\u2019d only crossed it three times on the way down. I felt the unfamiliar crunching of leaves beneath my feet that I hadn\u2019t felt before, and I knew I was off track \u2013 but didn\u2019t admit it because I didn\u2019t want it to be true.</p>\n<p>I came to a clearing with a sign that told me I was .75 miles off course. So much for that. I could either continue on a new 4 mile trail back to the parking lot, or backtrack through the unfamiliarity. There are a handful of secluded, and now abandoned cabins along the trail and creek, which might be why it\u2019s called Hermit Falls. I thought if I couldn\u2019t find my way back I could smash a window and stay the night next to a lonely skeleton in a house full of bats. I thought about how relieved I\u2019ll feel when I finally find my way back\u2026 I always do. Soon after I found the correct trail after being forced to slow down due to the dark and rocky nature of the, well&#8230; nature. I crossed back across the river and ran uphill into recognizable territory. I had run too fast before with blinders on and thus I had wandered onto the wrong path, forgetting to stop and look up every once in a while to check where I was. You lose your depth perception in the dark. For a while I thought if I looked up I would see a bear. A part of me wanted the blinders on.</p>\n<p>The moon was a little more than half full on a clear night, which after being in the shadows of shadows under the trees, made it delightfully easy to see. I stared at the moon and had to squint, which in a roundabout way brought a smile to my face as I ran the rest of the path out of the canyon. The shadows cast by the moon through the trees made it near impossible to tell where any rocks were jutting out of the ground from. But I just kept running with the expectation of tripping and falling, which somehow made it easy to keep on, because every second that I didn\u2019t fall I was very grateful. Occasionally there was a rustling in the bushes above me or a bat that silently whizzed by my head, but I just kept to the trail, grinding up the steep gradient; right, left, right, breathe, left, right, left, breathe\u2026</p>\n<p>I finally reached my car with a full appreciation for moonlight, and just stood there for a while, catching my breath and looking over the canyon. A few things crossed my mind:</p>\n<p>That was fun. It reminded me of when I would forge trails through the woods at the house I grew up in whenever I wanted to get away and de-stress. That brings me back.</p>\n<p>Does that mean I\u2019m stressed or want to get away? Maybe I just needed a thrill. It\u2019s been a while. Why would I <i>need</i> a thrill? Am I bored of normal life?</p>\n<p>So much could have gone wrong, but it didn\u2019t. I can only think God for that. Who else would pull me out of a dark canyon without a scratch on my body?</p>\n<p>Why did I do this? I didn\u2019t need to go run through a minefield of ankle sprains, but I did. I knew full well it would get dangerous and could hinder my career as an athlete, but I didn&#8217;t even consider the possible dangers.</p>\n<p>I did this alone. No one saw what just happened, or needs to know, or probably will know; but I know. Does that matter? To who?</p>\n<p>I started at my car and finished at my car, back where I started like nothing ever happened. This trek was just a side trip. It won\u2019t change the overall course of who I am or where I\u2019m going, but at least now I have a better understanding. I start and finish every day asleep in my bed, but I have different dreams every night.</p>\n<p>I think this run was an allegory\u2026 I think I get it now.</p>\n<p>\u2026At least I think I do.

I stared in amazement as the spectacle grew. Bright lights of blues, greens, and reds swept across the sky; tumbling, gyrating, climbing in the synchronized and syncopated patterns of my mind, and then the sky reverted to darkness. A father figure, or possibly a shrink, constantly had to tell me this spectacular lights show was all in my head, and nothing was real. I looked out into the sky again with conviction. I knew it wasn\u2019t all in my head, I could see the lights &#8212; there it is again, see? One of the stars began to oscillate, conducting the surrounding symphony of lights to awaken in gradual stages from the shroud of the night and coalesce in a dancing rhythmic display of vibrant energy. The lights felt close; a part of me. It was me and the lights; nothing else. A hand weighed upon my shoulder. A burdened voice, like an overflowing jar, told me I was imagining this &#8212; all of this: it isn\u2019t real. I looked upon the night sky again. I began to heave thick tears. I reached forward into the night sky, dark now, but instead fell to my knees. I watched for the lights. I was alone. Not even the heavy hand of the truthful man touched me.

At the terminal the lady said my bags needed to fit easily into the little sizer box thing, and I thought \u201cdoes it really matter if it fits easily? What if I have to kick it in, but it still fits?\u201d There\u2019s no point for style.</p>\n<p>There was a lady and her dog sitting next to me. I was wasting time on the internet and thought she was talking to her whining dog about flight information, but she was actually on the phone; however she then hung up and continued to talk to her dog about people stuff. She told a random person \u201cShe wants to say hi to you,\u201d and the person got out of their seat and went over to kneel down and kiss the dog\u2019s ring, or whatever the hell miss dog lady was expecting them to do.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe probably smells my dog.\u201d How many times have I heard that? Or maybe he smells your fragrant pants area.<br />\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s a she? Sorry, I didn\u2019t know.\u201d Ugh. It doesn\u2019t matter what gender it is if it is going to keep whining and barking on the plane. However, miss dog said the furry thing curls up in a bag and sleeps stowed under the seat in front. Fair enough.</p>\n<p>The PA system called \u201call passengers to board a flight to Phoenix, but I didn\u2019t want to go to Phoenix, so I got on the plane to Seattle when they told \u201call passengers\u201d to board that flight. I\u2019m pretty good at remember faces, and I saw a flight attendant that I recognize from two previous Alaska Airlines flights. I didn\u2019t look at her nametag because that\u2019d just be weird. The strangest way I can put this is that she has really big eye-wells, like her eyes are sunken into her face by the gradual tug of gravity due to the weight of her brain. Another flight attendant zoomed down the aisle without pause and told me to turn off my book. Suffice to say I was confused, and closed my book anyways. It\u2019s never given me confidence when they make us turn off our ipods and headphones on takeoff and landing, like listening to the latest hit by Taylor Swift will somehow send the plane into a tailspin. There are no babies near me. I am a happy man. I put on my noise cancelling head thingies and tried to nod off. It\u2019s strange getting used to noise cancelling headphones because the way it works is it essentially blares silence into your ears, so there\u2019s still pressure from sound waves in your ears even though there\u2019s no sound, like the feeling that my ears are constantly going to pop\u2026 or maybe I\u2019m on a plane.</p>\n<p>I landed in Seattle. It was weird because I didn\u2019t even step out of the airport. I didn\u2019t even check the weather; it was grey (is it \u201cgrey,\u201d or \u201cgray?\u201d). I rendezvoused rather seamlessly with mumsy and we checked the heavy stuff and walked through the non-existent security lines. For a moment I didn\u2019t know what to do because there was no line to file into. I just kind of stood there expecting to wait. When we got to the terminal I had to clarify to the jovial \u201cRunway Grill\u201d guy that I wanted 2 cheeseburgers, not just one. Mumsy thought he was Jamaican, but he was just from the city. Maybe he wishes he was from Jamaica. Runway Grill sounds like they cook burgers on the tarmac, which fortunately they tasted like they weren\u2019t. Initially I read \u201cRunaway Grill,\u201d which launched me towards a series of alternate themes for the restaurant.</p>\n<p>While eating, Mumsy and I wondered what you are supposed to call Icelandic people. Is it \u201cIcelanders,\u201d or is it something random and cool, like how Netherlands people are Dutch, Belgians speak Flemish, and New Zealanders are Kiwis. A bit of googling revealed it\u2019s just \u201cIcelanders.\u201d How disappointing. In the Iceland travel ads there\u2019s a package where you can go on a six day excursion to go \u201cknitting with the elves\u201d \u2013no joke\u2013 so I\u2019m just gonna call them \u2018elves\u2019 to stay entertained. There\u2019s a lot of folklore in them thar elfish hills, eventually leading our discussion to another important issue: what\u2019s the difference between elves and gnomes? I\u2019ve only known gnomes (knowmes?) as garden-dwelling dunces and have no knowledge of their folklore or mischeivery, but apparently google labels a gnome as a diminutive ground dwelling guardian of Earth\u2019s precious treasures or something like that \u2013 developed in Renaissance times. I didn\u2019t look up elves, but I\u2019ve seen the Keebler commercials from the 90\u2019s, so I\u2019m pretty well verse.</p>\n<p>Once on the plane and seated, the head of ground control got on the PA and joked that none of our bags were on the flight with us\u2026 except she wasn\u2019t joking. She explained that weather was looking bad in Iceland and we had to carry more fuel in case we\u2019d be forced to land in Glasgow instead. \u201cIn order to carry the extra weight, some luggage and passengers had to be eliminated.\u201d Her exact words. I thought I was flying \u2018Mafia Air\u2019 for a second. She continued to inform us through the ambiance of sighs, yelps, and a few \u201cF-you\u2019s,\u201d that our bags have been put on the next flight, and to make sure we fill out a lost baggage form when we land. I don\u2019t know why they would hold Us accountable for bags we didn\u2019t lose, but they are. The alternative solution was to stop in Canada for a refuel, but then people would miss their connections\u2026 I guess we night be going to Scottland.</p>\n<p><a title=\"Jan\u00a027th\" href=\"http://allmostrelevant.com/2013/02/12/jan-27th/\">(next day)</a></p>\n", "post_id": 910, "location": false, "date": "02-11-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["lifeguard", "blue", "reykjavik", "shoes", "relax", "iceland", "freezing", "hot", "experience", "writing", "water", "mud", "airport", "adventure", "lagoon", "spring", "exfoliate", "happy", "sunrise", "nap"], "text": "<p>Sunday, January 27th: good news: didn\u2019t end up in Scottland. Landed in Reykjavik as planned, but still without our bags (not as planned). So what that means, is since I like to relax and pack light on the plane ride by wearing slippers and light clothing, my shoes/boots and jacket are still in Seattle. Mumsy was smart and wore shoes and brought her jacket on the plane.</p>\n<p>We de-plained and I popped my contacts in and we verified with the elves chich bus to take. We had to wait an hour and got to watch the sunrise before our bus pulled in across the parking lot. There\u2019s something different about the sunrise here\u2026 it\u2019s blue. Not orange, not pink, not yellow, not tinted the wondrous hues of pollution, just\u2026 blue. There\u2019s something very simple about such a pure sunrise that I can\u2019t help but feel clean and refreshed to some degree, regardless of how I\u2019ve only slept 5 hours of the last 48.</p>\n<p>We waddled out into the parking lot. There was some ice on the land. The temperature isn\u2019t too bad, just low 30\u2019s, but the wind is rather biting. I stepped around the puddles with my slippers and knocked on the door of the bus going to the blue lagoon. The driver was sitting where the passengers do with his feet kicked up.</p>\n<p>We were the only ones to enjoy the flat drive through an unusual windswept terrain of jagged volcanic rock blanketed with thick green moss, and sprinkled with snow for texture. I\u2019ve heard there was a volcano somewhere and really wanted one of the small hills to blow up and start oozing lava. However we drove by a Subway and a Taco Bell/KFC, which was surprising enough.</p>\n<p>I\u2019d say the Blue Lagoon is a mystical place if I was forced to describe it. Amidst this rocky wasteland of untraversable landscape sites a milky, neon blue pool, the same color as the sunrise, steaming with mineral enriched geothermally heated goodness. In other words, it\u2019s nature\u2019s hot tub. Naturally the temperature of the hot springs is actually unbearable, so they have to mix cool water in it to make it livable.</p>\n<p>You walk out into the freezing weather with only your bathing suit and slide into the springs. The lifeguard is wearing ski pants, a ski jacket, and a face mask, walking around to stay warm. As long as you don\u2019t pull any wet body parts out of the water, you\u2019ll never get cold and could stay in there all day. I think we were in for about 2 hours. I got really wrinkly, like, puppy shar pei status.</p>\n<p>Walking around in the pool every now and then you\u2019ll stub your toe on something, but in one spot I was walking on what felt like slimey pillows squishing between my toes. The springs create a naturally occurring silica mud, which is white in color, and which you\u2019re supposed to put on your face to exfoliate. I don\u2019t even know what \u2018exfoliate\u2019 means, but I felt exfoliated. It was the most relaxing experience I\u2019ve had, maybe ever. Our bags had been lost and we couldn\u2019t do anything else, so all we could do is relax. I came out of the springs and slept for an hour on an indoor pool chair facing the sun. Nevermind that earlier statement: sleeping in that chair after being in a warm exfoliate natural hot spring was the most relaxed I\u2019ve ever been. My body had taken the opportunity to remind me what clock I was still following, and I never really snapped out of that sleepy Blagoon-induced relaxation for the rest of the day.</p>\n<p>We were driven to our hotel, took a nap, ate some food, and crashed. I don\u2019t usually recommend things out of the blue, but the blue sunrise, the blue water, the blue lagoon; well, it blue my mind.</p>\n<p><a title=\"January\u00a028th\" href=\"http://allmostrelevant.com/2013/02/12/january-28th/\">(next day)</a></p>\n", "post_id": 913, "location": false, "date": "02-12-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["art", "down", "prices", "earth", "church", "eriksson", "breakfast", "zoo", "sunrise", "gourmet", "god", "top", "fox", "snow", "lava", "writing", "to", "hot", "market", "skyr", "leif", "elves", "identical", "shopping", "gear", "food", "iceland", "hotel", "gas", "downtown", "contradictory", "adventure", "words", "flea", "whale", "hallgrimskirkja", "animals", "dog", "puffin", "wild"], "text": "<p>Monday, January 28th: Our bags came. Yay! Now Curtis finally gets to wear shoes!</p>\n<p>I suppose before going any farther I should make a few observations, or rather, state some trivia. 129 ISK (Icelandic Krona) is worth 1 USD, so 1000 ISK is just under $8, and 1.300 is about $10 (decimals are commas and commas are decimals, which I guess wouldn\u2019t make them decimals, but kilomals or something. And I supposed commas would just be comicals. *slapping the knee*) Names beginning with the letter \u201cC\u201d are not recognized by the Elvish government, and are technically \u2018illegal names\u2019 because the letter \u201cC\u201d isn\u2019t in the Elvish alphabet. If I was an Elf I would have to change my name to Kurtis. It kind of makes sense. The letter \u201cc\u201d kan always be replaste by an /s/, a /k/, or another gnu letter that makes the /ch/ sound\u2026 which phonetikally is really just the /sh/ sound with a quik /t/ in front of it. \u201cTshoo-tshoo goes the tshrain.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Elvish phonebook lists people by their first names. The sun rises in the SE, gets up to about two hands, and sets in the SW. And that\u2019s plenty for now.</p>\n<p>We broke fast with granola that you could put yoghurt, strawberry goop, apple goop, or figgy goop on, bread, cheese, hard boiled eggs, and ham; all cold. Knowing me, I made an Egg McGhetto and put the ham, egg, and cheese on the bread and consumed it suchly. The winds whipped white caps up from the bay, but the sun rose and calmed the weather a bit and we ventured by foot into Reykjavik.</p>\n<p>The language is strange, and if you weren\u2019t paying attention, sounds a lot like Dutch with some Russian sprinkled in. I thought about learning some, but gave up quickly after seeing the words \u201cvi\u00f0bj\u00f3\u00f0slegur\u201d and \u201cs\u00e9rst\u00e6r\u00f0arfarangur.\u201d We walked towards Hallgr\u00edmskirkja, which is the big landmark in Reykjavik. It\u2019s a church named after some guy named Hallgr\u00edms or something. I\u2019ve seen quite a few cathedrals and churches now, and the one thing that set this apart, besides its modern appearance on the outside, was how plain it was on the inside. It was tall and vast and grand as could be, but they weren\u2019t trying to show off, which was refreshing. The outside of the church paid tribute to the landscape by mimicking lava columns, where lava cools in hex/pentagon pillars (Devil\u2019s Tower in Wyoming has the same columns), and the inside, at least in my opinion, paid tribute to the personality of the elves; open, welcoming, and down to earth.</p>\n<p>Outside we tried to take a statue of the picture of Leif Eriksson, but a film crew whistled and yelled and told us to get out of the way. Spoiler alert: if you watch Top Gear, they\u2019ll have an episode involving Iceland and three huge old all-terrain trucks.</p>\n<p>We headed down good ol\u2019 Sk\u00f3lav\u00f6r\u00ac\u00f0ust\u00edgur street down to a popular flea market, but apparently it\u2019s only open on weekends. The wind was making my face cold so I got a souvenir scarf to wrap my head area in. We sought out the \u2018famous hotdog stand,\u2019 which was just a plain hotdog with some unknown Elvish sauce on it. Their claim to fame is that Bill Clinton ate a hotdog there once. It was good, but quite honestly Costco hotdogs are way better. The shops had really cool fur things though. If I had money to just burn and throw away, I\u2019d use that money to buy furry Elf slippers. But after all \u2013 \u2018what do I know about wearing the fur fox?\u2019</p>\n<p>We hopped a bus over to the other side of town (2 miles away\u2014honestly, Bellevue\u2019s bigger than Reykjavik) and walked on the icy paths to the local zoo. The sign said \u201cH\u00daSD\u00ddRAGAR\u00d0UR-FJ\u00d6LSKLDUGAR\u00d0UR.\u201d Mumsy joked and said it translates to \u201czoo.\u201d I laughed. However silly, she might be right. All the words and names for stuff are hellishly long around here. She said it\u2019s an island, like Hawaii, where they have long names that sound cool because they have lots of time to talk. And they\u2019re on \u2018island time,\u2019 like the sun, and get up late and go to bed early.</p>\n<p>I suppose Iceland and Hawaii do have a bit in common. Both are islands formed by \u201chotspots\u201d in the earth\u2019s crust, where the earth essentially leaks lava from one spot, and new islands start popping up as the tectonic plates move. That\u2019s why Hawaii is a trail of islands, and that\u2019s why a new island formed off the coast of Iceland in 2010 or whenever that happened. I don\u2019t know how Hawaii was discovered, but Iceland was discovered twice by two separate Vikings who accidentally drifted into it. the third guy went there on purpose and called it \u201csnowland,\u201d but left. The fourth guy went there to settle, and called it \u201cIceland\u201d because he saw ice floating near the land\u2026 true story. Vikings weren\u2019t known throughout history for being creative; they just went around claiming things.</p>\n<p>We walked back to our room via good ol\u2019 Kringlum\u00fdrarbraut street and took a brief nap before trying some exquisite Elvish cuisine. Cab fair is a bit pricey because gas is 2,58 ISK/liter, and if you\u2019re keeping track at home, that\u2019s roughly $7.68/gallon. The restaurant was called \u201c3 Fakkar,\u201d which I thought meant \u201c3 friars\u201d because the print ad had 3 friars on it, but when we walked in the menus had pictures of 3 guys in trench coats and seemed to use the character Rick from Casablanca as their mascot; so I didn\u2019t know what to think. On the walls they had trophies of just about everything on the menu except for whale. That would be ridiculous. Some of the options of animals to eat were cod, halibutt (&lt;&#8211;heehee. I said butt), salmon, shark, \u201cwild seabirds,\u201d puffin, whale, reindeer, lamb, and horse. So basically just about everything at the zoo was on the menu\u2013Oh! I forgot to mention the zoo:</p>\n<p>We saw animals. There were some pretty chill seals and two almost identical foxes; except one was snowy white and the other black like cooled lava. At first we only saw snow fox with its cute round fluffy face, but it quickly hid. We were turning away until I saw lava fox trotting towards us out the corner of my eye. It looked really curious and social, like it wanted to talk to us, probably because its camouflage is so good no one hardly ever notices it; everyone is drawn to snow fox instead. I wonder how many times people chase after snow fox because it\u2019s beauty is easier to see, and don\u2019t even notice the equally magnificent lava fox standing right in front of them? But enough about my personal life\u2014back to dinner!</p>\n<p>Mumsy chose the whale steak with pepper sauce, and I the wild sea birds with game sauce. They were delicious. We even had puffin as an appetizer. The meat is maroon colored. With mumsy\u2019s wealth of knowledge she said it must be rich in iron. We figured the elves eat all these strange animals because what else are you going to eat on the island? There ain\u2019t many choices. Even their potatoes are only bite-sized.</p>\n<p>For dessert was Skyr brule, like cr\u00e8me brule with yoghurt, and a little fruit called a cape gooseberry, which ornamented a dollop of whooping cream. The berry was most intriguing having the size and bite of a grape, the leaves of a turnip sprouting from its top (possibly grown underground), the texture and color of a tomato, and the taste of the ripest kiwi with a bit of citrus. A very confused and contradictory berry\u2026 maybe it was adopted.</p>\n<p>Back at the hotel we saw a post notifying today\u2019s tour group that the northern lights tour was cancelled due to weather. We originally were going to go on our tour today, but changed to tomorrow because we didn\u2019t know if we\u2019d have shoes and coats.<br />\nOn a quick side note, why is \u201c\u00fe\u201d a letter?

Well, I don\u2019t know how thirsty he was, but we were going on adventure time regardless. We got into a van that has windows and seats 16 people (16 mann). For a second it looked like we were getting into the windowless can for a tour \u201cwithout the hassle of having to turn your neck!\u201d I imagined we would drive up to something and he\u2019d say, \u201cOh wow, it\u2019s beautiful,\u201d and we\u2019d all squirm with excitement and hand him our cameras, then look at the pictures and go \u201cooh, ahh.\u201d</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t know\u2026 seemed post-modern enough to be true. I also thought that there ought to be a Dutch family out there somewhere in Dutchland that runs a minimal effort vanpool service, named the \u201cVanTour\u201d family (pronounced VonToor). So it\u2019d be \u201cThe VanTour Service,\u201d and you\u2019d get in the windowless van expecting a tour and be disappointed by the end of the ride, and Mr. VanTour would turn to you and say, \u201cWhat\u2019d you expect?\u201d</p>\n<p>To quote our guide: \u201cAnyhoo\u2026\u201d I learned many things on the two hour ride to Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull (including how to spell and pronounce \u201cEyjafjallaj\u00f6kull\u201d), all of which I will dryly recite in a blithering stream of bullet points throughout the following obtrusively droll paragraph. If you wishn\u2019t to dry out, I would strongly suggest skipping this paragraph.</p>\n<p>-Iceland has 320,000 pleople<br />\n-1871, guy builds first farm where downtown Reykjavik is now. Called the farm \u201cReykjavik,\u201d which means \u201csmokey bay.\u201d<br />\n-We passed large holes in the middle of a lava field called \u2018fake craters,\u2019 created when a lava flow meets water, and explodes.<br />\n-Tap water is filtered naturally through lava in the ground. They don\u2019t do anything to it except drink it. The tap is the same as the premium bottled water.<br />\n-It takes about 3000 years until trees grow after a lava flow. Iceland\u2019s very green because moss is sometimes the only thing that\u2019ll grow.<br />\n-11% of the country is lava field, like plain flat barren lava field, but everything is made from lava. The island is a volcano.<br />\n-Over half the country believes in elves. Like, actual elves. For real. It\u2019s a bit silly, but it\u2019s a part of their culture.<br />\n-We had to pull over to check our head lights. Sometimes it gets so windy your headlights will blow off.<br />\n-More often than not, when there is an eruption it happens in fissure line. All the mountains are made from fissures lines.<br />\n-Iceland is where the North American plate meets the Eurasian plates. They drift apart at 2 cm a day.<br />\n-There are small earthquakes every day, but since it\u2019s a constant steady diversion, they\u2019re rarely big and harmful.<br />\n-In the year 1000 the Elves were all pagans and the Danish royalty were trying to convert them to Christianity, but they wouldn\u2019t budge. There was a big eruption and lava flow and all the Elves converted to Christianity overnight and were baptized.<br />\n-They use steam from hot springs to heat water; nothing else.<br />\n-After everyone converted, all the chieftains (farm owners/rich guys) built small churches on their farms and served double-duty as priests. That\u2019s why there are so many churches in Iceland, and they only seat about 20-30 elves.<br />\n-Vatnaj\u00f6kull is the biggest glacier in Europe.<br />\n-The main requirement to be a glacier is that it must move.<br />\n-Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull means glacier (j\u00f6kull) on top of the mountain (fjalla) of the islands (eyja). The reference to the islands are the Vestmanneyjar (Westman Islands)<br />\n-The names always mean something; quite literally. The town of Hverager\u00f0i means hot spring (hvera) field (ger\u00f0i)<br />\n-The town of Hverager\u00f0i dropped 10 cm in a 2008 earthquake. Many hot springs disappeared, and some new ones formed; one in a women\u2019s backyard, so now they have a pool.<br />\n-Selfoss is the \u2018water-most\u2019 river in Iceland. Water is slightly green, which means there is glacier water present.<br />\n-Hekla is the most active volcano and holds the record for most ash produced over its life. It means \u201cgateway to hell.\u201d<br />\n-Elves don\u2019t have the letter \u201cW,\u201d and instead say /v/ like /w/, which makes Vikings sound like \u2018wikings.\u2019<br />\n-two \u201cL\u2019s\u201d together makes a hissing /k/ sound.<br />\n-\u201cFoss\u201d means \u201cwaterfall,\u201d and the river Selfoss is named that because seals (sel) would swim up to its waterfall and sit there.<br />\n-The sagas are their written history. Often the truth is stretched, but they\u2019re more or less accurate, kind of like a toned down version of the epic poetry of the greeks; history sprinkled with mythology.<br />\n-Ingolf was the guy who made the first farm in Reykjavik, and he left the location to destiny, picked by the gods. He had pillars with the gods carved in them and threw them into the ocean saying where they land, he will build a farm. His buddies searched the coast for over two years and found them washed up in Reykjavik.<br />\n-The town of Hvolsv\u00f6llur is where people are brought in an evacuation, but most eruptions are \u201ctourist-friendly,\u201d meaning people run towards the volcanos when they go boom, and not the opposite direction.<br />\n-The guide pronounces /sh/ like /s/, and most \u201ca\u2019s\u201d like \u201cu\u2019s\u201d, which puts the words \u201cash\u201d and \u201cfactory\u201d a bit out of context.<br />\n-Driving in ash is like driving on wet snow\u2026 you know, in case that ever happens to you and you\u2019re worried about driving conditions and not the fact that mother nature is vomiting on you.<br />\n-The defense mechanism, if you get too close to the white birds that fly around the waterfalls, is to vomit on you. It would work on me. That\u2019s just gross\u2014and unprofessional no less.<br />\n-Sk\u00f6galfoss (pronounced \u2018sk\u00f6wafoss\u2019) means \u201cwaterfall in the forest,\u201d but now the forest is gone due to lava flows\u2026 so now it just seems ironic and cruel.<br />\n-S\u00f6lheimaj\u00f6kull is the glacier we climbed, and is retreating 60m a year due to warmer climate, however it has scooped a \u2018U\u2019 shape in the valley; a telltale footprint of a glacier.</p>\n<p>OKAY!<br />\nThat was boring! Yet edjucational! \u2026wow, I just spelled education with a \u2018j,\u2019 like ed-yew-kay-shun-ull\u2026 I\u2019ve been staring at elvish words too long.</p>\n<p>Driving around Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull is quite a spectacle. The landscape is very flat, and then there\u2019s this huge plateau with a glacier on top of it. The hillsides of this mountain are sheer cliffs, and around every turn there\u2019s a new waterfall to look at. White birds speckle the green cliffs and dance around the waterfalls, and it\u2019s just keeps on going, like some never-ending national geographic magazine.</p>\n<p>So\u2026 now we\u2019re on the glacier S\u00f6lheimaj\u00f6kull. I know this is getting long, so I\u2019ll try to be quick, and probably fail miserably, but nonetheless I\u2019ll try. We put on crampons (\u2018crumpons\u2019) on our boots and got handed ice picks. The glacier was pretty amazing. It\u2019s not ice because it\u2019s cold, but rather because it has been compressed into ice\u2026 I worded that wrong, and there\u2019s no backspace on this pen, but basically that\u2019s why the bottom is liquid and allows the glacier to move. There are layers in the glacier. White is summer ice, and blue is winter ice. It\u2019s whiter in summer because more air bubbles get trapped int the ice, which is crystal clear. I posed for a photo under an ice cave and the guide told me \u201cnext time you\u2019re standing under 5 tonnes of ice: be quick.\u201d</p>\n<p>Walking on the ice was fun. Without crumpons, which are basically spikes the glacier would be one giant ash-bruising slip\u2019n\u2019slide, but with crumpons you can walk anywhere super easily. You have to walk flat footed, not rocking the usual \u201cheel-toe,\u2019 and have to kind of stab the ground as you step. The one thing to be careful of is to not fall down any crevasses or \u201cswallower.\u201d What swallowers are is when it rains and a stream flows down the glacier, it swirls like a drain and carves a funnel shaped hole all the way to the bottom of the glacier, sometimes up to 60 meters deep. It\u2019s called a swallower because once you slip, you get swallowed in and don\u2019t come out. Since the glacier churns and moves, they\u2019ve found cameras and ice picks imbedded in the walls years later. What I found cool, is that looking at the walls you can tell where summer and winter were, and where certain eruptions marked the glacier, like rings on a tree. There was a thin black line through the wall which was a layer of ass from the 1918 eruption. Where the line met the surface we were able to collect some ass (don\u2019t tell anyone). I felt like a spy and a geologist in that moment\u2026 a spyologist.</p>\n<p>*clears throat* excuse me. I seem to\u2019ve had a pun stuck in my throat.</p>\n<p>So we watched the sun set frm atop the glacier, and got down. It was windy. We saw a waterfall at night. I for the name of it, but it was pronounced \u201cSELL-you-Lance-foss.\u201d It was pretty cool.</p>\n<p>For dinner we stopped at a small restaurant in someone\u2019s farm and ate lamb soup. It was good. We then drove back towards Reykjavik in hopes of finding the northern lights, which was basically the whole reason for the trip. The forecast for the northern lights said there would be a north-facing gap in the sky, but on a scale from 0-9, where 0 is just stars, and 9 is the sky is on fire, the activity was 0, so we just looked at the stars. Our guide kept us entertained/destracted by telling us stories, including one folk tale of how a girl, Ketla, had magic pants that would allow her to run without getting tired, and she ended up running off into the forest by a volcano because she was a rebellious teen or something, and disappeared because of some sort of moral in the story. But she didn\u2019t die; she turned into a troll. So whenever she gets mad the volcano, now named after her, erupts. You could say the volcano is temperamental \u2018period\u2019ically.</p>\n<p>That was tasteless. Moving on: So\u2026 No northern lights, but mumsy did point out a dull white spot throbbing gently on the horizon. You\u2019d have to be crazy to see it. What I mean is it was so dim you\u2019d think it was nothing, and you probably wouldn\u2019t bother saying \u201cI see them,\u201d because no one would believe you. But she pointed it out and I stared in that direction. Through a diffusing layer of cloud cover I could make out the irregular white light. I\u2019d like to think that it was the northern lights. I may not have seen their complete brilliance, but that\u2019s just all the more reason to come back.</p>\n<p><a title=\"January\u00a030th\" href=\"http://allmostrelevant.com/2013/02/13/january-30th/\">(next day)</a></p>\n", "post_id": 917, "location": false, "date": "02-13-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["shop", "reykjavik", "tired", "fish", "walk", "down", "winding", "keflavik", "moral", "Christmas", "end", "ornament", "safety", "shuttle", "net", "conclusion", "shopping", "iceland", "downtown", "adventure", "natural", "organic", "airport", "harpa", "wind"], "text": "<p>Wednesday, January 30th: We had a few hours to kill in the morning before getting shipped to the airport, so we walked into downtown for a bit of shopping and sightseeing shenanigans and shin-diggery.</p>\n<p>The winds were calmer today \u2013still biting\u2014but I didn\u2019t need to wear a scarf.

Within about 50 paces down one stretch of sidewalk the wind blew from the left, then the front and blow my hood off, then the right, and then from the back and blew my hood back on and proceeded to push me along the sidewalk.

I don\u2019t either; but I have a few ideas, and they\u2019re unreasonable (that being the idea of addiction). So when I talk about addiction, I rather like to talk about the propensity to be/get attached to something. I could probably look up the definition and shed some interesting light on what it \u2018means,\u2019 saying it\u2019s worse or better than you thought; but that\u2019s not my style.

Caffeine seems to be the largest common ground. You drink coffee, you stay awake. You drink coffee, you\u2019re still sleepy, you drink more. Now you\u2019re awake. You\u2019re probably somewhat dependent on coffee now. When you get a headache and can\u2019t sleep at night and need coffee to calm you\u2026now you\u2019re addicted. I\u2019m know scientist, so the way I personally categorize addiction is when it starts to affect you; become a part of you. Something that defines you. For example my current addictions are badminton and bejeweled. Badminton is easily justifiable because I can say \u201cI\u2019m getting exercise too,\u201d so it\u2019s not so bad. However if I don\u2019t swing a racket for several days I get anxious and unpleasant. It\u2019s hard to pin down because I could say badminton is stress relief and that I haven&#8217;t been &#8216;releasing stress,&#8217; but I think it\u2019s a part of me. Bejeweled on the other hand I just play incessantly when I could be doing other things. I have no excuse for bejeweled. I\u2019ve wasted days on that game, and I\u2019m the best at it, too; but all for naught. Since there is a leader board I can stay on the top of it, and I think knowing daily that I\u2019m better than everyone else makes me happy. I need to be perfect. I might be addicted to myself. I don\u2019t want to say that because I don\u2019t want to say that, but I do in fact like myself. I think I\u2019m an alright guy. What\u2019s wrong with being better?

He would study how the legs would keep moving after he removed them, and would sort them into piles of wigglers, non-wigglers, and pop the legless bodies in his mouth. 15 years later he would learn that daddy long legs spiders carry venom approximately 600 times more potent than a black widow spider, but they are incapable of biting humans, rendering them harmless; but he still wondered why he didn\u2019t die after eating the entire spider along with all its venom. Donald would learn 20 years later that he was misinformed, and that daddy long legs spiders are harmless because they in fact don&#8217;t have any venom at all.</p>\n<p>Upon moving to first grade, to a different school in a different neighborhood with different people, Donald noticed that no one ate insects anymore; they just watched them. On the first day of school Donald saw two insects fighting and decided to break up the fight by squishing them. This was the first time a complete stranger had gone out of her way to tell him a question.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow would <i>you</i> like it if <i>you</i> were squished by a giant foot?\u201d Donald had not learned what puns were yet, so he couldn\u2019t say \u2018I would feel <i>depressed</i>,\u2019 but he still had some manner of wits about him, and replied,</p>\n<p>\u201cI squished them with my shoe, not my foot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes it does.

He\u2019s making fun of me!\u201d</p>\n<p>This confused Donald on two accounts: the first because he had no idea why the girl, unprovoked, would shriek; and secondly because he was a very literal child and was in fact not having any fun on this girl\u2019s behalf, nor was she transforming into any derivative of the greater concept of fun. Donald felt that either this girl\u2019s choice of words, or her line of thinking were poorly misguided, and he rebutted on the matter:</p>\n<p>\u201cNuh-uh!\u201d</p>\n<p>Donald was simply trying to prevent an insect war, but apparently this little girl had nothing to do but complain during recess.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d Ms. Schneider lumbered over with an invisible cane.</p>\n<p>\u201cDonald.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDonald, can you come with me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Donald was glad this peculiar woman with the loyalty of an abused dog had pulled him away from the girl, but he was completely unaware that every time someone followed the Duty, that she lead them to the principal\u2019s office. Donald was, again, confused as to the situation that presented him. In this wonderful country of checks and balances and democracy and freedom where those who are persecuted are innocent until proven guilty, Donald was now subjected to stay after school for \u2018making fun\u2019 of that girl. He didn\u2019t even know her, and it was in that moment he learned never to underestimate the power of a little girl.</p>\n<p>Donald was inexplicably afraid to hold eye contact with anyone, for reasons unknown to him in his present age, which didn\u2019t help his case as he tried to explain to this grown man with a patch of hair on his chin that he didn\u2019t actually <em>make</em> any fun; and even if he did, he wondered why he would be forced to stay inside for making fun? \u201cIsn\u2019t the point of recess to have fun?\u201d</p>\n<p>The principal\u2019s stomach growled and he wanted to finish his sandwich before he had to go class to class introducing himself in a fun and friendly manner, and so he settled on telling Donald,</p>\n<p>\u201cI think you might have a different idea of fun than the rest of the kids.\u201d</p>\n<p>Which was true, but also not a bad thing. After all, Donald was the only one pacifying insect wars on the playground. Donald was sent back to the classroom and realized that during all the explaining that was just done to him by the principal, nothing was explained. He wondered if he could be a principal some day and sit in a room and not explain things to confused kids as they were delivered to his door. He thought he could do that now, but he didn\u2019t have enough hair on his chin. He wondered if he shouted for the Duty their roles would have been reversed and if he could have enjoyed the rest of his recess, but first Donald had to get back for arts and crafts time\u2026</p>\n", "post_id": 958, "location": false, "date": "03-12-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["blurb"], "text": "<p>I went over to a friend&#8217;s house to work on a project.

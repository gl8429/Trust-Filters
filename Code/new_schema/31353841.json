It\u2019s not exactly a large rock and most men here are either A. covered in tattoos and wear jeans and flip-flops\u00a0to the gym B. are in (and obsessed with) the military or C. work with me in TFA. All three are baddd directions to go in. Trust me. Ok, so I haven\u2019t tried option A, but some assumptions and judgments just have to be made.</p>\n<p>Also on the plate: I have officially been swayed (by a very trustworthy source, might I add) to try out a certain online dating site. Let\u2019s just call it Bokay\u00a0Poopid. Don\u2019t laugh. I was extremely hesitant about this endeavor, but finally took the leap after realizing that, in my current life, the only way to meet a person of the opposite sex is drunk downtown or at Foodland\u00a0(no such luck in the cereal\u00a0aisle). So Bokay\u00a0Poopid it was. Worth it, you ask? Well, the free dinners have been nice. Some conversations have been great. But what it all comes down to is\u2026the craziest, most ridiculous, insanely sketchy, creepy as hell messages I\u2019ve ever read in my life. Let\u2019s review a few experiences so you understand the magnitude of this situation, shall we?</p>\n<p><strong>Ex. #1:</strong> \u201cHow do you feel about guys doing you with a strap on?\u201d This gem went on to talk about penis size (and offered to send picture proof). Thank god there\u2019s a block button. What. The. Hell.</p>\n<p><strong>Ex. #2:</strong> \u201cI buy you a horse.\u201d That\u2019s it\u2014that was the entire message. I think it might\u2019ve been in reference to me being from Texas, but then again, could\u2019ve just been a sugar daddy with a ranch. When I read the message, in my mind he had a heavy foreign accent\u2026because he didn\u2019t say, \u201cI would like to buy you a large animal to ride about\u201d or \u201cWould you like a thoroughbred complete with a saddle and stable?\u201d Nope, just, \u201cI buy you a horse.\u201d Looking back, I really should\u2019ve messaged. I\u2019ve always wanted a horse.</p>\n<p><strong>Ex. #3:</strong> \u201cHow do you feel about egg salad sandwiches?\u201d I did message this guy back, to ask him if it would be a deal breaker if I didn\u2019t like them (because I don\u2019t). To really throw him for a loop, I mentioned my love for tuna salad, preferably made with Miracle Whip.</p>\n<p><strong>Ex. #4:</strong> I go on a date with a guy who seems completely nice, normal, and smart. He casually mentions mid-meal that he\u2019s shipping off to Afghanistan in a mere week. Thanks, bro.</p>\n<p><strong>Ex. #5:</strong> First date, the guy asks if I have any weed. WINNER.</p>\n<p>There have been more, sadly, but let\u2019s stop at 5. The point is, Foodland\u00a0isn\u2019t working out, the bar scene is definitely not working out (\u201cOh you\u2019re a teacher? I bet you get a lot of apples, huh? Get it? \u2018Cause you\u2019re cute.\u201d SHUT. UP!), and Bokay\u00a0Poopid is obviously not working out either. Thanks Life, you\u2019re the bomb.</p>\n<p>Also, for the record, it\u2019s not just me. My friends, since being on this anti-Cupid of an island have:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Dated a guy and then been dumped via email.</li>\n<li>Met a guy for coffee and afterwards he basically tried to force her into his car. Near-rape is always fun. Ladies, if you live here, start carrying some pepper spray.</li>\n<li>Been set up with a wildly attractive man who turned into somewhat of a Clinger Stage Five. \u201cCan I see you every second of every day for the next, say, rest of our lives?\u201d</li>\n<li>Had love professed to them by coworkers or friends who have not a chance in hell and they now have to awkwardly keep seeing that person.</li>\n<li>Started to like or date the roommate or best friend of said awkward person.</li>\n<li>Dated and cheated on two people at the same time. \u201cYou will be my M-W-F. You will be my T-Th-S.\u201d</li>\n<li>Have broken long distance relationships off because the fact that we\u2019re thousands of miles away from any other civilization is hard.</li>\n<li>Have tried the whole friends with benefits thing (not smart).</li>\n<li>One night stands, nuff said.</li>\n<li>Have thought seriously about hooking up with their roommate. Icky.</li>\n<li>Have been a tourist\u2019s personal \u201cguide\u201d\u2026Poor, unsuspecting vacationers.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Do I really need to go on?</p>\n<p>The fact is, this island is cursed. CURSED I TELL YOU. At least I\u2019m not alone in this. Maybe this is part of \u201cisland fever\u201d that no one told us before moving to \u201cparadise\u201d?</p>\n<p>What are our options, you ask? Well, Lesbianism is out unfortunately. I wish it were that easy. Moving is out as well, I\u2019m sticking out this two-year\u00a0contract even if it crushes my body and soul! Bokay\u00a0Poopid was disabled after the \u201cI want to get you into a shower\u201d message I got the other day, but desperation might make me enable it again I\u2019m sure.</p>\n<p>The only real option is to get over it, to accept the fact that for the next year and a half of my life, I\u2019m going to be on this loveless rock, having hilarious dating experiences that make exceptional stories and pretty damn funny blogs. I can live with that. There&#8217;s also the the lesser known option D; carless, dorm-living, undergrad UH student. Don\u2019t worry, he\u2019s legal. I\u2019ll let you know how it goes.</p>\n<p>It helps that I have amazing friends going through the same crap (if not worse).\u00a0Not to mention, we\u00a0have wine and lots of it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47aS3uSCHLc\">&#8220;If I met Ryan Gosling, he&#8217;d wanna build me a house.&#8221;</a></p>\n", "post_id": 118, "location": false, "date": "02-07-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["faith", "Teach For America", "student", "TFA", "failure", "government housing", "teaching"], "text": "<p>I had never been inside the gates of government housing, much less into an actual apartment. But I had to meet DJ\u2019s parents. DJ, or Danu, who had just spent a whole hour after school with me, perfecting his essay while humming rap songs, picking at the scrapes on his arms, and drumming on his desk. He had jumped at the chance to get a ride home, but begged me not to come up into building seven. Too bad, so sad. I was going to light some kind of fire, I was so confident. This was step one in my na\u00efve \u00a0plan. The parents would see how invested I was and they would therefore also become super involved in DJ\u2019s English skills. It was going to work like magic. I was smiling as I climbed rusted steps, lined with \u201cslippahs\u201d.</p>\n<p>DJ walked through the open door and shot upstairs, jerking a thumb towards me before he disappeared. I tiptoed in quietly, not sure if I should wait outside. I looked in the direction that his thumb had jutted toward. I saw a glimpse of two brown faces and four brown eyes. \u201cHi! I\u2019m Alysha, I\u2019m DJ\u2019s English teacher!\u201d\u00a0 The open windows washed a breeze over everything. Flies floated around the furniture. I tried to direct my gaze only on his parents, not the large pile of dirty laundry next to the stove or the molded dishes in the sink.</p>\n<p>No one said a word. There was a sound from both of them, I guess an acknowledgement of my presence. But I couldn\u2019t discern if it was a grunt, a dismissal, or a standard greeting used for all. Dad pulled his shirt down, still not covering a huge, hairy belly. Mom got up off the couch reluctantly, leading me back out through the front door. A little girl appeared, her innocent smile reminding me of that same feeling of childhood excitement I see in DJ sometimes. \u201cOoh, look, a teacher!\u201d Her pony tail bounced and her eyes popped. DJ\u2019s eyes. I wanted to scoop her up and hug her tight and whisper in her tiny ear to never give up, because I already believed in her and her seashell earrings.</p>\n<p>Mom still hadn\u2019t said a word. DJ had finally joined us, peeking from behind the doorframe as I started an uncomfortable spiel. Her son was great. Her son had shown such, such incredible improvement. Her son was so smart, had such potential. I could see a sly grin appearing and disappearing from inside.</p>\n<p>She gave that same grumble, almost inaudible, with a nod this time. She never looked into my eyes. In fact, she looked pissed, like I had just ranted about the complete opposite. I briefly wondered if my words could\u2019ve somehow been misinterpreted. But no, I had been crystal clear; your son rocks. My whole body was burning, not because of the midday Hawaiian heat. I wanted to send spit flying at her neck tattoo and gold chain, I wanted to scream at all 300 pounds of her, \u201cBE PROUD OF HIM! LOOK AT ME! LOOK AT HIM! BE PROUD OF HIM YOU STUPID COW!\u201d Because I sure as hell am. And I shouldn\u2019t have to be the only one.</p>\n<p>I said my goodbyes and nice-to-meet-yous and plastered on a fake smile, waving to DJ and his little sister as I made my way back to my car, completely dejected. I wanted to break down. I wanted to sob in fury and disappointment. But I couldn\u2019t. I wanted even more to be like DJ; strong in the face of a situation in which I should be my weakest.</p>\n<p>The next day, he cussed in class, daydreamed through half of the notes, and tried to hide in the closet after the bell rang. The usual drill. But he passed that freakin\u2019 essay, the highest grade he\u2019s ever made on any writing. I pulled him aside and told him how proud I was. He shrugged me off and sauntered away, but not before I saw that same giddy grin lined with dimples. He was proud of himself too. And you know what I realized? Two people having that kind of faith in an almost-failing 12-year old student\u00a0is better than none. And if there aren\u2019t more now, there will be.

I see their teeth, their glow, their hands squeezing. I could reach out and touch the happiness if I wanted.</p>\n<p>I can\u2019t help but wonder: is bliss inversely related to the emptiness of a grocery cart?</p>\n<p>I look again at my milk, sweating onto the green plastic bottom of my basket. <em>Perhaps.</em></p>\n<p>Then the baby starts wailing, simultaneously causing 20+ magazines to crash to the tiled floor with one sweep of her miniature leg.

My grandma teaches me about it every Monday and Wednesday, when I spend the night to save a little gas. She lives right by my office, in the same house she&#8217;s been in since she was young and working, having babies, married, and happy from what I hear. Now it&#8217;s the same house, but empty and stale, just her and two snoring dogs and one annoying, chirping bird. It used to be filled with laughter and cooking. Now it&#8217;s filled with stuff&#8230;stuff that she stares at and then says, &#8220;I wonder who will ever want this once I&#8217;m gone&#8230;&#8221; Stuff like her teapot collection, her spoon collection, her stamp collection, and her Princess Diana doll.</div>\n<div>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I always say, &#8220;Grandma, you don&#8217;t even need to be thinking about that, it&#8217;s too early,&#8221; even though I know it&#8217;s not. And now the only cooking she does is toast with blackberry jam. She drinks her tea, eats from a tin of English cookies, and always has a full bowl of fruit on the table ready to be a centerpiece for the guests who never come.

She tells me about her only true love, buried in England, never really knowing how she felt. Her pale blue eyes are lost in 60+ year-old memories, forgetting I&#8217;m there. At that moment, I wish with all my might that she&#8217;s right in believing that Heaven exists, just so she&#8217;ll get to tell him, to be with him. She believes in God but not love.

Now the stores all have their own brand and that&#8217;s all you can find,&#8221; she says, shaking her head sadly at a box of blueberry muffins. &#8220;But your generation doesn&#8217;t care about that kind of stuff, do you?&#8221; I shrug my shoulders and grin.</div>\n<div>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What am I supposed to say to that?

We\u2019d travel to Tuscany and throw around a ball and befriend a cool tranny named Theodore, who would take us to the theatre.

How sad, but true is that? When she first said it, I thought it was hilarious of course, as are most things that come out of her mouth, but I didn\u2019t take it seriously. After all, getting excited about things is\u2026well, fun. Getting excited means smiling and laughing and butterflies and anticipation. How boring would life be without excitement?</p>\n<p>But then again\u2026the quote is 100% true. Our lives would be simpler and easier if we never allowed ourselves to get excited about anything. Think about it. You\u2019d never have ANY expectations, no unrealistic fantasies, zero delusions about experiences that family or friends or media have hammered into your minds since birth\u2026</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s take a few examples from my life:</p>\n<p><em>1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </em><strong>Life After College</strong>. Oh my lord, I thought immediately after I was handed that diploma that my life would basically start exploding into fireworks of adventure, fortune, and happiness. I built up life after college SO much\u2014not only in the four years at Texas State, but also in high school, and probably before that too. This is the supreme example of how getting excited about something screwed me over. I realized pretty quickly that <em>Oh, wait\u2026I didn\u2019t find the perfect husband in college. Oh, wait\u2026I don\u2019t have a fabulous dream job lined up. Oh wait, I\u2019m still living in a shitty apartment selling clothes for a horrendous hourly wage? </em>If I hadn\u2019t been so excited, maybe this time in my life would\u2019ve been seen as relaxing and full of possibilities instead of hopeless and a huge, huge disappointment.</p>\n<p><em>2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </em><strong>Moving To Hawaii</strong>. Yes, Hawaii was my first choice when I applied for TFA. The rest of my top ten cities were big and bustling, most of which I had never even been to. Why? Because this was going to be THE BEST TWO YEARS OF MY LIFE! This experience was going to be LEGEN-wait for it-DARY! Oh, I got my first choice city? Of course I did, because these two years were going to be filled with getting a tan, travelling between islands, being a kickass teacher, finishing grad school like a boss, and meeting\u00a0 beautiful surfers (one of whom would become my boyfriend, of course). It\u2019s a little ridiculous how excited I was about moving here. And c\u2019mon, I had great reason\u2014this is paradise, this is one of the top honeymoon spots, this place has no real winter! BUT (there\u2019s always a but when you get too excited), this has of course been the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. This is the most I\u2019ve ever complained, stressed, lacked sleep, had migraines that are out of this world\u2026and I can\u2019t help but wonder\u2026would it be this challenging if I hadn\u2019t built it up so much in my head, convincing myself that it was going to be PERFECTION?</p>\n<p><em>3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </em><strong>Relationships</strong>. If you haven\u2019t read my blog \u201cDating on an Island,\u201d go read it\u2026If you\u2019ve read it, then I really don\u2019t need to say anything else right now. You get it. Dating sucks, people suck, having high expectations sucks, getting disappointed time after time sucks. But hey, if I don\u2019t like it, I should just stop getting excited about relationships, right? Cutting out this aspect leaves us heartbreak free. If we don\u2019t get excited, we therefore won\u2019t get crushed. Plus, no matter what sleazy or slimy or downright disturbing words or actions someone directs toward you, you won\u2019t be fazed! Because you weren\u2019t excited anyway! Ahh, the liberation.<em></em></p>\n<p>The problem is, none of this is actually possible. We\u2019re wired a little differently than that, unfortunately. No matter how much my friend can say \u201cNever get excited about anything, and then you\u2019ll be pleasantly surprised by everything,\u201d she\u2019ll never actually, truly be able to live by it, nor<a href=\"http://alyshakaye.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/th411.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-257\" title=\"I like you, Twain.\" src=\"https://alyshakaye.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/th411.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a> will I or you or anyone.</p>\n<p>We\u2019re programmed to get excited, to get our hopes up, to anticipate the best, and to be severely disappointed when again, something is, instead, the worst.</p>\n<p>But who the hell cares.

The clich\u00e9, <em>what if I would have been with her for five more minutes? </em>Then you would\u2019ve been on the highway five minutes later, and then there\u2019d be no wreck. Or you\u2019d be stuck in traffic because of a wreck killing somebody else\u2019s girlfriend. But seriously, what if I would\u2019ve kissed you goodbye one more time? A long, 30-second kiss. Taking off all of your Bath and Body Works \u201cCake Icing.\u201d Would that have made a difference?</p>\n<p>Someone had taken your shoes and placed them neatly by a police car.</p>\n<p>\u201cYoung man, I think it\u2019s time you head home,\u201d some officer gripped my shoulder. I could feel his wedding band through my shirt and I wanted so badly to be standing in front of you in a white dress instead of you covered up with a white sheet.</p>\n<p>I was hugging the yellow flats I bought you that year I worked at Journey\u2019s for minimum wage. You told me that was the stupidest job ever for a \u201cwhite male college junior.\u201d You told me to go apply at a bank, and I finally did.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you hear me, son?\u201d</p>\n<p>I glanced at the 52 card pickup of \u201cMonty the Mazda.\u201d You always had to name your cars. And then I headed home to curl up in bed, surrounded by everything you had ever left at my apartment.</p>\n<p>Eventually, I took the shoes off my desk and put them in the box in my closet with all of our pictures. You forgot to take the sticker off the left one, I did that for you. It was dirty and faded, $24.99 Size 7. Later, I took the sticker out of the trash and smoothed it back on the bottom of the heel. One of the corners refused to stick, curling up, no matter how many times I laid it flat. I kissed it over and over for hours, tears soaking into every inch of yellow.</p>\n", "post_id": 275, "location": false, "date": "03-16-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["cry", "hawaii", "ocean", "tears", "cure", "sweat", "sea", "salt", "happiness"], "text": "<blockquote><p>&#8220;The cure for anything is salt water: tears, sweat, or the sea.&#8221; -Isak Dinesen</p></blockquote>\n<p>Previous experiments that have resulted in favor of this quote:</p>\n<p>#1 Hated my job and craved a worthwhile, impacting career change.

Go to the gym and sweat profusely on an elliptical while watching The Voice, The Soup, or really anything that starts with The. Did it work? Hell yeah!</p>\n<p>#3 I used to cry a LOT when my feelings were hurt. Mainly, crying helped when I cried so much that my body literally couldn\u2019t produce any more salty water. That\u2019s when I\u2019d pick myself up, take a shower, make a snack, and move the fuck on. Did it work? Hell yeah!</p>\n<p>Future ways I shall test this theory:</p>\n<p>1. Next time my students are really grinding my gears, I\u2019m going to throw my hands up, give the lesson plan to the nearest and dearest teacher\u2019s pet, and book it to North Shore.</p>\n<p>2. Things that make you sweat: hiking, lying on the roof in summer, street fighting, sex. Try it all, man. One of them\u2019s bound to work.</p>\n<p>3. Ok so I have to be honest, I haven\u2019t cried in a LONG time, which is awesome and also sad (I\u2019ve become a wee bit cold and heartless, it\u2019s fine). But I\u2019m sure if I need to shed a tear or two, I\u2019ll do it and it\u2019ll work. Fresh idea\u2014start crying out of happiness. This sounds much more pleasant.</p>\n<p>4.

Example: go skinny dipping in Lanikai, then climb Stairway, then cry at the sheer beauty of the sunrise?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Here\u2019s another question. I see the power of this quote. But how far could it go? Can we cure world hunger with salt water? Gang violence? Animal abuse? Racism? THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS. Send the rapists to Maui, create a new viral TV show called \u201cSweat Out Your Murderous Streak,\u201d and play The Notebook on repeat until pedophiles weep the pedophilia right out.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Seriously though, I am a firm believer in this whole thing. Salt water. It\u2019s genius. What a perfect day\u2014being near the sea, feeling super accomplished because you\u2019re sweating (don\u2019t you always feel accomplished whilst sweating, even if it\u2019s disgusting?), and something happens that makes you SO incredibly happy that you cry, just a little bit.

For the past couple of years, I\u2019ve been in and out of short bursts of flings and things. Who knows what you could even call them. But they definitely haven\u2019t lasted this long, AKA long enough for me to start worrying about liking someone too much, getting attached, getting hurt, blah blah\u00a0blah, etc. etc. It\u2019s a little frightening how much we have to worry about these things, now that we\u2019re at this stage in our lives. Some people still see themselves as young and invincible, but I\u2019m definitely feeling a bit worn down. I don\u2019t think anyone should have to have their heart ripped out more than once, that\u2019s just not fair. Therefore, I will not be signing myself up for a second go-around, and I think that\u2019s most people\u2019s sentiment. So what do we do when we start getting that sickening irking in our gut that\u2019s saying, \u201cHey you! You\u2019re about to fall face first you idiot! Get outta there!\u201d? Do we listen, and run like little chicken shits? It\u2019s an option.</p>\n<p>Option #2: Let the pieces fall. Take the risk. Put my heart on the chopping block right when it\u2019s finally become whole again. THIS IS NOT AN OPTION. Obviously.</p>\n<p>So that brings us to Option #3. Don\u2019t run like a little bitch, and don\u2019t put all my eggs in one basket either. The blissful in-between. The gray area that, for most, is impossible to stay in for too long. Well fuck that\u2014I\u2019m going to stay in it for as long as I damn well please. Maybe this means we can stay in the \u201cbeautiful early step in the wrong direction\u201d for the entirety of whatever this is. No fighting, no boredom, no strings. Is this even possible? Challenge accepted!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It took about a day after that to realize that I was fighting for an impossible, unrealistic dream. Sure, I can keep it up for a little while longer. Hide the emotions, play it cool, pretend not to care. But I\u2019m not built to bottle things up. So this is what the options change to for those of us who aren\u2019t very in control\u2026</p>\n<p>Option #1 becomes running <em>after</em> you can\u2019t take it anymore\u2014after you&#8217;ve lived\u00a0out the blissful in-between, squeezed it for every last drop, and now you must GTFO before you pull your hair out or fall in love or something like that.

Think about it\u2014there are\u00a0multiple ways of protection for almost anything. Birth control: condoms, pills, shots, patches, and more. Burglary: house alarm, sensor light, surveillance, Dad\u2019s shotgun. UV rays: sunscreen (spray or lotion), wear more clothes, sit in the shade.</p>\n<p>And then we come to our hearts, our feelings: never get in too deep, run away from anything real, and never look back OR\u2026oh wait, nope, that\u2019s it. That\u2019s the only way to ensure a pain-free experience.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s 2012. I have options for every single decision I make, every day. Except this.

That feeling you get waiting in a gate, when you look around and see the complete and utter clusterfuck of people milling and sitting and iPhoning. You feel like they\u2019re all so important, like they must all be so important to someone out there. Why else would they be flying, right? From the strictly business woman attached to her Blackberry and diet coke to the teenager picking at his braces. You\u2019re surrounded by complete strangers who are probably nothing like you and yet\u2014they\u2019re sitting in the same shitty pleather chairs, or walking on the same shitty carpet, or staring out the same huge window. They\u2019re all waiting on the same thing you are\u2014a huge metal bird to take them away from this place to somewhere new. It doesn\u2019t mean excitement\u2014I\u2019m sure as hell never flying to Paris or anything. But still. They\u2019re getting the hell out of DFW and landing somewhere else entirely (even if it is just Houston). Maybe it\u2019s just for the weekend. Shit, maybe it\u2019s just for the day. But still. They\u2019re there with their neck pillows and briefcases and carry-ons and they heard \u201cPlease have your ID\u2019s and boarding passes out and ready!\u201d just as many times as you did. And it\u2019s just fascinating. Of course, other people think I\u2019m a little crazy. You might be one of those people. But think about it. Just really stop and think about it.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the best place to people-watch. Great yellow purse. Hideous red dress. What is he thinking with that toupee? Is she serious with that green lipstick? Oh. My. God. Now that is a beautiful man. Oh, and three beautiful children. Dammit.</p>\n<p>The easiest place to have something in common with someone. \u201cOh, your flight to Austin was delayed? Yeah, same with mine to Phoenix. Why do they never seem to have their shit together here?\u201d</p>\n<p>The best place to eavesdrop. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t believe her. I\u2019m disgusted,\u201d the woman next to me whispered. Did she know she was still very audible? \u201cNot only did she admit to the cellophane thing, but when she brought the peanut butter out, she had the chocolate syrup too! Sick freak. That\u2019s the last time I find a roommate on Craigslist.\u201d</p>\n<p>The best place to completely be yourself without giving a shit what anyone thinks. After all, they\u2019re about to hop on a plane and be thousands of miles away from you. I\u2019ve literally sat and sobbed for hours waiting for a flight to LaGuardia. No one judged me, no one really even gave me a second look. I appreciate the level everyone is on in airports. There\u2019s a \u201cDo whatever the fuck you want as long as you\u2019re not smuggling bombs\u201d unwritten rule that I, and millions of others, I\u2019m sure, take full advantage of. I\u2019ve seen a chick shave her legs in a tiny bathroom sink. I\u2019ve seen a man sit in the food court, take off his suit jacket, and start preparing his drag outfit, presumably to fit the needs of his next destination. It\u2019s brilliant!</p>\n<p>And that doesn\u2019t even scratch the surface\u2014I haven\u2019t even mentioned the part where you actually board the plane. That\u2019s where the real fun begins. Sure, I\u2019ve had boring flights. Flights where I don\u2019t sit next to anyone, flights I sleep through, flights everyone but me sleeps through. But more often than not, I walk away with a great story about the person grazing elbows with me.</p>\n<p>So one day, I decided to start recording. It was just a silly thing at first, like a \u201cfunny quotes\u201d page. Then it turned into more of a journal. Then I started blogging. And then I got the phone call. Did I want to write a book?</p>\n<p>I had written a few \u201cserious\u201d posts, you know, the sort of posts that actually used a bit of my Journalism degree. One was about a 65-year-old man flying to meet his old high school sweetheart after they reconnected on Facebook. Another was about a 12-year-old girl who gave me two hours of an incessant rant about flying across the country every other holiday now that her parents were divorced. But most of my blogs were ridiculous; only meant to leave a reader rolling on the ground, pitying me for sitting next to such a catastrophe of a person. One in particular was about my eight-hour flight to Honolulu for my sister\u2019s destination wedding (unless you\u2019re loaded and therefore going to pay, please don\u2019t do this to your friends and family) in which I sat in between two overweight men, both drinking mai tais like they were shots of water.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em>&#8230;tbc <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)</span></em></p>\n", "post_id": 287, "location": false, "date": "04-11-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["bucket list", "oahu", "hawaii", "island"], "text": "<p><strong>A LOT more to cross off, and even more to add.

All the dreams were different, but one thing always stayed the same\u2014she would never cut her feet. She\u2019d run and run and run, through all the rooms, over all the bottles, and her legs would just bounce off of the colored glass gracefully. Her toes were unscathed, her heels smooth and soft, her arches still white frowns against the floor.</p>\n<p>The way she felt in the dream was the way she felt when she was dancing hula. The sway of her hips and wave-like motions of her arms reminded her of the way she looked in the dreams\u2014so much like her mother. Or at least like the pictures she had seen. There was one in the living room with writing scrawled all over her mother\u2019s body; the only piece not touching the faded black marker was her eyes. \u201cTanu,\u201d it said, and then a fancy scribbling of Hawaiian words that Kapiolani pretended to know, \u201c-Kainoa.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kapiolani would make up thousands of sentences that her mother could be writing to her father all over the pink bikini and brown skin. \u201cI love you\u201d or \u201cI miss you\u201d or \u201cI want to have a beautiful daughter with you\u201d or, her favorite, \u201cI will never leave you, I will always return.\u201d She never asked her dad what the message really said because she didn\u2019t want to know. She would see her father staring at it sometimes though, and she\u2019d want more than ever to leave the hall, run up to him, place her hand on his unshaven cheek, and ask the millions of questions she\u2019d built up over the years. What was she like? Do I look like her? What did her voice sound like? What did she smell like? Could she cook? Could she hula? And what, please, what does the photograph say?</p>\n<p>But then she\u2019d see him take another swig of his drink or hear him curse something at the television and Kapiolani would shrink away, back into the hall, back into her room, away from the bottles and into the same dream.</p>\n<p>Tonight, she fell asleep with her feet where her head usually lies. She does that sometimes when sleep seems farther away than the mainland. Her dad had those friends over again and they were laughing beer-filled laughs and coughing up smoke and spit. She could never sleep when they were over, clinking ice and eating her lunch that she\u2019d packed and hidden in the back of the fridge.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere dat pretty daughtah, eh, Tanu?\u201d Grunts and snorts and more glass hitting glass would follow and Kapiolani would lock her door. She learned a long time ago to do that. She never forgot.</p>\n<p>A taped-together photo of her mother rested gingerly below her pillow. It had been rescued from the trash after Tanu\u00a0had gone on a ripping rampage one night. He never touched the framed one in the living room, but this one was Kapiolani\u2019s second favorite. It used to be under a magnet on the freezer. Her mother, lips red like ahi, was kissing a tiny, tiny forehead that held a tiny, tiny red like ahi headband. These two, this mother and daughter, they looked magical, Kapio thought. They looked unstoppable together. Like ancient Hawaiian royalty or something.</p>\n<p>Eventually, maybe after a short, whispered conversation with the photograph, she\u2019d fall asleep. Tonight, she waited until she heard the heavy drunken footsteps leave the house of bottles. Her mind was almost lost in the dream when, \u201cKAPIO! WHERE YOU AT?\u201d jolted her up to a sitting position. The picture fell from her chest to the floor.</p>\n<p><em>&#8230;to be finished.

I\u2019m talking full-out: dye my hair, get a piercing or tattoo, sleep with that roid-head trainer at my gym, and send in an application video to one of MTV\u2019s many shitty shows. So let\u2019s hope my flight doesn\u2019t get delayed, right? I\u2019ll be teaching conversational English to a rich family all of June, and then making my way, by bus and hostels, to Pamplona for my birthday gift to myself: Running of the Bulls.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s what I\u2019m escaping:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>100 pre-teens that are causing extreme stress, gray hair, wistful thoughts of corporal punishment, and pessimism about this nation\u2019s future.</li>\n<li>Beaches. I know, I know, I live in a beautiful place. But I\u2019m looking forward to the architecture, museums dripping in Picasso and Dali, and, of course, a good ol\u2019 bull run. I never thought the sun and sand and palm trees would get old, but I guess that\u2019s just something tourists say.</li>\n<li>Disappointments. All of them, all the different kinds, big ones, small ones, fat ones, skinny ones, slimy ones\u2026however that nobodylikesmeeverybodyhatesmeguessi\u2019llgoeatworms song goes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here\u2019s what I\u2019m hoping to find:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Myself. Hahaha, just kidding. Couldn\u2019t help it.</li>\n<li>The best summer of my life. Last summer will be hard to top (Europe, moved to Hawaii), but dammit, I\u2019m going to try.</li>\n<li>Espa\u00f1ol fluency, finally? Or at least closer to it. And this time, I won\u2019t come back to the States and stop practicing and forget everything I learned. I\u2019ll teach in Spanish everyday if I have to. The kids can just deal.</li>\n<li>Some fantastic stories. My friend suggested seducing a member of the royal family, going back to his villa, and swimming laps in his infinity pool as he occasionally feeds me grapes. I\u2019m thinking more along the lines of slumming it with a stable boy (my host family owns an equestrian center), learning some secret enchilada recipe from a cranky old woman, and somehow waking up in France after a night of too-much-tequila. Ok, fine, whichever comes first.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If I don\u2019t elope or get abducted, then I\u2019ll be back in early July, probably right when I would\u2019ve started missing teaching and beaches. But until then, GET ME THE HELL OFF OF OAHU, get me on a horse in the Andalucia region, and hand me a glass of vino. No, make it a bottle.

But not in the annoying, nothing-gets-done, \u201cisland time\u201d Hawaii fashion. More of a relax, be happy, love people, eat pan and drink vino kind of slow. I am obsessed to say the least. Don\u2019t get me wrong, people love other people in places outside of Spain\u2026but not the same way. And people eat bread and drink wine in those places too\u2026but not in the same way. People relax and people are happy\u2026well, maybe not. Not in the same way, which is the best way.</p>\n<p>People here\u2026are seriously the nicest, happiest people I\u2019ve ever encountered. The lifestyle, the culture\u2026is amazing. Taking naps and eating every few hours is simply normal because it eliminates stress. To them, there is no other way. Wake up before 8\u2014why? Wait to drink any alcohol until nighttime\u2014why? Go to the gym\u2014why not just ride horses for a bit and swim a few laps in the pool? Diet? Never. Why not just have one piece of bread with dinner instead of the usual four? Work 8-5? No way! They work the hours that they\u2019ll be most productive\u2014which also means they take a large break in the middle of the day. So 9-2 and 5-8, roughly. Or whatever they feel like that day.<a href=\"http://alyshakaye.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/110.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-329\" title=\"horseback riding through their olive fields\" src=\"https://alyshakaye.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/110.jpg?w=223&#038;h=300\" alt=\"\"   /></a></p>\n<p>Everyone kisses, which made me uncomfortable at first. In Hawaii, it\u2019s easy to handle because only some people do it and it\u2019s always on one cheek, usually not even touching the lips to the cheek anyway. And in Texas, it\u2019s only with Hispanic close friends or family. But here\u2014EVERYONE, and I mean everyone, kisses you (as in full mouth contact) on both cheeks. \u201cEs Ali-Cha,\u201d (we\u2019re still working on how to say my name), \u201cEs Americana!\u201d is said to the grocery store cashier, the maid, the gardener, the doctor, and every other random acquaintance, friend, family member, or passerby that we\u2019ve come across. This is followed with a huge smile, a hug, and two giant kisses. After only a few days, I\u2019ve gone from uncomfortable to loving it\u2014especially when there are so many attractive men that seem to know my host family\u2026 The point is, they\u2019re overflowing in a way that Americans don\u2019t understand.</p>\n<p>In the States, when we decide NOT to eat or drink, it\u2019s because a) we want to save money, b) we don\u2019t want to get fat, c) we don\u2019t want to get drunk, or d) we don\u2019t want to be sleepy. In Spain, saving money is not a priority, \u201cfat\u201d means extremely obese (everything else is curvy and sexy), getting drunk is never a bad thing, and if you\u2019re sleepy\u2014nap! There is never a good reason not to have one more beer or one more bite of paella. Trust me, I tried. They are very convincing. Oh, red wine is good for me? You\u2019re right, I\u2019ve heard that, sure I\u2019ll take my fourth glass. Oh, it\u2019s tradition to have rum at the end of the night? Well, I don\u2019t want to break tradition. Oh, this restaurant serves the best ice cream in town? Ok, I guess I have to order dessert then. And so on.</p>\n<p>We are obsessed with working, becoming rich, famous, or remembered. We are obsessed with exercising, dieting, looking better than everyone else, and doing whatever it takes to stay young. We are obsessed with the material. We are obsessed with ourselves, really. In Spain, the word <em>beauty</em> is understood and used in its intended format. Generosity is everywhere, compliments are constantly oozing out of every mouth, affection and appreciation are never concealed but rather lavished. I haven\u2019t seen a single argument. Not even a frown, come to think of it. If you love someone, you tell them, immediately, in that moment, even if it\u2019s every two minutes. If you want to touch them, you do. In fact, most people don\u2019t stop touching. And yet, somehow, they are not \u201cshowy\u201d in the way that most Americans are. For example, my host family is filthy rich but they all wear the traditional plain gold wedding bands, no diamond. People work for them, but not beneath them. They are not \u201ctoo good\u201d for anything or anyone. They are open books\u2014what do you want to know? Sharing, divulging, honesty, having no shame\u2014these are all part of love\u2014and they love everyone.</p>\n<p>Americans hide everything\u2014every emotion, every thought, every little detail that could possibly, one day, maybe be embarrassing or awkward or expose any part of our true selves.

The scenic voyage became an instant attraction, but because of disrepair, the trail was closed to the public in 1987. The city of Honolulu spent $875,000 repairing the stairs, predicting a safe trail ready to open in 2002. However, when repairs were complete, the city was hesitant about the planned opening. Residents of the neighboring property complained about the visitors and <a href=\"http://archives.starbulletin.com/2003/08/18/news/story2.html\">fought the reopening</a>. During this time, hikers ignored the no-trespassing signs and the city eventually employed security guards to stand at the base of the stairs and prohibit entrance.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alyshakaye.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/034.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-342\" title=\"Are we there yet?\" src=\"https://alyshakaye.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/034.jpg?w=300&#038;h=224\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"224\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2007/Aug/02/ln/hawaii708020331.html\">Five years ago</a>, the city of Honolulu was <em>still</em> deciding the fate of the landmark. Should they reopen the famed hike to the public? Or keep it off-limits? Director of City Services at the time, Jeff Coelho, said, &#8220;The complexity of issues include everything from liability and risk to access and maintenance.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Nothing has changed since that time; the city continues to pay for security and countless locals and tourists continue to show up in the middle of the night to avoid the guard and conquer Stairway to Heaven. The hike shows up on almost every \u201c<a href=\"http://www.to-hawaii.com/oahu/attractions/stairwaytoheaven.php\">what to do in Hawaii</a>\u201d list and \u201c<a href=\"http://www.virtualtourist.com/travel/North_America/United_States_of_America/Hawaii_State_of/Oahu/Off_the_Beaten_Path-Oahu-Haiku_Stairway-BR-1.html\">virtual tourist</a>\u201d discussion I\u2019ve seen, including popular <a href=\"http://sgholiday.com/calendar/the-stairway-to-heaven/\">travel sites</a>, all of course stating that they are not condoning trespassing.</p>\n<p>After I moved to Oahu, I heard rumors very early about people dying and being injured while climbing Stairway, and that\u2019s why it was officially deemed forbidden. However, after vicious Googling, I cannot find any information on a death or injury. It\u2019s clear that the illicit nature of the trek has created many tales\u2014some true, some false. It is certainly dangerous though, and I was not going to take any chances! After all, you have to show up in the middle of the night, break into a gate, sneak quietly through the woods to the stairs, and climb up the 3,922 steps in complete darkness. One misstep or clumsy moment can literally mean falling down an entire mountain. I\u2019d much rather spend my Saturday sleeping in and then soaking up some rays on the North Shore. Alas, my adventurous itch won the battle. I had to know what all the hype was about; I had to determine for myself whether this attraction should be banned to the public or not.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alyshakaye.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/047.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-343\" title=\"proof.\" src=\"https://alyshakaye.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/047.jpg?w=223&#038;h=300\" alt=\"\"   /></a></p>\n<p>So at 2 AM, my friend Peter and I started our journey by making our way to the Windward Coast Kailua area, on empty Interstate H3. We followed a few Yelp directions very closely, parked in the nearby neighborhood, and tiptoed to the fence that warns trespassers. Our extreme paranoia kicked in when a red laser light appeared on the fence. It took our tired and nervous minds a few minutes to realize that a man was having a good laugh on his lanai behind us. We breathed sighs of relief, waved, and continued on. This part was sketchier than the actual stairs, in my opinion. You follow a winding path, taking a couple turns at forks, and eventually trekking through the eerie forest. Finally, after being a little startled by a group of fellow explorers, we reach the bottom of the stairs. It\u2019s time to begin the steep (and seemingly treacherous) climb. The cool Hawaii night air and ocean breeze do nothing for us here; we are sweating within seconds, light jackets tied to our backpacks and flashlights steady on the steps in front of us.</p>\n<p>Looking down is quite terrifying. H3 winds beneath us and random cars, seeing our flashlights, honk at us as if to say, \u201cKeep on going!\u201d However, we can\u2019t see any of the mountain itself. It\u2019s far too dark to see the work we\u2019re actually doing. I stop often, until we are finally at the first landing, after what seems like hours. We take a break to eat an apple and I secretly want to curl up and nap. The air is getting cooler as we ascend and soon I realize that the steps themselves are not difficult. They are quite small, evenly spaced, and there is helpful railing the entire way up. I feel quite safe, actually. The tough part is the distance. We climb for hours, each step tricking us into thinking we\u2019re closer to the last landing, but the darkness and the shape of the mountain make it impossible to tell. We can only guess. And finally, a group of people, huddled together with blankets and food, congratulate us. \u201cOnly this last stretch,\u201d they say, pointing. Nope, we\u2019re not there yet. They\u2019re on the lower landing to pass time until sunrise, because the top is obviously the coldest and wettest, deep in the clouds.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alyshakaye.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/036.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-345\" title=\"check out that view\" src=\"https://alyshakaye.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/036.jpg?w=300&#038;h=224\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"224\" /></a></p>\n<p>We obey the pointing and haggardly head up the last, short (for once) flight of stairs. We\u2019ve made it, we\u2019ve conquered Stairway to Heaven. Oh wait, we still have to go all the way\u2026back\u2026down. Unfortunately, we couldn\u2019t see the sun rise since it was a particularly cloudy morning, so we carved our initials in the muddy shack and started descending as lightness began revealing what we\u2019d accomplished. The misty clouds near the top dampen our hair and skin and I realize that the hike definitely has a fitting title. Made it to Heaven before I even died, oh man will my mother be proud.</p>\n<p>Trekking down the stairs is less difficult physically but more difficult because it feels less stable. The railing is slippery and now, you can see where exactly you\u2019d be falling, which is a little startling. Our seven hour process is finally over as we see the guard standing by his truck at the bottom, casually talking and joking with other hikers. We escape without even a warning. There have been people who were not so lucky, however. If you arrive while the guard is there, you can receive a citation. Also, some people have not been respectful of the neighboring residents, which has caused a lot of <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-08-22-Stairway_N.htm\">tension</a>. These residents have complained of noise, trash, and limitation of neighborhood parking. We made sure to park on an open street, we were extremely quiet, very careful with trash, and of course, we were cautious with the hike itself! If the public follows these simple rules that we did, I do not see why the legendary expedition should be banned. Stairway to Heaven is hands down the best way to take in the magnificent ocean, mountains, beaches, clouds, and other surroundings. It is an absolutely perfect way to fully appreciate and experience (both physically and mentally) the beauty and power of the island.</p>\n<p>As of today, the city has no plans to reopen the beloved hike.</p>\n<p>Our journey ended with the only sane thing to do after a vicious workout: pancakes, French toast, and hashbrowns at local favorite, <a href=\"http://www.cinnamonsrestaurant.com/\">Cinammon\u2019s Restaurant</a>. Hawaii, you never seem to disappoint.</p>\n<p>Maybe if the city lifts the ban, I\u2019ll conquer Stairway like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoTX-uG52Os&amp;feature=player_embedded\">this</a> next time.</p>\n", "post_id": 341, "location": false, "date": "07-26-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["north shore", "hanauma bay", "tourist", "island", "giovanni's shrimp truck", "hawaii", "diamond head", "vacation", "matsumoto's shaved ice", "haleiwa", "turtle beach", "oahu"], "text": "<p style=\"text-align:center;\">5 Oahu Tourist Spots that are Worth a Visit</p>\n<p>Living in Hawaii has its ups and downs, just like any other area. One major con? The tourists. They crowd beaches, cause traffic, and definitely overdo the floral print. Honeymooners are easy to spot and hard to avoid during peak season. These bright-eyed people snapping photos of every plant and sign flock to a few standard \u201ctourist spots\u201d on Oahu and I have to admit, I completely understand why. These are the spots that locals would love to stay away from, but most can\u2019t\u2014they\u2019re just too beautiful or amazing or fun or all of the above.</p>\n<p>When friends or family or strangers on the plane visit Hawaii, I always recommend hitting up the lesser-known locations on the island. The beaches\u00a0 are less crowded and more beautiful, the restaurants are less expensive and more authentic, and the bars are filled with great people and great drinks instead of coconut bras and grass skirts. However, these five major tourist spots are irresistible\u2014for anyone! My friends and I, and other locals as well, gladly surf through waves of sunburnt travelers for another experience at one of these attractions.</p>\n<p>Turtle Beach: One of the first stops along North Shore, <a href=\"http://www.turtles.org/laniakea.htm\">Laniakea Beach</a> is extremely unique because multiple Hawaiian green turtles can usually be seen casually basking on the shore or swimming in the calm waves. The huge turtles, or honu, aren\u2019t shy at all here. However, this became a problem when some people didn\u2019t treat the creatures with respect, causing a group to band together to protect the turtles all day, every day. The <a href=\"http://www.turtles.org/alohadescription.htm\">Honu Guardians</a> place red rope around the turtles so that people won\u2019t disturb them. They also know everything about the honu, and happily dole out interesting facts and pamphlets to visitors. I was blown away to learn that the green turtles swim 500 miles to lay their eggs on another island\u2014and then the newborns find their way to Laniakea Beach and the process starts all over. It\u2019s an amazing spot on Oahu that offers an incredible up-close interaction with an animal that is absolutely fascinating.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alyshakaye.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/524102_475404975805170_218197616_n-001.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image\" src=\"https://alyshakaye.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/524102_475404975805170_218197616_n-001.jpg?w=630\" alt=\"Image\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.aloha-hawaii.com/oahu/diamond-head/\">Diamond Head</a>: To call Diamond Head a hike is a bit of a stretch.

But that\u2019s one reason why so many people love it\u2014it\u2019s easy and the view is an exceptional pay-off for the little amount of physical exertion applied. The entire path is paved, some of which consists of actual staircases. You\u2019ll definitely break a sweat, but more so because of the sun beating down upon you. The breathtaking view is hidden until you reach the very top (which only takes about 45 minutes at a normal pace). It\u2019s been bustling with all kinds of people every time I\u2019ve been, but it\u2019s worth it\u2014nice work out, fantastic weather, and a gorgeous view of downtown Honolulu wrapping around the ocean.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alyshakaye.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/028.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image\" src=\"https://alyshakaye.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/028.jpg?w=630\" alt=\"Image\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.giovannisshrimptruck.com/\">Giovanni\u2019s Shrimp Truck</a>: You haven\u2019t had shrimp until you\u2019ve had this $13 plate of pure heaven.

It\u2019s hard to avoid any parts of the island, honestly, because it is just as beautiful as the postcards. I still say that you\u2019ll have a much better trip if you experience the lesser-known spots, like <a href=\"http://untappedcities.com/2012/07/13/surviving-the-stairway-to-heaven-in-oahu-hawaii/\">Stairway to Heaven</a>, but these five sites have to be crossed off of your list as well.</p>\n", "post_id": 350, "location": false, "date": "08-04-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["dating", "honesty", "love life"], "text": "<p>So I\u2019ve mentioned this before\u2014Americans aren\u2019t the most forthcoming people. But that\u2019s a stereotype, right? That\u2019s not every single American out there. It\u2019s not some golden rule that we have to follow. But for some reason, most of us simply do.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t like this and I propose a ban. Or rather, a promotion of honesty. What would the world be like if everyone just told the truth? About how they were feeling, what they were doing, thinking\u2026it\u2019s a crazy concept, I\u2019m aware. But I can\u2019t help but wonder lately.</p>\n<p>A friend recently told me that when he starts hanging out with a girl, and recognizes genuine, general interest, he lays everything on the table. He halts and throws out an open, but out of the blue question: \u201cDo you like me?\u201d He said that he likes to know \u201chow to frame a person\u201d in his mind. No games, no pretending, just up front yes or no and move on from there.</p>\n<p>This kind of struck me, and I wondered if he\u2019d ever ask me the same thing. After all, we\u2019d been hanging out a lot\u2026I\u2019d shown genuine, general interest. But he never did. And then I started to magically want to be the honest one\u2014I somehow became the one dying to ask that question. But I never did.</p>\n<p>And why not? Because people aren\u2019t honest. We don\u2019t like others to know that we care about them, we\u2019re too scared that they won\u2019t give a shit about us and break our hearts. And many times, this is the case\u2014they won\u2019t feel the same way. But at least you\u2019d know, right? You wouldn\u2019t have that eternal hope that sticks to your ribs like oatmeal and constantly soothes you with a, \u201cI\u2019m sure deep down, they do care about you\u2026\u201d Unhealthy bullshit that we all write off as normal behavior.</p>\n<p>Why is it normal to keep secrets? Ok, fine, keep some dark, heavy crap locked away, sure. No one wants or needs to know about your alcoholic mother or your lesbian phase. But when it comes to something as simple as your feelings for someone else\u2014well that\u2019s the problem right there, that word, simple. We\u2019ve molded this should-be-simple act into something insane and complex when it really shouldn\u2019t be.</p>\n<p>So I\u2019ve decided. I\u2019m going to start this \u201cpromotion of honesty,\u201d I\u2019m going to kick it off. I mean, I kind of have to, since I\u2019m the one trying to make this a new trend, right? Step 1: Tell this guy how I feel. I mean, I already know the worst that could happen\u2014rejection. Been there, done that. We\u2019ll still be friends, he\u2019s a great guy. It\u2019ll sting for a day or two and then it\u2019ll all just be a memory. And the best part is, if he doesn\u2019t feel the same, I\u2019ll at least know how exactly he feels\u2014which I never would have known otherwise. I would\u2019ve been hoping and dreaming for a\u00a0 year, assuming and inferring and analyzing his every word, thought, and feeling. Lame. So this is a win-win really.</p>\n<p>Fast forward to one week after I wrote that previous paragraph: I still haven\u2019t done it.</p>\n<p>So maybe I should go back to, \u201cIf it\u2019s meant to happen, it\u2019ll happen\u201d kind of thing. Why force honesty on people? If he felt the same, he probably would\u2019ve been honest about it already. Maybe he is being honest by not saying anything. Maybe honesty is overrated.</p>\n<p>I think I\u2019ve officially decided that I either a) like the American way of games and secrets or b) I\u2019ve been too conditioned to escape it. No matter how much I complain about it and say that I wish people were different, the truth is, I\u2019m just as guilty as everyone else. \u00a0I\u2019d rather keep it inside until it fades away.

Can\u2019t take credit for this awesomeness. But I did want to reblog and add my own comments. I need to find someone who is willing to do some of this crazy nonsense.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Go on a search for as many good climbing trees as possible, climb as high as you both can in all of them, compile photo evidence.</strong></p>\n<p>Ok so this one, not so interested. Simply because I am a terrible tree-climber. Ever since I was little really (which is when you\u2019re supposed to be into this kind of thing and good at it too) I\u2019ve looked at trees and thought, \u201cYeah, fuck that.\u201d I\u2019d rather sit underneath them. Or eat whatever fruit they provide. Or ignore them all together.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Go to a major chain bookstore and leave notes to future readers in copies of your favorite books.</strong></p>\n<p>This one is BADASS. Why haven\u2019t I done this already, on my own?? English major, nerd status, need to do this asap. Maybe it seems creepy if you slip notes into books, by yourself. When you have an accomplice in something like this, it automatically becomes poetic and cute. Here\u2019s the question though: what do you write in the notes? I mean, they\u2019re your favorite books so I guess you\u2019re like, congratulating the buyer? Or building up their anticipation? \u201cI hope you love these words as much as I did and do. \u2013Just another reader\u201d Cheesy? Don\u2019t care.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Have her dress up as a ghost and you dress up us pacman. Walk around downtown holding hands, and whenever anyone sees you two, pretend to be embarrassed, and run off screaming \u201cwocka wocka wocka.\u201d</strong></p>\n<p>I\u2019d rather dress up as Ms. Pacman, but this is pretty sweet. And hilarious. Maybe for Halloween? Any other day might be a little strange. I also don\u2019t want him to run away from me. What would I do? Awkwardly wait for him to come back, and then start the whole charade over? That\u2019s odd.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Create photo evidence suggesting that you went on an adventure that didn\u2019t really happen.</strong></p>\n<p>Why can\u2019t we just go on the adventure? But I guess it\u2019d be cool if it was an unattainable adventure. Maybe involving dinosaurs?</p>\n<p><strong>5. Dress up as superheroes and stop at least one petty crime i.e. jaywalking, littering\u2026</strong></p>\n<p>As long as people don\u2019t get pissed at us and kick our ass or something. Because I can kind of see that happening. \u201cHalt! Pick up that cigarette butt! You there!\u201d *Stab* Death.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Build forts out of furniture and blankets and wage war with paper airplanes.</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, please. But then can we sign a peace treaty, combine our forts into a kingdom, and live happily ever after? J</p>\n<p><strong>7. Try and visit as many people as you can in one night and turn as many things inside their apartment upside down as you can without them noticing.</strong></p>\n<p>Oh man, I would hate if this happened to me. But damn, it is hilarious when it happens to someone else! How do you turn some things upside down though? I need to experiment with this, I don\u2019t think I fully understand.</p>\n<p><strong>8. Go to the airport, get the cheapest, soonest departing flight to anywhere when you show up, and stay there for a weekend.</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, yes, yes. I\u2019ve always wanted to do this.</p>\n<p><strong>9. Write a piece of fiction together. Outside at a cafe. Ask strangers when you get stuck.</strong></p>\n<p>Creative writing major, so of course this got to me. But I don\u2019t imagine my significant other being a very good writer. I\u2019m just saying, most people don\u2019t like writing. Plus, I\u2019d probably hate all of their ideas. I\u2019d definitely hate all the strangers\u2019 ideas. Writing snob? Yeah.</p>\n<p><strong>10. Dress to the nines, pretend to be married, and test drive very expensive vehicles at an auto dealership.</strong></p>\n<p>Does this work? I think I\u2019d need to look older. Or he would. I still get confused for a middle school student at the school I teach at. Fail. But hey, I love dressing up.</p>\n<p><strong>11. Do the lamest tourist thing in your area that you have both secretly wanted to do forever. Have an unabashed good time!</strong></p>\n<p>I think I\u2019ve already done all the lame tourist things in Hawaii. Well, except maybe the Segway tour. I\u2019m down for that.</p>\n<p><strong>12. In the middle of the night, drive to the beach, so you arrive just as the sun is rising. Have a breakfast picnic, and then fall asleep together. Bring a sun umbrella.</strong></p>\n<p>So this is perfect for the place I live\u2026an island. Now it\u2019s going on my Hawaii Bucket List.</p>\n<p><strong>13. Drive somewhere unknown and have dinner in a city you\u2019ve never been to. With fake names.</strong></p>\n<p>Ooh la la. I want my name to be Alex. I\u2019ve always wanted that to be my name. Now for a cool last name\u2026 For some reason, everything I\u2019m thinking sounds like a stripper name. Well.</p>\n<p><strong>14. Go to a minor league baseball game under the stars. Tell each other stories about how bad you are at athletics. Randomly cheer for both teams. Eat lots of cracker jacks.</strong></p>\n<p>This is perfect since I suck at all sports and I don\u2019t understand baseball at all (what is an inning?). He would ruin this if he got too into the game though. I want a hot dog too. And a beer.</p>\n<p><strong>15. Go around the city with sidewalk chalk and draw hearts with equations inside on random things.</strong></p>\n<p>Equations? What do I look like, a math teacher? Let\u2019s cut that part out and just draw on sidewalks. And play hopscotch.</p>\n<p><strong>16. Walk around a city and perform short silent plays in front of security cameras.</strong></p>\n<p>This is kind of funny. I\u2019ve done this drunk multiple times I believe. Except I guess they weren\u2019t so much plays as they were\u2026drunken dances.</p>\n<p><strong>17. With camera and pair of boots, make photo-log of a day in the life of the invisible man.</strong></p>\n<p>This is dumb. That is all.</p>\n<p><strong>18. Walk around the city all night and find a place to eat breakfast at dawn.</strong></p>\n<p>This sounds awesome. Do we have to walk around ALL night though? I mean, there can be some sitting and laying down, right?</p>\n<p><strong>19. Go to a restaurant and convince the cook to create something completely new for you.</strong></p>\n<p>This would be legendary, even if the dish sucked. Even if the chef hated us and spit in it. I\u2019d eat every bite.</p>\n<p><strong>20. Rent a movie you\u2019ve never seen before. Set on mute and improvise dialogue.</strong></p>\n<p>I WANT TO DO THIS SO BAD. It\u2019d be better to do this to a romantic comedy, right? I don\u2019t really want to be murdered by my date, even if he\u2019s just doing the dialogue of the killer. Creepy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So there you have it. Twenty pretty random dates. If you get bored, try one out and let me know how it goes! I\u2019m definitely going to try to cross some of these off the list soon. If I find a date. Who doesn\u2019t think these are absurd.

I can\u2019t even count how many different languages I heard\u2014Spain alone has three languages technically: Spanish, Catalan, and Basque.</p>\n<p>July 6<sup>th</sup> is opening day, complete with a flour and egg toss, which I somehow managed to avoid. The fact that my clothes were still white by noon is incredible, especially since people have taken the egg and flour tradition and added a few twists. Mustard and ketchup can be seen on many once-pristine outfits, but most popular seems to be a nice sangria soak. Within minutes, people\u2019s crisp, snowy get-ups are transformed into light purple dripping things. Why anyone would want to waste wine is beyond me, but then I realize that you can buy one and a half liters of sangria or tinto de verano (red wine and soda) for a mere euro.

Souvenir tents are everywhere, along with food and drinks of course. All shops are closed, except for a few supermarkets, which must sell more in one day during San Fermin than one entire week at any other time. Restaurants and bars are open and thriving, with bathroom lines wrapping around buildings and waiters hustling to take orders.

People stare, entranced, at the sky for nearly an hour.</p>\n<p>July 7<sup>th</sup> is the first day that the bulls run through the streets. Six bulls and six steers (which act as herders) are released at 8 AM and runners shoot forward. Runners have to wake up extremely early to get in line, where the daredevils are supposed to be over 18, sober, and properly dressed. If you don\u2019t line up in time, you might be one of the people running behind the bulls, which doesn\u2019t make much sense to me, but I guess the point is to \u201crun with the bulls\u201d not \u201crun from the bulls\u201d.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alyshakaye.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/053.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-385\" title=\"or sit on top of bull statues instead?\" src=\"https://alyshakaye.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/053.jpg?w=223&#038;h=300\" alt=\"\"   /></a></p>\n<p>If you want to get seat to watch the run, you also have to wake up quite early\u2014the \u201cgood spots\u201d along the street start filling up by 6 AM. Because of this, many people simply stay up all night instead of going home. The parks are covered with trash and campers. Some people come prepared with tents or sleeping bags; others simply curl up on a bench or in the grass. Many people do this simply to save hundreds of dollars\u2014even hostels, which are usually only 20 euro a night, more than triple their prices during the festival. Not to mention, many are completely booked over a year in advance!

Many people are crouched on the fence, standing on top of garbage bins, and sitting on shoulders in order to catch a glimpse. The priceless seats, however, which everyone eyes jealously, are the small balconies above, where people leisurely stand outside, sipping coffee.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alyshakaye.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/089.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-381\" title=\"the best seats\" src=\"https://alyshakaye.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/089.jpg?w=223&#038;h=300\" alt=\"\"   /></a></p>\n<p>I find a decent spot somewhere in the middle of the route, but I still have to peer through bodies and over heads in order to see the street.

However, I see some looking behind them, purposefully slowing down, waiting for a bull to get closer because they want the thrill of running right in front of or right beside a bull. The bulls are flashes of tan hide and then it\u2019s over. The crowd goes wild for less than a minute and then the runners are out of sight, hopefully making it safely to the bullring.

Since middle school, when we read about San Fermin in Spanish class, I\u2019ve been telling people that one day, I\u2019d be traveling through Spain for my birthday. I was told that if I had been born in Pamplona on the same day, my parents would have named me Fermina\u2014a tradition. I contemplated introducing myself as such during the trip, but I realized my Spanish isn\u2019t good enough to pass as a true Fermina. Oh well, maybe next year! Until then, I\u2019ll occasionally wear my red scarf while drinking tinto de verano, reminiscing.</p>\n", "post_id": 378, "location": false, "date": "08-19-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["novel", "reincarnation", "love story", "writing", "fiction", "creative"], "text": "<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\" align=\"center\">So here&#8217;s chapter 1 of a very, very, rough, rough, never-been-edited novel that I finished last year. I started it when I was 20 years old, interning at a publishing company and grotesquely in love for the first (and only, I suppose) time. This was the result of that surge of inspiration. After I finished a few chapters, I got extremely caught up with&#8230;well, life, and didn&#8217;t touch it for a couple years. Then I found myself heartbroken and filled with a new kind of writing energy. I finished the entire novel in less than six months.\u00a0One day I&#8217;ll give it a good edit and maybe then I&#8217;ll try to publish it, but for now, I&#8217;m fine with just having it rest on my laptop, and now the first chapter being shared with you, whoever you are.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\" align=\"center\">P.S.

Some simply amused or curious, some with amazed mouths open, some with suspicious eyes, and others with pure envy. I didn\u2019t know why the hell I was still there. But I was definitely regretting telling this man that I\u2019d been here for over half a day. Most people didn\u2019t give two shits about me, everyone just ignored each other actually. But when I told this guy how long I\u2019d been in here, he started spreading the word and now, apparently I was some sort of spectacle.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey man, I said <em>why</em> are you still here?\u201d</p>\n<p>I was too busy watching Nina. She was lying in our bed, staring at the ceiling, wrapped in nothing but my holiest white undershirt. She looked beautiful, hair tangled in black mobs around her, her eyes were always more green than brown when she cried.</p>\n<p>I snapped out of it when the guy shoved me.</p>\n<p>\u201cI SAID WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU STILL HERE?\u201d His whole body was shaking. \u201cI LOVE MY WIFE TOO GODDAMNIT!\u201d He was yelling at the receptionist now. I just went back to watching Nina. She had moved her arm from over her chest to behind her pillow.</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Pierre, I understand, but there\u2019s nothing we can do. You have about two minutes now. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>His shouting turned to sobs. I could feel more eyes than before burning into me from every angle.</p>\n<p>\u201cJohanna and Fernando Alvarado!\u201d The receptionist made a check on a clipboard as a round-faced pregnant woman was led out of the side door.</p>\n<p>Nina rolled onto her stomach. I wanted to kiss the arch of her foot, the skin behind her knees. It suddenly hit me. I forced myself to turn away from my view and walked over to the balding man lying in a ball on the floor.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d I stared at the tears soaking into his mustache.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you an idiot?\u201d He glared up at me. \u201cYou get to wait.\u201d</p>\n<p>As I opened my mouth to ask <em>Wait for what?</em> the receptionist called, \u201cLuis Pierre!\u201d</p>\n<p>He stood, slowly, and brushed off his gray slacks even though they were pristine. \u201cLucky bastard,\u201d he muttered, leaving me to gaze after him in complete bewilderment. Looking back, I wonder how he knew. I guess he just figured, what else would I be doing, waiting there for so long.</p>\n<p>I stumbled over to the tiny gray-haired receptionist. Her body looked like a 12-year old, her face like an 80-year old. The name tag on her white button-up read \u201cRuth.\u201d</p>\n<p>A red-haired woman who was clutching the arm of a chubby, red-haired little boy was leaning across the desk. I caught the end of her question, \u201c\u2026any way I can find him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo ma\u2019am, I\u2019m afraid not. Yes, Mr. Floyd?\u201d Ruth looked at me expectantly. The red-haired woman drew her son in closer to her hip and whispered, \u201cHow do you do it?\u201d I looked from her to Ruth, Ruth to her.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm.\u201d I craned my neck to see if I could see Nina from here. I couldn\u2019t. I started to get anxious.</p>\n<p>\u201cMrs. Stevens, may I ask you to please sit back down? Mr. Floyd is new.\u201d Ruth sounded one tone away from robotic. Yet comforting. An understanding robot.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d The woman looked at me the way I would look at a cross between an elephant and a Chihuahua. She walked away, her son peering back to stick his tongue out at me.</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Floyd, I\u2019m sorry no one has spoken with you yet. It\u2019s a really busy time of year. Why don\u2019t you take this packet? I\u2019m guessing you need the English version?\u201d Ruth handed me a thick, stapled stack of paper and then called out, \u201cDiana Peng!\u201d I couldn\u2019t help but notice the look she tried to hide\u2014fighting to stay professional. I was apparently a freak.</p>\n<p>Everything reminded me of Nina. Our freshman year of college when I went with her to buy a pregnancy test (false alarm). Junior year when the health club was raising STD awareness and Nina forced me to get tested with her (also a negative in case you were wondering). Strange that this place obviously had a hospital-esque vibe. Definitely not my idea of heaven, which is where I thought I was when I appeared in this bright room. But there are no clouds or angels playing harps.</p>\n<p>To be honest, I didn\u2019t expect anything to happen after death. I expected them to scrape my body off the highway and wrap it up in a sheet, to later be shoved into a box, which would then be tossed into the earth. Simple really, like gardening. But somehow my body wound up here, unscathed, same clean work clothes, tie straight. I closed my eyes behind the wheel of my Jetta and when I opened them, I was standing in front of a large window watching the aforementioned scraping process. So my body\u2019s in two places? I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t feel like a \u201csoul.\u201d What is a soul? Who even says we have one? Everyone thinks they\u2019ll have the answers after they die, but apparently, you just get more questions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>One Week Ago\u2026</p>\n<p>I walked inside to the smell of spaghetti and garlic toast, one of the few meals Nina can cook well. My nose led me into the kitchen. I don\u2019t care that she cooks it every Tuesday or that the guys at the office make fun of me for bringing the leftovers every Wednesday. She\u2019s been making it for a decade and I think my body would shut down or something if I didn\u2019t have it as often.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey Booger, how was work?\u201d She smiled and stirred the noodles a bit. I noticed a spot of sauce on her bottom lip and I was quick to kiss it off.</p>\n<p>\u201cEh, it was alright. As good as the financial planning world could be.\u201d I kicked off my slacks and hung them on a kitchen chair.</p>\n<p>\u201cBabe, I wish you\u2019d do something you love. You\u2019re not an old man. It\u2019s not too late to do something crazy.\u201d She held out a piece of turkey meat on a wooden spoon. <em>Here we go again.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you so many times, we spent our entire 20s being dirt poor. I don\u2019t want to put you through that again. You teach high school English, baby, your salary won\u2019t exactly hold us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPut me through what exactly? You know that was the most fun we\u2019ve ever had. We did everything we\u2019ve ever really wanted to do. We travelled across Europe for God\u2019s sake. We lived in New York City for two years. It was bliss.\u201d I noticed another sauce spot on her shirt.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut we\u2019re gonna start trying to have a baby soon.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, are we?\u201d She grinned.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe <em>are</em> 30, Nina.\u201d That\u2019s what we\u2019d always said. That was the magic number.</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess my uterus is ready.\u201d</p>\n<p>And we microwaved the spaghetti later.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>I was back in front of my window now thinking, shouldn\u2019t this room be a lot bigger? People die every minute, yet there\u2019s only about 50 people milling around. Some reading magazines in the leather airport-looking chairs. No one looked confused, like me. What were we all waiting for? A private meet-and-greet with God/Satan? Our journey to the Golden Gate/fiery depths of Hell?</p>\n<p>Nina was finally asleep, I could relax. We\u2019d always promised that when our wrinkles sagged across the surface of every one of our limbs, we\u2019d find a way to say sayonara to the world together. We contemplated a hot air balloon ride gone wrong, popping pills, a dramatic plane crash (me being the pilot of course)\u2026so obviously, I was worried that she would try to catch up with my unexpected departure. But so far, just a lot of sleep, a lot of avoiding people, food, and showering. I was too early. I left her, her worst fear.</p>\n<p>I\u2019d sat at the window for a whole day. People were making funeral arrangements. And I had a packet in my lap that would hopefully explain why my name wasn\u2019t being called by Ruth. Maybe nobody wanted me. Maybe I was getting to return to life, like Bruce Almighty. I watched Nina breathing for a little bit longer until I felt like I was lying next to her, her breath hitting my ear softly. Then I turned over the first blank page.</p>\n<p>Hate to inform you that you\u2019re dead\u2026blah, blah, blah (skimming)\u2026Out your window you\u2019ll see\u2026blah, blah, blah (yeah, I got it)\u2026Your Exit (ah-hah! I\u2019m guessing this is the right section).</p>\n<p align=\"center\">After arrival, your name(s) will be called shortly. As your name(s) is/are called, please exit through the side door. You will have no recollection of this room until your next visit.</p>\n<p>My reading was interrupted by a really young guy, maybe 19 or 20, abruptly sitting down right next to me (everyone was pretty spread out). He smelled like weed (he smelled like high school).</p>\n<p>\u201cSo what have you figured out so far?\u201d He winked and nodded towards the packet in my lap.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm\u2026\u201d Did this kid work here or something? Is it possible to have a job after you bite the dust? Ruth obviously works here. Or is she not dead?</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a newb, right?\u201d He flicked his sandy bangs out of his eyes and grinned.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, what?\u201d Christ, I\u2019m old. And I really shouldn\u2019t even be <em>thinking</em> \u201cthe Lord\u2019s name in vain\u201d in a place like this. Never too late to be saved, right?</p>\n<p>\u201cYour first time here?\u201d He pushed his aviators down from the top of his head to the tip of his nose.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh. Yeah. That obvious?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust a little. If old Ruthie\u2019s not helpin\u2019 you out much, I\u2019m a pro around here.\u201d He laughed, a loud and short burst. So this was my savior? I was briefly reminded of the song, \u201cWhat if God was One of Us?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJude Floyd.\u201d Might as well get comfortable with the kid.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Beatles, nice dude. Jake Reynolds.\u201d He grabbed my hand, didn\u2019t quite shake it, and slumped further down into his chair. \u201cSo seriously, what do you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, we\u2019re dead for one.\u201d I tossed the packet aside as he let out another quick burst of laughter. \u201cEveryone leaves pretty quickly after getting here, anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour. Except me, which people do not seem to be pleased about.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cListen, people read the packet, they know the packet, but they still have hope. Human flaw I guess. Not your fault. They\u2019re probably just having trouble placing you.\u201d What the hell was he talking about? He leaned forward, elbows on knees. I did the same.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlacing me?\u201d</p>\n<p>He sighed. \u201cEver heard of reincarnation?\u201d <em>Oh shit.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell that\u2019s a fancy version of what really happens. This is my tenth life.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you telling me I\u2019ve been waiting here for 5 hours to get turned into a plant or a cat or something?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFive, really? Wow. And fuck no, this is a strictly human-to-human operation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo what you said about people having hope\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, you know, most people want to be with someone specific for all of their existence. But the packet says what the packet says. They\u2019re just in denial.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNina.\u201d Slowly, the pieces were coming together.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat your girl?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy wife.\u201d He saw the glint in my eye.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell look dude, I\u2019m sure you love her and all that, but you won\u2019t remember her one bit after you walk through that door. A new woman every life, it\u2019s pretty awesome. And when you come back to the waiting room, AKA when you die again, you get to chill as whatever life you liked best, AKA Jake Reynolds. Good times, man.\u201d</p>\n<p>Way too many questions were begging to be let out, but I asked the one I was most curious about. \u201cWhy do some people take longer than others?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLemme put it this way\u2014even though you won\u2019t remember your past lives while you\u2019re living another, you\u2019re still in there. In the body, I mean. It\u2019s just new skin, you know? The \u2018you\u2019 inside has to fit your surroundings I guess. But shit, I haven\u2019t been in California every time, so I guess that\u2019s just a theory.\u201d Yet another short cackle.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo this packet doesn\u2019t tell you all that stuff?\u201d I felt like I was shaking, but I wasn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>\u201cHell no. Well, I mean, yeah, but not in those words. They gotta keep it interesting I guess. It does explain how there are like, a billion of these rooms. Makes sense.\u201d His dimples remained permanently. I was starting to get annoyed.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo every time you come back here, you remember <em>all</em> of your lives?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYup. Every little detail. Kind of makes my head wanna explode sometimes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo every time, you wind up in a different waiting room or what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no. This is my home base. ISN\u2019T THAT RIGHT RUTHIE BABY?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut how do you know which life you liked best?\u201d</p>\n<p>He took off his aviators and gave me an <em>Are you serious</em> look. \u201cDude\u2026you just know. I mean, look at me. This was obviously my most attractive life. AKA the hottest girls AKA the hottest memories.\u201d</p>\n<p>I couldn\u2019t imagine having a happier life than the one I had with Nina. Unless it\u2019s a longer life with Nina.</p>\n<p>\u201cJake Reynolds!\u201d We both looked behind us at Ruth, who gave Jake an exasperated raise of her eyebrows. He just laughed more.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll see you around, buddy. Good luck, newb!\u201d He clapped me on the back and made his grand exit, blowing \u201cold Ruthie\u201d a kiss before diving, yes, literally diving through the side door.</p>\n<p>This was ridiculous. I walked over to the desk, checking on Nina first (still sleeping, on her side now).</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Floyd, did you read your packet already?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, Ruth, I\u2019d much rather talk to you. Plus, the packet doesn\u2019t explain why I\u2019ve been here 10 times longer than all these people. I just learned more from a 500-year old, yet underage, surfer than this shit.\u201d I slammed the papers onto the counter and tried to lower my heart rate. I don\u2019t usually get \u201cbothered.\u201d I\u2019m extremely placid. Nina calls me Jude the Nude sometimes because she thinks all nudists are relaxed hippies.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cBe that as it may,\u201d I\u2019d told her the first time she explained her stereotype, \u201cI hate being naked. So that just won\u2019t do as a nickname.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t hate being naked with me.\u201d She gave me the \u201cLet\u2019s be late to work\u201d look. I love that look.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ruth bit her lip and whispered, \u201cMr. Floyd, if I knew why you were still here, I would have told you hours ago. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you realize what everyone thinks, right?\u201d I softened my voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat you\u2019re waiting.\u201d She looked down.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot waiting for my named to be called.\u201d</p>\n<p>She gave up. \u201cWaiting on her.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExactly. And I\u2019ve decided, why not? Who cares what the damn packet says? So if anybody asks, yes, that is what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m waiting on my wife.\u201d</p>\n<p>I walked away, back to my window, ignoring the stares and gapes. Nina was waking up.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Four Days Ago\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cYour eyes are like the Atlantic and Pacific.\u201d Nina rubbed by eyebrows with her thumbs, as if she were trying to lay them down flat. She always did that in the mornings.</p>\n<p>\u201cOceans\u2026\u201d I muttered, still half-asleep.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, oceans. I hope our kids get them.\u201d She nuzzled into my chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cI like your eyes.\u201d I stretched.</p>\n<p>\u201cBoring, poop brown.\u201d She kissed my nipple.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell I hope they get your everything else then.\u201d I rolled on top of her, licking her shoulders, neck\u2026</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cMR. FLOYD! MR. FLOYD!\u201d Someone was tapping me with those god-awful plastic nails, <em>hard</em>. I opened my oceans and unstuck my forehead from the glass. It was just Ruth.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was having a really good dream.\u201d I squinted up at her and then glanced down at Nina. Before I fell asleep, she\u2019d been crying in the bathtub. Now she was back in bed.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes well, I\u2019m sorry. No one has ever slept in here.\u201d She put her hand on my hip and shook her head, like I was a science experiment gone wrong.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I thought heaven was supposed to rid you of hunger, thirst, all those earthly pains.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is not heaven, Mr. Floyd. And I take it you\u2019d like some lunch?\u201d</p>\n<p>My stomach growled loudly. \u201cIs there a special of the day? Holy Hamburger? Mary Meatloaf? Angel hair pasta?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cVery funny. Come with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>I looked uneasily out the window.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Ruth once again gave away with her eyes that I was like a Ripley\u2019s Believe It or Not showcase.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d I whispered to the glare of the glass.</p>\n<p>Ruth walked me behind her desk and through a door that I had never noticed. A break room?</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you dead?\u201d Might as well be blunt.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her whole body tensed, but she didn\u2019t hesitate with her answer.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo this is literally your job? What do you tell people? How did you apply, was it listed on Monster?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI tell people the truth, Mr. Floyd, that I am an administrative assistant.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, to God!\u201d I was gaping. She glanced at me with pity and then opened a fridge and pulled out a brown bag. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s your boss, right? Seriously, how did you swing this? Are you a nun?\u201d I was no longer hungry, this was way too fascinating.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook Mr. Floyd\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease call me Jude.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLook Jude, I am not a therapist, I am not a babysitter, and I am not a nun. I do not need to answer any questions, I do not even need to be feeding you. I gave you a packet, you obviously haven\u2019t read it. From now on, here\u2019s the break room, please clean up after yourself. However, I\u2019m sure you won\u2019t be with us much longer.\u201d Her voice finally sounded less robotic. She slammed the brown bag on a table and crossed her arms.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry if I upset you Ruth, but I just want to know more about this place.\u201d</p>\n<p>She sighed deeply. \u201cThis is The Waiting Room, what else is there to know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlenty. I\u2019ll start with: is this really a reincarnation factory?\u201d I peeked inside the brown bag. An apple and a tuna sandwich. I would\u2019ve preferred the Holy Hamburger.</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Floyd, I need to get back to the desk. I\u2019m sure there are at least ten names that are ready by now. Plus, my shift\u2019s almost over. Maybe you\u2019ll find Joe more helpful.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJude. And can I take this into the almighty waiting room?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, <em>Jude</em>, people will gawk.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPeople are already gawking Ruth!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMust I really bicker with you, Mr. Floyd? You must follow the rules here, understood?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not a nun?\u201d She threw her hands up and stormed back to her desk while I took about 30 seconds to scarf down the sandwich, shove the apple in my pocket, and get back to Nina.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>Two Days Ago\u2026</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cI did it.\u201d I came rushing into the living room, where Nina was grading Hamlet papers and eating Hamburger Helper.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid what, Booger?\u201d Her voice trailed off, she was deep into Red Pen World.</p>\n<p>\u201cNina, listen. I did it! I took out a small business loan today at work. We\u2019re gonna create a new town.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s amazing! What shall you build first?\u201d She kissed me long and hard before I could answer. I breathed in her perfume.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell the loan is actually enough to get started on a small movie theater and a cookie shop\u2014my two favorites.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBabe, are you serious? This is so great! Even though I\u2019d rather you start with a decent pizza shop!\u201d</p>\n<p>We had moved to one of the smallest cities in Texas\u2014it contained a Dairy Queen and a Dairy Queen parking lot. But teaching jobs were scarce and Nina jumped on the chance. Plus, Austin wasn\u2019t very far away, so I was able to find a boring bank job easily. But we were tired of driving for 30 minutes every time we wanted to go on a date. Most of the time, we just stayed in, dreaming up things we\u2019d build right around the corner if we had the time and money.</p>\n<p>We cuddled on the couch and finished off the stroganoff while I rambled on and on about starting my own business. It was all I ever wanted to do. The only question: when to quit my job.</p>\n<p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t even be helping people with their finances. I\u2019m not even good at it! Look at me, about to open my first business while simultaneously trying to impregnate my wife. I\u2019m the one that needs advice.\u201d Nina giggled and kept scratching my back.</p>\n<p>\u201cStop worrying, Honey. If you want, I\u2019ll start taking my birth control again\u2026it\u2019s only been a few days.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo! I want a mini mixture of us running around here. I want more than one. I\u2019ll just make sure my businesses succeed. Small feat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHave I ever told you that I love you more than all the eyelashes in the world?\u201d She was so random sometimes.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re never out of new ones, are you?&#8221; I brushed her bangs away from her eyes, but they soon fell back into place.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You should try it, it&#8217;s very satisfying.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Alright. I love you more than all the freckles in the world.&#8221; I&#8217;m not very original, she was the poet. But hey, I thought it was cute.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Weak.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Oh c&#8217;mon, everyone knows there&#8217;s more freckles than eyelashes in the world.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Are you kidding me? There are millions of people who don&#8217;t have one single freckle.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yeah but then there are other people covered in them.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;But it doesn&#8217;t matter because <em>everyone</em> has eyelashes.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;That is false. Besides, have you ever counted your eyelashes? Not that many.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Have you ever counted your freckles? You have way more eyelashes.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She was probably right, but I thought I was fighting a fair fight. &#8220;Are you forgetting about the ones on my butt?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;No, those are my favorite.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She smiled that smile where the creases of her mouth formed fake dimples. I loved those. She always said her body tried so hard to produce something she had always wanted. I told her one day that they weren&#8217;t that special, that in Chemistry, we learned they were actually a dominant trait. She didn&#8217;t care. She got pissed, ranting about how she <em>would</em> have a boring recessive gene.</p>\n<p>I probably would&#8217;ve come up with something better than freckles if I would have known. I would&#8217;ve done a lot of things.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cYou must be Joe.\u201d I stuck out my hand. Ruth had finally left (strange to think we\u2019d actually be friends one day) and an extremely hairy, middle-aged man had replaced her.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you must be Jude.\u201d He smiled to reveal a mouthful of braces.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why I\u2019m surprised that you already know my name.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019re creating quite the stir. But hey, who wants to live a boring life, right?\u201d He followed that one with a roar of laughter, turning the almost visible skin under his thick black hair bright pink. \u201cToo soon?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNah, I don\u2019t mind death jokes. But I promise I\u2019ll laugh next time if you help me out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you want to know?\u201d He folded his hands over his protruding belly. \u201cDebbie Tennant!\u201d A tall, beautiful black woman strutted through the ominous door in red high heels.</p>\n<p>\u201cSeriously? That easy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell you\u2019ve almost been here an entire day. I figure you\u2019re doin\u2019 just what everyone thinks you\u2019re doin\u2019. Might as well let you in on the biz if you\u2019re gonna be here awhile.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWow. Ok. Thanks.\u201d I was dumbfounded. He was nothing like Ruth.</p>\n<p>\u201cRuth was that hard on you, huh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell I guess she\u2019s just trying to do her job.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah well, she\u2019s been here since the beginning. Never seen anything like you. I think she\u2019s just worried.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow is it possible that she\u2019s been here \u2018since the beginning\u2019 if she\u2019s still alive? She told me she was alive.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell one thing I can\u2019t tell ya\u2019 is someone\u2019s personal stuff. I might as well just give you her file!\u201d Another loud roar of laughter. \u201cLa Shawn Stewart!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo are you alive too then?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou bet your ass I am. Different this time though. I\u2019m a happy man now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>Joe sighed. \u201cI stuck a rifle under my chin about ten years ago, but I was given a second chance to live a better life, do better things. Paul Foster! So I woke up in my apartment, holding my rifle and my new work schedule for this old place. Best thing that ever happened to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWow. So this is some kind of redemption for you guys?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNah, it\u2019s not like that for all of us. Like I said, I can only tell ya\u2019 what I can tell ya\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo who\u2019d you talk to? When you died\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Loud roar of laughter. \u201cRuth. She told me that I needed to \u2018get my act together\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you came here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYup. I made my decision and she handed me a nametag and a schedule.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo what if you would\u2019ve chosen to\u2026stay dead?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI woulda been sent to another life, endin\u2019 in the same way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho would ever choose <em>that</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised. Most people don\u2019t wanna wake up in the same body, in the same apartment, with the same feelin\u2019 in their gut.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm.\u201d That was a lot to take in. But I was determined to squeeze as much information out of this guy as possible. \u201cSo the billions of people on Earth, they\u2019re just the exact same billions that have been living since the beginning of time?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, some of \u2018em. You\u2019re new, obviously. That damn population rate. Keeps gettin\u2019 higher. People like baby-makin\u2019 and I don\u2019t blame \u2018em.\u201d This man laughed more than anyone I\u2019d ever met. I would\u2019ve loved meeting him while I was alive. Probably at a sports bar. But right now, I just needed answers.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo once you\u2019re\u2026created or whatever, you just keep living lives, century after century\u2026forever?\u201d I had a brief picture in my head of an old TV show I used to watch with my dad\u2014\u201cHighlander\u201d, starring Duncan MacLeod, the centuries-old, sword-fighting badass who could only be killed if you chopped his head off and took all his powers.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell it\u2019s not that simple.\u201d He made kind of a wincing face. \u201cYou could wind up anywhere. I mean, in any time. It\u2019s, uh, kind of hard to explain. The packet explains better than I can.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you saying that your lives aren\u2019t in chronological order?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExactly. I have no personal experience since I\u2019m, ya\u2019 know, in one of my lives right now. But I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve lived in plenty of places and years\u2026or maybe this was my first life, who knows.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight\u2026since you only remember when you\u2019re in this\u2026place.\u201d I rubbed my temples. College was a piece of cake compared to this \u201clesson.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re in this place because you\u2019re dead, not because you\u2019re at work. You\u2019re gettin\u2019 it!\u201d He picket at something in his braces.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen a ton of movies, Joe. But how can you physically, actually, <em>be reborn</em> in the <em>past</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHell if I know, buddy! That\u2019s just how it works I guess. The packet says it\u2019s a \u2018continuous cycle\u2019.\u201d The thought of being born before 1980 was not appealing to me. At all. Nina would be happy though. She loved the fashion and the language and the simplicity of the past.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou gonna be here awhile, Joe?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYesiree. A full eight hour shift.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nina was still in bed. Her mom was sitting on the edge.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe were trying to have a baby Mom.\u201d Now they were both crying. I felt the need to look away, but I couldn\u2019t. It was like our infamous need to stare at a car crash. But I caused this crash.</p>\n<p>I watched Rose stroke Nina\u2019s head, brush her hair away from her face, rub her back\u2026and I felt my eyes drooping.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Yesterday\u2026</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We finally rolled out of bed and said goodbye. I only pecked her lips, thinking how late I already was for work. But she understood. She didn\u2019t like it when I messed up her vanilla lip gloss anyway.</p>\n<p>What 30-year-old still wears vanilla lip gloss? She\u2019d punch me and say \u201cThis 30-year-old.\u201d</p>\n<p>She waved out of the doorframe as I sped down the highway and the next time I\u2019d see her wouldn\u2019t be in fake dimples and sticky kisses. I only ever saw a work email, opened on my phone, and then an 18-wheeler for a quick second, as I was sliding into it. And then darkness. And then the bright waiting room. And then her again, through a window, untouchable.</p>\n<p>They said she didn\u2019t need to identify the body, that they used my teeth or something. How CSI right? All they really mean is that the body\u2019s too messed up and they don\u2019t want her going psycho. As if seeing me would\u2019ve made it harder than it already was. As if she already didn\u2019t have a picture in her head of what I looked like. She had seen blood, it was hard to miss. So what would\u2019ve been the difference? But I guess I\u2019m just saying that. I\u2019m glad they didn\u2019t let her see me. She probably <em>would</em> have gone psycho. Trying to piece me back together or something. She didn\u2019t even believe them when they said I was dead.</p>\n<p>I kept on thinking about time and how it all matters. The clich\u00e9, <em>what if I would have been with her for five more minutes? </em>Then I would\u2019ve been on the highway five minutes later, and then there\u2019d be no wreck. Or I\u2019d be stuck in traffic because of a wreck killing somebody else\u2019s husband. But seriously, what if I would\u2019ve kissed her goodbye one more time? A long, 30-second kiss. Taking off all of her Bath and Body Works \u201cCake Icing.\u201d Would that have made a difference?</p>\n<p>Someone had taken my shoes and placed them neatly by a police car. How strange.</p>\n<p>\u201cMa\u2019am, I think it\u2019s time you head home,\u201d some officer gripped her shoulder. I glared at his wedding ring creasing her shirt.</p>\n<p>She was hugging the black dress shoes.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you hear me, ma\u2019am?\u201d</p>\n<p>She glanced at the 52 card pickup of \u201cJessie the Jetta.\u201d She always had to name my cars. And then she headed home to curl up in bed, surrounded by everything we had taken so long to build together.</p>\n<p>A year and a half later, she took the shoes off her desk and put them in a box in our closet with all of our pictures. I forgot to take the sticker off the left one, she did that for me. It was dirty and faded, $44.99 Size 10.5. Later, she took the sticker out of the trash and smoothed it back on the bottom of the heel. One of the corners refused to stick, curling up, no matter how many times she laid it flat. She kissed it over and over for hours, tears soaking into every inch of leather.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "post_id": 389, "location": false, "date": "09-10-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["people from your past", "life", "family", "memories", "love life", "friendship"], "text": "<p>It\u2019s funny how there are pieces of people that stay with you forever, even if the actual people don\u2019t. You can go years without seeing someone, or even talking to them, but all it takes is a smell or a taste or a song\u2014and they\u2019re figuratively next to you, live, in color, in the flesh, dimples flashing.</p>\n<p>Even more bizarre is how the current people who occupy your time, your present, can literally be next to you and yet not affect you at all. How can there be some people who don\u2019t leave behind any pieces whatsoever? Were they not supposed to be in your life at all? Or is everyone meant to have these meaningless, vanilla time-fillers? And in that case, is everyone also meant to be someone else\u2019s meaningless, vanilla time-filler? I guess it\u2019s acceptable for the acquaintances that you see every so often, the friends of friends, the distant relatives, the people you ask the same questions to and vice versa every single time: \u201cHow are you? How\u2019s teaching? How\u2019s the love life, eh?\u201d</p>\n<p>But I hope to God that I never leave someone\u2014someone of more importance than an acquaintance\u2014mark-less, 100% unscathed by my presence in any way, good or bad. How tragic and boring, to never be thought of at all, ever, even if it\u2019s just once in 20 years, when an old friend makes a disaster of mashed potatoes, walks by a person wearing a certain perfume, or sees someone with that same awful haircut that you had that one year&#8230;</p>\n<p>I guess it\u2019s more depressing to think of this happening with someone you\u2019ve dated. And I can definitely think of people who I\u2019ve dated and \u201cdated\u201d who won\u2019t ever be crossing my mind, unless I\u2019m writing about people who never cross my mind. Sucks to be you. But is it their fault, or mine? I of course want to say that it\u2019s theirs\u2014they should have been more interesting, funny, smart, gentlemanly, etc. They should have stuck around longer. They should have been more memorable, right? Or maybe I just didn\u2019t give them a chance to be those things. Or maybe they were those things, and I didn\u2019t notice or want to notice or care to notice.</p>\n<p>We see what we want to see, right? I mean, if you want to hate someone, you connect them in your mind with petty or horrible shit. Bad memories, fighting, yelling, crying, lying. I had plenty of that with a certain ex, but instead, I think of him every single time I eat a cupcake, pick out a Halloween costume, go bowling, see a pair of incredibly blue eyes, or drink Dr. Pepper.</p>\n<p>I think of my best friend Johanna every single time I hear any Ben Folds or Jack\u2019s Mannequin, any time someone references Aggies, debate, Nicaragua, or little brothers, and any time I see someone with a huge, happy smile.</p>\n<p>I think of my mom every time I eat spaghetti, every time people talk about role models or single-parent-stronger-than-steel-support-systems, and every time I see blue eyeshadow.</p>\n<p>I think of my dad every time I see a magic trick, a gun, or a Santa, every time people talk about Texans, every time I eat a steak, and every time I really need a hug.</p>\n<p>Every TV show or movie I watch is connected to someone. Every band, every song, every meal I cook, every outfit I wear, every restaurant I go to\u2026 The mind is a crazy gadget. Every time I drink tea\u2014Grandma. Every time I smell a pipe\u2014Papa. Every time I eat hummus\u2014my roommate Leslie. There\u2019s not much that my brain doesn\u2019t associate to someone I care about.</p>\n<p>I guess the real question I have is: when you reach a certain number of things that remind you of a specific person, does that mean that they should still be in your life? I mean, once you get to a certain point, and you realize that the smallest, most random things remind you of this person from your past, are you supposed to just keep living without them? Are you supposed to wait for it to completely go away? What if it never does? How often is \u201ctoo\u201d often for someone to pass through your mind? And for that matter, when you find yourself never thinking of a person, is that reasonable cause to drop them entirely? If you only think of that person when you\u2019re in their presence, is that acceptable?</p>\n<p>Oops, that was more than one question.</p>\n<p>Let me try to nutshell these thoughts. I know that it\u2019s normal to have silly, sporadic moments where an image of someone plasters itself to every inch of you. It\u2019s like someone is drawing from a hat of your past and present relationships (platonic and otherwise) and then flinging the chosen photo down on your day when you least expect it. But I feel like this can\u2019t ALL be purely coincidence via memory\u2014I feel like at some point, life must just be telling you that this person is stuck to your heart for a reason. Especially when those everyday things (banana split ice cream, that one scar, that one expression) that they\u2019re, for some reason or another, \u00a0sprinkled on top of are happy, funny, loving, meaningful, or delicious.</p>\n<p>Right?</p>\n", "post_id": 391, "location": false, "date": "09-18-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["hawaii", "leaving", "moving", "oahu", "teaching", "texas"], "text": "<p>I&#8217;ve officially applied for three different school districts in the Austin area. I doubt I\u2019ll get a job offer since I currently do not have my license, masters, nor have I taken the Texas required tests (yay for being from a state that has to create its own EVERYTHING).</p>\n<p>But maybe that\u2019s ok, to stay in Hawaii a little longer? Where I have a for sure job, a for sure house\u2026ok that\u2019s all that I have for sure. And a gym membership, I have that. And lots of shit, including my car, which I don\u2019t want to even think about boxing or shipping or selling or throwing away\u2026</p>\n<p>What the hell is wrong with me?</p>\n<p>I have these moments where I want nothing more than to stay here, in the sunshine. My skin is smiling, constantly tan. I buy random fruits just because you can&#8217;t get them on the mainland. My car is filled with sand. I drive past those trees on Kam that are bursting with the yellowest of yellow flowers and I think, &#8220;Jesus there&#8217;s nowhere more beautiful.&#8221; I appreciate never being cold. I cherish the fact that I can jump in the ocean or climb a mountain at any moment if I so choose.</p>\n<p>But then I remember how far away I am from my family, from my best friend, from decent Mexican food, and from date-worthy men (at least, I\u2019m guessing they\u2019re all in Austin). I remember what it feels like in the fall, the first time you can bring the boots out from the back corner of your closet. I remember floating the river and 6th Street and The Square and Sonic Happy Hour and the baby cousin I haven&#8217;t met yet. I remember my dog, Mardi, and the deer and the quiet, country sound that is so different than the quiet sea.</p>\n<p>But then I remember the scorpions, spiders, mosquitoes, humidity, and belt-buckled rednecks who call people fags and give our entire state a bad rep.</p>\n<p>I realize that I\u2019ll be surrounded by not just good memories, but all the bad ones too. You never know who you\u2019ll see at HEB, right? The guy who completely pulverized your heart, the old friend who helped him do it, the creep who you filed sexual harassment charges against at your first real job, the boss who cared more about protecting the company\u2019s name than protecting you, the father who you might not even recognize, but you do because he looks like you.</p>\n<p>Here I\u2019m safe from those people, or those kind of people. There are no extremes here, which is of course a con as well because that means there are no greats\u2014family, friends, loves. But at least there are no extreme enemies? There are a few people who I\u2019d prefer not to see downtown, but maybe one day I will and I\u2019ll either run away or have an awkward, fake conversation. There\u2019s a guy who I kind of, sort of fell for and then he promptly exchanged his boyfriend ticket for a cleaner, larger font acquaintance ticket. There are a lot of grab-bag pals, lots of pebbles, no rocks. Hawaii\u2019s not a hideaway though, or a refuge\u2014if anything, it\u2019s a time capsule that forces you to dwell and make decisions and move on or hold on. But it also feels like a giant pause button of a rock.</p>\n<p>Anyway.</p>\n<p>I flip-flop pretty regularly. I love it here\u2014I love the keiki, I love the beach, I love that I can get authentic Thai, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, or Indian food on any part of the island. I love the aloha and the rainbows and the bright birds and I can\u2019t stand the thought of seeing the Gulf again after\u00a0I&#8217;ve\u00a0seen the blueness of these waters.</p>\n<p>But nothing beats home, brown waves and all. I forget what it\u2019s like for people to not think it\u2019s weird when I say \u201cy\u2019all\u201d or \u201cfixin\u2019 to\u201d or \u201ccoke\u201d when I mean soda. I don\u2019t like being so far away from my mom\u2019s embrace, my dad\u2019s wisdom, or my best friend\u2019s dance moves. I don\u2019t like being isolated in the middle of the Pacific, thousands of miles and dollars away from anyone or anything. I don\u2019t like that no one ever stays here. You\u2019re either here for the military, college, or the experience\u2014all transient, all temporary. Half my fellow teachers or more will be packing their bags in May. Slowly, the numbers will dwindle and, most likely, I\u2019ll have zero friends on Oahu by 2015.</p>\n<p>I miss the comfort, the familiarity. But can I move back without a job? Surely, no. I\u2019d go crazy without a teaching job, I\u2019d go crazy if I had to resort to subbing or retail or living with my parents or taking another cubicle life-sucking 9 to 5.</p>\n<p>So what to do? Besides wait. And dream about bringing everything and everyone that I love here, spreading them all over the islands. I heard this place is hard to leave. It&#8217;s true. I&#8217;d rather stay and create my own utopia. Some family on Maui, some friends on Kauai, or a new addition to the chain, a mini Texas island popping up above Oahu, holding everything I miss, just a ferry ride away.

This is what he inspired that day:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Innocence is blonde curls and a naked, sandy butt.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Running into an ocean without checking with your toe for the temperature.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Fingering your ding-a-ling for all to see.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Confidently rambling in Spanish to foreign strangers.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Innocence is loving everyone, most of all yourself.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">And your sandcastle.</p>\n<p>\u00a0I\u2019ve been thinking about Pablo lately, and that crazy, unyielding tolerance and unabashed nature that kids have. Losing our innocence is something we\u2019ve all reflected on at some point in our lives, but it\u2019s so strange being a middle school teacher, watching it happen on a daily basis. I listen to some of my students and think, oh man, why don\u2019t I have that anymore? That spark, that unafraid boldness that creates a killer essay, hilarious journal entry, or just the truest shouted out response to a question. Sometimes it stops me mid-lesson and I just stare for a second at what I once must have had myself. I want that! I miss that!</p>\n<p>Now, just to write this blog for example, I\u2019ve lazily pondered and procrastinated for a month, trying to decide which topic was worthy, waiting for inspiration. I finally decided after sitting here at Starbucks for half an hour, realizing that when I was young, by this time I would\u2019ve already written three short stories and five poems. I had spirals and diaries full of scribblings. They might have all been complete garbage, mainly about a talking dog/detective or my imaginary twin sister Ashley who had super powers, but I didn\u2019t care, I just wrote. My latest poetry notebook is only half full and I started it three years ago. My novel has been sadly waiting for a decent edit, neglected. I\u2019ve written one short story in the past year. What was once second nature is now analyzed to the point of destruction of the idea altogether. Everything we say and do nowadays seems to be sent through a filter of, \u201cIs it good enough?\u201d and \u201cHow many calories does that have?\u201d and \u201cWhat would other people think of this?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kids just don\u2019t care about most things\u2026and it\u2019s great! I love it for them, it allows them to be more themselves than they\u2019ll probably be for a long time. Once high school comes around, most people get swept up into being someone else, someone they think they should be, and it tends to not go away completely for quite a while. My students are hot messes of emotions\u2014they wear it all on their sleeves and they don\u2019t mind who sees them cry while sharing a journal, yell at their backstabbing friend in the hall, or smile the hugest smile and fist pump after getting a test back. We adults tend to hide and privatize and pretend and fake and the list goes on\u2026 I worry sometimes that this means kids are the only genuine people on the planet. They\u2019re our future but they\u2019re being taught to grow up just like us and lose their wide eyes, cash in their dreams, and harden. Somewhere along the line, becoming an adult came to mean valuing realism over creativity and stability over enthusiasm. Good credit, salary, and a solid health plan trump artistic abilities, honesty, and loyalty.</p>\n<p>Other times, I realize the benefits of growing up: the reason, logic, you know, basically all that boring stuff that kids don\u2019t give a shit about but it actually does come in handy eventually. The other day, the last bell rang, releasing my class for Thanksgiving break. Many of them were meeting in the band room for a picture, so they were all racing to the bathrooms to change. I\u2019m typing away on my computer, thinking everyone has left. Then I notice Colby. In the corner of my room, half-naked. My immediate thought was, oh, so I\u2019m probably going to get fired. If someone would have walked by, Jesus. The youngest teacher in school, alone in her room with a half-naked 12-year-old boy. Sounds like a news story I\u2019ve heard a time or two. The best part was, after I flipped out on him and told him to put his clothes on, his reaction was just a sheepish grin, shrug, and \u201cSorry Miss.\u201d Of course he\u2019s not going to think of the implications, he\u2019s simply thinking that he needs to change and all the bathrooms are full.</p>\n<p>Things used to be simple like this. Come home, have a snack, do homework, watch TV, eat dinner, go to bed. Now we live over-complicated lives with over-complicated gadgets and \u201clife tracks\u201d and lists and plans and wants and worries and hopes and fears.</p>\n<p>We know how to make smart choices now. That doesn\u2019t mean that we always choose to make them, obviously. But at least we know the difference between what we should and shouldn\u2019t do\u2026 But does this even matter, since we continue to make bad decisions? And maybe making those \u201cbad\u201d decisions should actually be seen as freeing and modes of self-expression and glimpses into the innocence we once had. There has to be some sort of balance, because innocence is genius. There has to be some way to hold onto that passion we had when we were kids, that brazen attitude that we carried around like a giant trophy. I try to capture that brash bliss every time I write, every time I eat ice cream, every time I open up to a person.</p>\n<p>We have to try to do this more, or else our world will look so bleak, boring, and robotic fifty years from now.</p>\n", "post_id": 397, "location": false, "date": "11-26-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["dad", "family", "death", "dying", "cancer", "father", "stepdad", "prostate"], "text": "<p>Cancer is that thing you hear about- on TV, movies, or from friends about friends of friends. You never think it&#8217;ll be you or YOUR parents. And if it is, you imagine it&#8217;ll just be a scare or a simple, no-brainer, caught it early type deal.</p>\n<p>My dad is my stepdad, as most people know. Although once, at a wedding, a man said, &#8220;This your daughter? I can tell, you have the same smile.&#8221; Me and dad looked at each other and grinned. If he meant we both had lips and teeth, well sure. But dad is a 60-something Santa look-alike with baby blue eyes and a Texan tattoo.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I obviously love the guy with all my heart and up until now, I kind of thought he was invincible. My parents, lovely tight-lipped haoles, thought it&#8217;d be best to wait until I was home for Christmas to tell me that Dad has prostate cancer.</p>\n<p>Big mistake. 1. I&#8217;d just spent 12 hours on a plane. 2. Of course I&#8217;m going to be pissed that the whole damn family knows except me. 3. Dad made me think he was giving me a present.</p>\n<p>Let me explain #3. Mom\u2019s usually the one who buys me gifts, unless it has to do with technology or cars in any way. This is rare, since those things are usually expensive, and this is when Dad takes over. Whenever this happens, he\u2019s like a small child. He cannot wait to give me the gift and he pesters Mom until she says, \u201cOk, fine!\u201d This is exactly how he was acting all day. I was like, hell yeah, I\u2019m about to get a new laptop or a kindle! What an extreme opposite to a gift.</p>\n<p>At that point, I was bawling, yelling, and getting away with cussing all at the same time. Total psychotic episode. That is the only time in my life that my parents haven\u2019t severely scolded me for saying \u201cfuck.\u201d</p>\n<p>I was pissed that they hadn\u2019t told me, but I was even more pissed that Dad hadn\u2019t taken action yet. He has some great points and explanations about \u201chis plan,\u201d but I don\u2019t really care. I\u2019d rather the doctors chop off the entire lower half of his body if it meant he\u2019d be alive longer. I don\u2019t care that it\u2019s his body and I don\u2019t care about the nasty side effects. However, I apparently don\u2019t get an opinion on my dad\u2019s genitals. Go figure.</p>\n<p>I realized that for them to sit me down and tell me this\u2014and for Mom to be crying while they did so\u2014this was obviously a lot more serious than Dad was letting on. They\u2019ve both had cancer scares before. Dad even had to have a kidney removed. But those times either a) really weren\u2019t that big of a deal, b) they were much better liars back then, or c) I was a na\u00efve idiot. I\u2019m going to go with a mix of all three.</p>\n<p>Dad will probably not like that I wrote all this but\u2026 the way I see it, I need to cover all bases. I don&#8217;t pray. But I admit that I very well could be wrong about this God character. I\u2019m probably not, but just in case, I need as many people out there who DO pray to pray.</p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t know my dad very well and you\u2019d like to make your prayer more personable, here are some solid facts you\u2019re welcome to use:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Dad\u2019s middle name is LeRoy. He despises it and using it to his face WILL get you a death glare.</li>\n<li>Dad loves Obama, vegetarian foods, marijuana, and Diet Coke. He wants to outlaw guns and move somewhere more his style, like L.A. He wishes he could spend more time at the beach, shopping, or volunteering in Africa with Hilary Clinton.</li>\n<li>He is the utter opposite of #2.</li>\n<li>Dad likes to seem tough, and he definitely can be. But at heart, he\u2019s a complete teddy bear who cried when I wrote him a really cheesy poem once.</li>\n<li>Fishing, poker, and television crime shows. Obsessed.</li>\n<li>He has never treated me like a \u201cstepdaughter\u201d\u2014I don\u2019t really know what that even means really. All I know is that I can\u2019t tell the difference between our relationship and the relationship all my friends have with their \u201cblood fathers.\u201d He definitely stepped up to the plate and filled a void in my life and I love him so much more for that.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>All jokes aside, I\u2019m scared shitless. I tried to make this blog lighthearted so that it wouldn\u2019t be a completely depressing read. I love hiding my emotions behind humor! But I\u2019ve never lost anyone in my life. I was too young to even remember when my great-grandparents died, or my Uncle Rick. I am definitely not ready to lose my dad.</p>\n<p>SO BACK OFF, CANCER, YOU STUPID BITCH!</p>\n<p>I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be fine, as the doctor has apparently assured. Prostate cancer has a very high survival rate and Dad is more badass than most men. He\u2019s been shot, he\u2019s jumped out of helicopters to save lives, etc. etc. But I\u2019d still appreciate the prayer thing. Or, ya\u2019 know, whatever you think will help. Voodoo doll personifying cancer, spells, curses, meditation, light a candle\u2026 I don\u2019t know very much about religions, this is clear. Or you can just give him a hug next time you see him!

To write an actual novel, I\u2019d have to go on MANY more dates and I think I\u2019d also have to try it out in other cities and on other websites for that matter.

But for now, let me just fill you in on a few memorable events that have occurred between the blog I wrote a year ago and now.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Harmless lunch at my favorite Thai place? Yes, until my date tells me that he couldn\u2019t decide whether to put straight or bi on his profile. \u201cBut I decided I do prefer girls. For example, I\u2019m very attracted to you.\u201d Oh, cool. When I said no thanks to that bedazzling gentleman caller, he offered his roommate\u2019s online username. I passed on that as well.</li>\n<li>Received a message that said, \u201cYou seem like you have brains, which is great because I\u2019m somewhat of a zombie when it comes to women. Brainssss nom nom nom!\u201d Could\u2019ve been cute and acceptable, especially since I dig The Walking Dead, a lot. But the thing was, he looked like a zombie. One of those rotting, half-eaten, reallllllmessedup zombies. I think he actually wanted to eat me\u2014nonsexual; straight-up Hannibal Lecter style.</li>\n<li>\u201cDated\u201d a guy for a bit who literally lived off of chicken fingers. He hated all vegetables, ALL ethnic foods of any kind, and he had a very serious ginger allergy. I fucking LIVE for vegetables, ethnic foods, and ginger. We could never go anywhere but Chili\u2019s and I realized we\u2019d never last long. Relationships are built on dinners, duh. We were food enemies. I also thought on multiple occasions that I was going to kill him. He\u2019d told me that his ex kissed him once, after she\u2019d just eaten ginger pork. He broke out into hives and had to epi-pen the hell out of himself. I grate ginger into a lot of meals that I cook. He\u2019d come over, I\u2019d forget, start kissing him, realize that I might be killing him, and start freaking out. Like I said, this was a solid failure of a fling. If you can\u2019t take me to a sushi joint OR kiss me after I\u2019VE been to a sushi joint, you don\u2019t deserve to be in my life. He also once told me that we had a lot of charisma. He meant chemistry. He was real pretty. Plus, he accidentally took my roommate\u2019s DVD and now, months later, keeps saying he\u2019ll bring it by but never does. I did, however, get a text the other day that simply said, \u201cShower :)\u201d\u2026 I replied, \u201cOk, cool. So about that DVD\u2026\u201d and then, a day later, he said his phone was \u201cbeing weird\u201d\u2026 Like I said, he was real pretty.</li>\n<li>One guy had real promise. He took me to a fantastic seafood restaurant on the water, he was educated, funny, AND beautiful. Something has to be wrong, right? Well, he kept dropping hints/making jokes that he was a stripper. When pressed, he said he had no job\u2014that he\u2019d saved enough money from bartending to now just live in the richest part of town and finish school. Right. On closer examination, he did look an awful lot like the guys in Magic Mike.</li>\n<li>After I\u2019d deleted my profile, one guy googled me and found this blog, commenting on a few posts and asking me out. Hi Randy!</li>\n<li>Last, but certainly not least, I met up with a guy named Tidus. I knew this name sounded a little too much like The Little Mermaid\u2019s dad. Turns out, it was his \u201cstage name.\u201d He was working extra hard to be discharged from the Navy so he could go make it big in L.A. First of all, do you think it\u2019s admirable to lie to your employer about your mental state just so you can be a captain\u2019s golf caddy for a few months before you\u2019re quietly let go, years before your signed contract? There\u2019s only one word for that: pathetic. Secondly, yes, he can sing (of course he brought his guitar), but there is no way he will ever \u201cmake it big\u201d with an attitude/ridiculous name like that. Plus, he was about 5 feet tall, with shoes, on a slight incline. Even if you reach Beiber status, I will never buy your CD, ALBERT! Oh man, what if he does make it big\u2026and sues me for this blog? Changing the real name now. Is that enough? I can\u2019t change Tidus, because of the whole Little Mermaid joke, that was classic. This is tough.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you\u2019re ever bored out of your mind, desperate and lonely, live on a manless land (Iceland or Hawaii, everywhere else has men, go find them!) and even just a creepy, erotic message would make you feel better, go online.</p>\n<p>If you ever want to take this book idea and run with it (although I\u2019m sure there are a ton just like it\u2026let me check Amazon real quick\u2026yup, a ton), go online.</p>\n<p>But if you have the slightest chance of meeting someone halfway decent\u2014without the aid of awkward multiple choice question tests, analyzing photos, checking for grammar/spelling mistakes before you even know their middle name\u2014just don\u2019t go online.</p>\n<p>Ok, Stupid?</p>\n", "post_id": 405, "location": false, "date": "01-21-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["10 years", "jack c. hays", "reunion", "kyle", "romance", "high school", "ten year reunion", "exes", "2016", "texas"], "text": "<p>I just watched 10 Years, the movie with a crazy number of famous people about a 10 year high school reunion. It was OK, not fantastic, but it did have one lasting effect: I can\u2019t stop thinking about what my 10 year high school reunion will be like. And I mean, can\u2019t stop. I figure if I write this blog, get all my wacky thoughts out of my head and onto a Word doc, I\u2019ll be free (until 2016, which, sadly, is coming up very, very soon).</p>\n<p>I\u2019m going to list the main plots of the movie and then talk about my fears/hopes/predictions for my own looming reunion. I guess you should know that I went to Jack C. Hays High School in good ol\u2019 Kyle, TX. We\u2019ve made national news a couple times for using the Confederate flag much like other people use the Bible or peace signs and painting \u201cnigger\u201d on a teacher\u2019s door. Classy, I know. Please note that when I say \u201cwe,\u201d I obviously mean the entire school, past and present students and staff, because we are all guilty, in some form or fashion. I myself, for example, went to school with so many Republicans that I thought I was one, until college hit me like a bag of Taaka bottles. I dated someone once who dipped. I owned overalls and thought that men who drove cars instead of trucks were pussies. Must I go on?</p>\n<p>You should also know that in high school, I was editor-in-chief of the newspaper, historian of Student Council, I didn\u2019t know how to dress, I have no idea what was going on with my hair, and I had a small but solid group of friends who all had similar stories. My only real boyfriend was senior year\u2026and he was a sophomore. Oh, and I had severe scoliosis; high school really wasn&#8217;t my time to shine. So there you have it. Now you\u2019re ready to read on.</p>\n<p><strong>A)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Exes</strong></p>\n<p>I already covered this, really. There will be no awkward small talk with a former lover for me, yay! Although I can\u2019t wait to watch this happen between other people.</p>\n<p><strong>B)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Looking/Acting Completely Different Now</strong></p>\n<p>I do look pretty different, in that I am now somewhat attractive, whereas in high school I think I just looked odd. My body grew too slow in all the wrong places and too fast in all the other. I was the opposite of sexy. So that might be kind of fun, especially considering that most people look worse 10 years after graduation. I plan on being very high and mighty as the leader of the very small percentage of graduates who will not be pregnant or overweight at the reunion. Suck on that, blonde beauty queen bitches (OK, some of you were nice and cool, I admit. I still hope you\u2019re all fat).</p>\n<p>But I really want to see something more significant\u2014someone who completely and utterly changed their lifestyle, walks into the room, and no one knows who they are because they\u2019re THAT shockingly different.</p>\n<p><strong>C)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Anyone Famous?</strong></p>\n<p>I don\u2019t think so. The closest is probably this one kid who\u2019s trying to make it on Broadway right now. We\u2019ve all been waiting for him to come out of the closet since high school.</p>\n<p><strong>D)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pictures</strong></p>\n<p>In the movie, there were pictures of their class hanging all over. I don\u2019t remember having many photos in the yearbook, but maybe I\u2019ll submit some winners (StuCo sleepovers, Newspaper meetings, that time I tried to make a documentary), to make sure us \u201closers\u201d are represented just as much as the prom king and queen.</p>\n<p><strong>E)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Embarrassment</strong></p>\n<p>Will we get drunk? Will anyone cause a huge scene, get into a fight, have sex in the bathroom, throw up on the dance floor? Where will this event even be held? You better believe I\u2019ll be tipsy, but I won\u2019t embarrass myself. I have to stay sober enough to remember (and capture on my iPhone) all of the sloppy happenings of the night.</p>\n<p><strong>F)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Romance</strong></p>\n<p>Although I have no exes to rekindle flames with, I do have to wonder\u2026will I still be single in 2016? I told my best friend that she\u2019ll probably meet, aka re-meet, her husband at our reunion. That\u2019d be crazy, right? Yes, there are a few people we have in mind. But they\u2019re probably like the rest of our high school: married, kids, horrible jobs. I\u2019m exaggerating. Our graduating class was about 650\u2014I\u2019d say 75% are married (some already divorced and remarried). So of that remaining 25%, take out the women, gays, unemployed, tools, and rednecks\u2026you get 5%. Of that 5%, probably half won\u2019t come because they\u2019re too busy making a lot of money, travelling the world, or saving babies. That leaves us with 2.5% but let\u2019s not forget, my friends are the cool ones who went to college, didn\u2019t knock anybody up, and now live normal, adult lives. Therefore, at least 1% of that 2.5% consists of friends who I see more as brothers. That leaves us with a whopping 9.75 men that could be potential interests the night of our reunion. Let\u2019s chop off that 0.75 because I don\u2019t like the sound of a three-fourths man. Let\u2019s subtract another two because they\u2019ll be too pretentious, ugly, or both to handle. So seven potential people who I could get handsy with by the punch bowl or make out with in the parking lot. Or, ya\u2019 know, exchange numbers and go on an actual date with later in the week. Seven sounds like WAY too high of a number, what am I forgetting to subtract?</p>\n<p>I\u2019m really looking forward to our 10 year reunion, especially after seeing that movie. My best friend doesn\u2019t want to go at all and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019ll be dragging her to it no matter what. I\u2019m just so damn nostalgic. I\u2019m dying to see how everyone\u2019s doing, what everyone looks like, who has adorable baby pictures in their wallet and who still hasn\u2019t fixed their awful eyebrows/teeth/halitosis. Who is just downright happy and who is just downright miserable? Who lights up the room? Who looks so freakin\u2019 fantastic you can\u2019t stop staring? Who comes way overdressed/underdressed? Who cries? Who will I not remember for the life of me? Who will not remember me for the life of them? Who will surprise me?</p>\n<p>Can\u2019t wait. 2016, you better be kind to me.</p>\n", "post_id": 407, "location": false, "date": "01-22-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["white house black market", "shopping", "high school job", "working", "worst job", "work", "college job", "gap", "old navy", "job", "outlet", "mall", "employee", "retail", "store"], "text": "<p>People who have never worked in retail don\u2019t realize how traumatizing it is.

That\u2019s about six years total that I spent slaving as a cashier/fashion consultant/therapist/custodian/professional liar/store manager/accountant/gossip queen/model. It was the best of times and the worst of times. More so the latter. Here\u2019s what I learned:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you ever work at a large outlet mall store, you WILL spend hours being trained on how to properly fold a t-shirt table. Talk about torture\u2014that water drip thing has nothing on this. It\u2019s a damn t-shirt, does the way it\u2019s folded actually have anything to do with the rate at which it\u2019s sold?! It does, actually. What\u2019s worse is when you\u2019re \u201cassigned\u201d to that table. As in, your job for that day is to literally stand by or near the table, folding. You fantasize about one of those buses from Mexico coming and buying the whole stock. You think seriously about spending your entire paycheck on t-shirts so that there will be less but then you remember the trucks that seem to drop off boxes of more t-shirts daily. You brainstorm t-shirt ideas of your own because if the shitty, overpriced pieces of cloth on your table can sell, so can your designs. Anyone can stamp a graphic of fruit on a 25 cent Hanes tee.</li>\n<li>Customers are DIRTY. One day, after picking up a pair of white linen slacks that were left in the corner of a dressing room, I gasped in horror after realizing that there was blood in the crotch. What kind of disgusting person does that?! It\u2019s sad that so many adults still need to watch those 5<sup>th</sup> grade menstrual cycle videos.</li>\n<li>Stores are dirtier than customers. You think that top you bought is clean enough to wear before washing? It\u2019s not. It\u2019s been all over the dusty floor, where multiple types of bugs live. You know what else has been on the floor? Sweaty feet, boogers, spit, blood, and who knows what else. You think we intensely clean every night? Ha! We mainly just hide the dirt under fixtures.</li>\n<li>When you work at a store for a certain amount of time, the clothing starts to appeal to you more and more. I blame this mostly on the employee discount, which the managers trick you into believing is SUCH a great deal. Your closet is soon taken over by your job. You begin to see that you are never NOT representing the store and you freak out and try to only wear other stuff but realize you have no other stuff and then you shrug and put on one of your ten black dresses (thanks a lot, WHBM). They still haunt me.</li>\n<li>If you have zero acting/lying skills\u2014do not work in retail. On a daily basis, you will have to tell a woman that she looks great when she looks hideous. You will have to put together outfits that you would never wear or recommend in a million years. You will have to squeeze fat rolls into a corset top and use every ounce of your strength and concentration to zip it up\u2014and then say it fits fine. This prepared me for teaching.</li>\n<li>I used to hide things that I wanted to buy later. People would stash stuff all over the damn store. You really find ways to be easily amused.</li>\n<li>Anything a cashier says they can\u2019t do\u2014they can. A few clicks on the keyboard can save hundreds of bucks. Pretty powerful feeling. This also means you can mess up, easily. One day, that idiot will be you. Your drawer will be short and managers will look you up and down, deciding if it was really an honest mistake. Screw them. Do you know how much those corporate companies make per year? More than I\u2019ll ever have in a lifetime.</li>\n<li>Don\u2019t crush on or date or hook up with a retail coworker. Wait, I think that goes for all jobs. Something about not pooping where you eat. It\u2019s always disappointing and their clothes are just so predictable (you\u2019ve put the exact outfit on a few mannequins).</li>\n<li>Black Friday is called Black Friday because everyone should wear black to the stores because it is the funeral for all retail employees. Doors open at midnight, who the fuck thought of that?! You are not saving that much money, you crazy bitches! Go home and sleep off the turkey!</li>\n<li>Be a good customer, please. Hang everything up correctly and ask whoever is helping you about their day (it\u2019s the simple things, people). Don\u2019t walk into a store ten minutes before closing and expect good service. Be courteous. Don\u2019t leave makeup and deodorant on clothing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I am beyond thrilled that I will never work in retail again\u2014once you get out, it\u2019s like you survived a tsunami and promptly moved inland. The money and boredom and bullshit is just\u2026not at all worth it, unlike teaching, where I literally make almost the same amount but my job is super fulfilling. I will say, however, that those were also some of the most fun years. The people you meet are amazing. I have some pretty great memories from those stores. But absolutely none of that nostalgia comes from being a &#8220;fitting room specialist&#8221; and it sure as hell doesn&#8217;t come from folding.</p>\n", "post_id": 415, "location": false, "date": "02-02-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["keiki", "school", "kids", "mexican", "culture shock", "hawaii", "culture", "moving", "oahu", "student", "teaching", "gang", "teacher", "texas", "adapt"], "text": "<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Gangstas v.

I\u2019ll finally get to be roommates with my best friend, I\u2019ll finally keep a job for longer than two years\u2026</p>\n<p>But honestly, there\u2019s something bothering me that I can\u2019t quite shake. It\u2019s not the fact that I\u2019m leaving paradise\u2014perfect weather, perfect tan (see <a title=\"I Heard This Place is Hard to Leave\" href=\"http://alyshakaye.wordpress.com/2012/10/27/i-heard-this-place-is-hard-to-leave/\">I Heard This Place is Hard to Leave</a>). It\u2019s the keiki, man.</p>\n<p>The kids.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve been pampered for the last two years. My students might drive me crazy, but they freakin\u2019 adore me. The biggest issue I\u2019ve ever had is their lack of motivation\u2026and I don\u2019t blame them. I\u2019d rather go to the beach than do homework too.</p>\n<p>I remember what the kids were like in school back home. Also, I\u2019m allowed to talk shit about the ghetto Mexicans and the white trash since I am both Mexican and white. Boom. Please remember that for the rest of this blog\u2026</p>\n<p>Those two types of people make up a LARGE percent of the population. Rednecks and gang members, knife fights at lunch, \u201cpinche\u201d being every other word out of most of their mouths, and a huge teen pregnancy problem. Ah, Tejas.</p>\n<p>While this is an exaggeration, it\u2019s only a slight exaggeration. So basically, I\u2019m scared.</p>\n<p>I spent 22 years in Texas, surrounded by a large Hispanic population, most of whom I was probably related to. But as for teaching experience? I\u2019ve taught approximately two Hispanic kids in the past two years. Here in Central Oahu, the student population is comprised of SO many different ethnicities\u2014Japanese, Hawaiian, Filipino, Samoan, Micronesian, Chuukese, Tongan, Korean, Chinese, and more. They\u2019re so mixed that most of them don\u2019t even know what to check for race on surveys. They think it\u2019s weird that I\u2019m \u201conly two things\u201d and they don\u2019t tease each other about being \u201ctoo much\u201d of something or \u201cnot enough\u201d of something else.</p>\n<p>Duh, there\u2019s still racism and homophobia and bullying and drug abuse and all those other terrible things that happen everywhere.</p>\n<p>But I swear, Hawaii\u2019s kids are probably the most tolerant human beings in the U.S. It\u2019s all aloha and shaka and howzit and bruddah and sistah and auntie\u2026 it\u2019s kind of crazy how happy people are here. Oh wait, the sun shines every day. There are rainbows every day.</p>\n<p>The kids I went to school with would beat these kids to a pulp and then tattoo something about it on their necks. Or they\u2019d tie my kids to cows and pour Lonestar all over them. The white kids I went to school with would call my kids Mexicans and when my kids would try to explain that they\u2019re actually a Hawaiian-Japanese-Filipino, they\u2019d say, \u201cWhatever, you\u2019re brown, so you\u2019re Mexican.\u201d The Mexicans I went to school with would call my kids wannabe Mexicans.</p>\n<p>I could go on and on, trashing and exaggerating about the kind of kids I went to school with (reminder: I\u2019m allowed), but what I\u2019m getting at is I DON\u2019T WANT TO TEACH TEXAS KIDS, I WANT TO TEACH HAWAII KIDS\u2026BUT IN TEXAS.</p>\n<p>Sigh.</p>\n<p>Will I be facing a major culture shock? It\u2019s kind of ironic, I realize. I was born and raised in the area, I\u2019m obviously super familiar with the Hispanic culture. But teaching is a different story. I\u2019ve finally reached a point where I feel qualified to teach Hawaiian mythology and \u201clocal, Pidgin kine poetry\u201d. I feel comfortable discussing and analyzing the differences and similarities of Asian cultures. I\u2019ve finally mastered the stereotypes, resentments, and unspoken bonds between these groups here\u2014it\u2019s been incredibly hard.</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><b>So will my teaching suffer?</b></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><i>Will it be like my first year all over again?</i></p>\n<p align=\"center\">What about my ELL kids? Will I know how to accommodate them? Is it the same?</p>\n<p>I know that this entire blog is probably a huge freak-out, completely uncalled for and unnecessary. I\u2019ll adapt, I\u2019ll be fine, and my memory about how horrible all the kids were is probably extremely blurry and skewed. Let\u2019s be real, I only remember one knife fight in my 13 years of schooling.</p>\n<p>Every culture is unique, and I know how important it is to learn about my students\u2019 cultures and incorporate them into my work, but does every culture require some sort of special, secret teaching skill? No, of course not. Teaching with love, passion, and curiosity is across the board\u2014that\u2019s all I need\u2026which is good, because sometimes I feel like that\u2019s all I have to offer as a teacher.</p>\n<p>Hopefully, my Mexican kids will love me just as much as my little mixed plate loco mocos do here. Hopefully they won\u2019t judge me based on the fact that my Spanish is only at an intermediate level (only when I\u2019m drunk). At least I know all the bad words, that\u2019ll be helpful.</p>\n<p>I will adapt and I will do it FAST, just like I did here. I still remember the first time I tried poke and spam musubi, thinking they looked like the most disgusting things I\u2019d ever seen. Look at me now\u2014using chop sticks like a pro and giving directions like a local.</p>\n<p>I still say flip-flops, not slippahs. Not budging on that one.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ll miss this place and I\u2019ll miss these people so much. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever love my students more than I love these, my Hawaii babies, my keiki. But you never know. All I can do is try.</p>\n", "post_id": 419, "location": false, "date": "03-09-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["poem", "tokyo", "travel", "poetry", "grand palace",

I hope this blog helps you understand why losing him to Stupid Cancer was not an option. I love you Dad!</p>\n<p>My dad taught me that if you put salt on your drink napkin at restaurants, then your glass won\u2019t stick.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s a pretty handy guy like that. He can fix anything, even if it\u2019s not broken. You know that movie quote about a guy who\u2019s lost in the woods only needing a pocket knife and a toothpick to be able to build a shopping mall? Yeah, that\u2019s my dad. He probably wouldn\u2019t even need the toothpick.</p>\n<p>He used to be really good at carrying heavy things, but his back is now just as bad as mine and his strong arms that have moved me in and out of shitty apartments have been replaced by whoever is trying to date me (or vice versa) at the moment.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s taught me how to fish. More importantly, he taught me how to get away with reading a magazine in the boat while he fishes.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s taught me a lot of \u201creals\u201d. Like what a real gentleman should be\u2014and do and say and not do and not say. What a REAL handshake and hug should feel like.</p>\n<p>He taught me how to appreciate good food. Notably\u2014freshly caught fish v. frozen, medium steak v. well done, and homemade barbeque sauce and honey mustard v. packaged. He taught me how to recognize the taste of venison when it\u2019s snuck into food, looking and acting like beef. He taught me how to cut meat properly.</p>\n<p>My dad taught me that it can always be worse\u2014you could be shot at or bitten by a rattlesnake or have to frantically jump off a hotel balcony half-naked. He taught me to \u201cget a helmet\u201d and \u201cpoop in one hand, wish in the other and see which one fills up faster\u201d. He taught me sarcasm.</p>\n<p>He taught me what kind of boys to bring home and what kind of boys to avoid. By watching the way he treats my mom, he\u2019s taught me what kind of husband I want. By experiencing the way he treats me, he\u2019s taught me what kind of father I want for my children.</p>\n<p>He has TRIED to teach me about politics, cars, the military, and history.

It\u2019s like a breath of fresh air, a complete comfort, a vacation\u2026IN HELL. Yes, I have recently moved in with my parents after two years of living on an island thousands of miles away from them. So yes, my transition from distanced paradise to a room decorated by Mom is a bit more of a struggle than some other people have had to face.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Let me also make it clear that this situation is temporary. Just another month and I\u2019ll be unpacking in my Austin apartment with my best friend.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">But how do I survive another month?! How will I survive another week?!</p>\n<p align=\"left\">No one who has lived on their own should ever, EVER have to move back in with the rents. And while I\u2019m on that note, if you\u2019re over the age of 21 but still have a roommate that pushed you out of her vagina, MOVE OUT! I understand that there are certain financial dilemmas that set some people back. But for the love of Netflix, I\u2019d be flippin\u2019 burgers all day every day if it meant my own closet-sized casa\u2014do what you gotta do!</p>\n<p align=\"left\">And don\u2019t give me that \u201cmy parents are actually really cool\u201d bullcrap. No one\u2019s parents are that cool. Cool enough to have dinner with and laugh at a movie together? Sure. Cool enough to combine whites when it\u2019s laundry day? THAT IS NOT COOL, THAT IS SAD.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">If you are living with the parentals, let me give you some fantastic reasons to get the hell outa there as fast as you can:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If you have your own place, you can bring dates home (for a glass of wine or to get laid, wherever your mind went with that\u2026let it wander). I really don\u2019t need any more reasons after this, am I right? But I do have many other reasons.</li>\n<li>You can be as messy as you want without ever hearing, \u201cYou know, it\u2019s really not that hard to&#8230;\u201d</li>\n<li>You can sleep as late as you want without your mom barging in and proclaiming loudly that, \u201cIt\u2019s almost TEN!\u201d</li>\n<li>You can be gone all night, all weekend, or all month without the SWAT team being called.</li>\n<li>You can choose what\u2019s in your fridge and pantry\u2026whether that means you can choose to go on a diet and be away from all your parents\u2019 greasy, buttery, fat-filled foods (nomnom but cellulitecellulite) or it could mean that you can choose to eat ramen and fruit roll-ups all day without hearing any lectures.</li>\n<li>Alcohol. Smoking. All things sinful. Ah, the freedom to kill brain cells. I miss it.</li>\n<li>Set the damn AC to whatever damn degree you damn well please.</li>\n<li>The TV will belong to you. The remote will belong to you. Basically, the universe is yours.</li>\n<li>Any bad decision that you want to make, any horrible idea at all\u2014you can do it without them ever even knowing\u2026 Paint your walls neon yellow, buy a pet cobra, cover every window with Adam Levine posters, break the dryer and be too cheap to fix it so you have to hang clothes all over the house, have an indoor water balloon fight, throw a massive party that ends in total destruction\u2026 You have permission\u2026because you can give yourself permission (note: you will also probably not get your deposit back).</li>\n<li>Not living with your parents means you can avoid arguments about a) politics b) life choices c) deer overpopulation (OK, this one might not be so general). When you live on your own, you can strategically avoid arguing with your parents completely. Or strategically avoid your parents, period, ha.</li>\n</ol>\n<p align=\"left\">I will hopefully survive the next month in this rehab-like institution, thanks to the dog (I do love the dog), the gym, and frequent nights out.

He\u2019s one of those crazy examples of a person who grew up dirt poor, didn\u2019t even finish high school, and yet runs a multi-million dollar company. Yeah, it\u2019s insane.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">As a person, he rocks. He always has enough booze to throw a last-minute party, he has a raspy, pipe-smoking voice that you never get tired of hearing, and he\u2019s hilarious without trying too hard to make you laugh. But I wouldn\u2019t exactly call him loving, although according to my mom he\u2019s much more affectionate than he used to be. Until very recently, I wasn\u2019t sure if he even knew very much about me. He has spelled my name incorrectly for years. I\u2019m not sure why \u201cAlyshe\u201d ever made sense, but I\u2019ve learned to accept it. He\u2019s never been the touchy-feely type\u2014I\u2019ve never heard him open up about anything and I\u2019ve never even seen him be overly warm or adoring with anyone really. His not-so-clean divorce with my grandma is somewhat of a shaky, hushed tale with a lot of holes that I think I\u2019d rather leave as holes.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Papa is extremely meat and potatoes\u2026and most of the time, just meat. If that makes sense. Every birthday and Christmas, I get an envelope with a check (no card) made out to Alyshe, whoever that bitch is.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">What I\u2019ve learned from him is that some people show love in small moments. Or rare moments. Or very small, very rare moments. It\u2019s hard to get used to, for me especially. When I love someone, I\u2019m a nut; an over-shower, a constant affection-giver, a broken record of \u201cI love you\u201d. But with Papa, you just have to bide your time, be patient, wait for that unexpected moment. For me, there are three moments I hold onto with Papa and two of them happened this summer.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">The first one was all I had for so long. I was 14 years old and I was about to undergo a spinal fusion. Obviously, I was scared shitless. I was so scared that I couldn\u2019t cry or speak or think. I remember lying there, waiting for the anesthesia to sink in, and my legs were just shaking uncontrollably. They had never done that and they haven\u2019t done that since. I don\u2019t remember who else was standing beside me, but I do remember Papa grabbing my shins with his hands and I just felt\u2026protected. Even amidst everything that was happening, I remember realizing how concerned yet comforting his face looked and how without saying anything, his grip seemed to tell me that I was going to be OK.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">I think about that moment a lot, especially when he seems distant, fading.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">In May, I graduated from University of Hawaii with my Masters and I honestly didn\u2019t think he\u2019d be on the list of people that would care. I didn\u2019t even care too much. I sat on the beach all day and drank beer instead of walking across the stage. But he shocked me by reaching out on several occasions, rambling about how I was the first in the family to get my Masters and how proud he was. It was bizarre and awesome. I guess I just always assumed he was more pleased by other family members\u2014they have good jobs and boyfriends or husbands or babies and they go to church and vote Republican and ya\u2019 know, everything he\u2019s into. Whereas I\u2019m this half Mexican liberal kid with no man, baby, or Bible who wants to be a writer.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Which brings me to the latest small moment (big moment for me). Papa has asked me to write a book for him. As in, listen to him tell his life story, help him by questioning, type it up, organize and edit, and boom. His company does publishing in house and he wants to print only enough for family and friends. But let\u2019s back up. Papa is trusting me with this? I had no idea he even knew I was a writer. I don\u2019t even think he knows that I majored in Creative Writing and interned at Simon &amp; Schuster. This came completely out of left field. He asked me very casually, as if he hadn\u2019t given it much thought at all. But the fact remains that he asked ME, Alyshe!</p>\n<p align=\"left\">This kind of scares me because his health has not been good at all and I worry that he\u2019s suddenly pushing this idea because he wants to leave something behind for us\u2026</p>\n<p align=\"left\">But mostly, I\u2019m just ecstatic to have another memory to hold onto. He may be racist and he may have followed up the writing gig offer with a comment about how I\u2019ve gained weight but he\u2019s impossible to not love (in a big, loud, showy way). He\u2019s one of those people. He can get away with anything\u2014all I have to do is remember his face in the hospital that day and his fingers rubbing the top of the lucky ladybug socks Aunt Debbie had given me\u2014and all is well and forgiven and I feel his love stronger than ever.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">I can\u2019t wait to start writing about this man, this rock of our family, this West Virginia backwoods boy turned corporation owner, my grandfather. Maybe I\u2019ll learn why he is the way he is. And maybe he\u2019ll learn how to spell my name.</p>\n", "post_id": 462, "location": false, "date": "07-18-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["cramps", "becoming a woman", "woman", "puberty", "mother nature", "bleeding", "womanhood", "period", "sex", "pregnancy", "aunt flow", "time of the month", "uterus", "female", "mother", "menstrual cycle", "health", "girl", "lady", "ovary", "days of the month"], "text": "<p align=\"left\">This topic has been fully covered in embarrassing middle school health videos, corny pre-teen flicks, and Seventeen Magazine.

I swear I could devour an entire pizza, a tray of cookies, and a pitcher of margarita, then puke it up, and then reach for a bucket of chicken and a box of chocolate. Along with ALL of these facts, add my roller coaster feelings. I\u2019m basically a bipolar blob who wants to hug you, fight you, and cry on you in the span of five minutes. I&#8217;m also trying to move into my apartment and start my new job. You DON&#8217;T wanna mess with me this week. I will destroy you.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">I hear pregnancy is like this, but 100 times worse. You might not ever see me with a baby bump if that\u2019s the case. Women have to go through all this just so we can one day go through it times 100 for nine months straight? Gee thanks, Bitch Lady.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">I mean, I haven\u2019t even mentioned the most obvious little nugget of joy\u2014we literally bleed out as if we were shot in the vagina. That\u2019s just cruel, man. Like, who the hell thought of this process? The whole stork delivery thing is genius in my opinion. Better yet, trees bear fruit, why can\u2019t they just dangle infants as well?</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Or maybe if men could understand a <i>morsel</i> of our pain and suffering\u2026ya know? Sea horses get it. I\u2019m also a big proponent of somehow making pregnancy a fair toss-up: you have unprotected sex and there\u2019s a 50/50 chance of <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">one</span> of you getting preggo. That would be sweet!</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Seriously, what do men have to deal with? Morning wood, wet dreams, shaving their mustache? Gimme a break.

I think people were mostly appalled by the race thing, but also, the teenagers could not have been more different.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Somehow, after 60 years, they\u2019re still together. She yells at him from all over the house\u2014\u201cChuck! CHUCK!\u201d\u2014and he either can\u2019t hear or pretends to not be able to hear. She still buys earrings like most people buy milk and he cooks the carne guisada she taught him how to make better than her now.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">After I was with my ex for a couple years, they decided to buy a set of $500 Wolfgang Puck pots and pans for our future wedding\u2026 I recently convinced them to go ahead and give them to me now. They could never have children, so I guess I\u2019m the closest thing they have. It\u2019s just been the two of them in their house forever\u2014complete with cars they hardly use, a massive parlor that smells like dust, purple carpet, a glittered ceiling, and a retro bar (also never used).</p>\n<p align=\"left\">They are quirky to say the least. Very old and very old fashioned. Very annoying at times (they call me every other day and almost every time, ask me if I\u2019ve met any boys). But they really do love each other. They still hold hands and she still gets lipstick on his wrinkly cheek.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">I often wonder if they have some sort of secret\u2014some magic recipe that no one seems to be passing on\u2014the ingredients of how to never get divorced. They took me out to dinner last week and this is what was said on the matter:</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Aunt Gigi: \u201cPeople always say, \u2018You have such a beautiful marriage!\u2019 and I just say, \u2018That\u2019s what YOU think!\u2019 Live while you can, Miss Alysha Mendez. Cause now, I gotta tell this man everything I\u2019m doing all the time. I miss being my own boss of everything!\u201d <i>Purses her lips and looks at Uncle Chuck with disgust but then blows him a kiss.</i></p>\n<p align=\"left\">Uncle Chuck: \u201cThere was this woman trying to get me back before we got married. She was ugly as homemade soap, trying to get me in bed! The fun is over once you reach a certain age. Now it\u2019s just pat it and say goodnight!\u201d <i>Cackles and sips his margarita as I cringe.</i></p>\n<p align=\"left\">Aunt Gigi: \u201cIf I ever have to put him in a nursing home and some young, blonde nurse is trying to give him a sponge bath, I\u2019m gonna be right there with a bat saying, \u2018WHAT DO YOU WANT?!\u2019 You just take your time, honey. Take your time. We\u2019re gonna like anybody you like. But have you met anyone? If you got it, flaunt it! And you got it, baby. If you have an itch, you better scratch it! Buy those short skirts!\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"left\">I can&#8217;t make this stuff up. I walked away laughing my ass off, like I usually do when I see the two crazy love birds, but gaining no secret, no magic ingredients, no knowledge whatsoever. They held hands, she yelled at him, she wiped lipstick from his cheek, and I dropped them off at their purple carpeted, glittered ceilinged house. Just another day.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Does this kind of thing still exist? How do you not get tired of all the little things? How do you not kill each other? How do you stay in love for over half a century? I feel like it\u2019s almost impossible these days. But I want it, ya know? We all want it. I want that whole someone by your side, skin sagging simultaneously thing. Minds turning to mush so that the only way you can remember anything is by using what little is left in both heads. It might sound depressing, but it\u2019s also quite poetic, right?

I don\u2019t remember him, but I\u2019ve seen so many pictures and watched a couple home videos and I\u2019ve heard about a million stories\u2014that\u2019s enough to know he lit up a room. He had that charm, that smile, that laugh\u2014everyone adored him. Whenever I think about him, for some reason I get this \u201880s Tom Cruise image in my head\u2014this cool cat who could make a rock fall in love with him. After a racing accident, he was in a coma for years before he passed away. My Aunt Debbie focused on her kids and then focused on their kids\u2026I didn\u2019t think she\u2019d ever truly open back up to love. Her story made me fearful\u2014I felt like she had this perfect marriage that ended too soon and once you have that kind of happiness, you just never get it again. I thought maybe people aren\u2019t allowed to have that twice. But now she has John and I see this light in her eyes that I\u2019ve never seen before. It reminds me of the pictures, the home videos, the stories\u2014it reminds me of Uncle Rick. I don\u2019t think she finally \u201cfilled a void,\u201d as the saying goes, but I think she finally made room for that same kind of big love she once had.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Our hearts are bigger than we think. I feel like we\u2019re constantly trying to cram love into a box\u2014focusing on taking things out instead of expanding.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">My Uncle Mac drove an 18-wheeler. He was in a terrible accident and became paralyzed\u2014a quadriplegic. My Aunt Kathleen had been taking care of him for over 20 years before he passed away in 2010. I\u2019ll never forget how positive he always was\u2014if he was unhappy lying in that bed all day every day, he never let on, to us at least.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">My Aunt Kathleen has similarly amazed me with her outlook on life. She is one of the craziest, most hilarious women I\u2019ve ever met (she prefers the term \u201ceccentric\u201d). I asked her this past weekend if she\u2019s dated at all. Her response was a big ol\u2019 grin, a sip of her giant Long Island, and: \u201cNot yet, there aren\u2019t any men in Kountze! Unless I want a crazy old man who has a wife. My neighbor won\u2019t stop calling\u2014he wants phone sex! Can you believe that?! Anyway, I\u2019m gonna move to Gruene and find me a man with at least a six-figure salary. That\u2019s just the way that it is. That\u2019s what I\u2019m lookin\u2019 for. I know what I want!\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Priceless. And the best part? The next day, she actually bought a piece of land in Gruene. She loved Uncle Mac deeply and always will, but she\u2019s figured out that whole expanding-heart thing. It\u2019s so great\u2014and I know that both my uncles are smiling down, relieved that their loves are open to loving again.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">I wish I could\u2019ve taken a lesson from all of this sooner. People should view every hardship in this way. I always thought the key to getting over ex-boyfriends was filling the brokenness with someone new. But other people don\u2019t fix you\u2014you have to fix yourself. Your wounds might always be wounds, your holes may stay deep and barren\u2014but your heart isn\u2019t a box with a limit. There\u2019s room for whatever, whoever, and however much. I\u2019m still working on realizing this (isn\u2019t it funny how you can realize something, but never really be done realizing it?). But I know that feeling worried and unprepared for loss is normal\u2014all I can do is keep trying to expand my heart. Current effort: making room for each and every one of my new students. Even the one that guessed my age today: 49.</p>\n", "post_id": 474, "location": false, "date": "10-05-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["city", "shady", "apartment", "oltorf", "manor", "part of town", "eastside", "butterfly bar", "food trucks", "patrizi's", "vortex", "teaching", "taco", "taqueria", "riverside", "austin", "teacher", "ghetto"], "text": "<p align=\"left\">Three words.

I can get a breakfast taco from a LEGIT, just-moved-here-illegally, mustached taqueria God at any time of the day. I also never have to mess with annoying apartment gate codes because my gate is rigged to stay open at all times. Safe? Well, there are cops and ambulances around regularly, so I honestly don\u2019t worry.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">I pay half as much as I would for a place this size in a \u201cnicer\u201d area. I\u2019m close to downtown, super close to my job, and if I was ever in some sort of trouble, I truly feel like I could knock on a neighbor\u2019s door and ask for protection. I definitely live next to some shady people. In exchange, I\u2019d help their kids learn English. That\u2019s when Lifetime would FINALLY contact me. Working titles: <i>The Teacher Next-Door, The Teacher Who Refused to Move, A Project in the Projects</i>. HAHAHA. I don\u2019t live in the projects. But you know Hollywood.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Last night, I woke up at 3:30 in the morning\u2014I thought because of the thunder. But then I heard people partying. Loudly. I guess we Texans really do love our weather, but I didn\u2019t think there was anyone who got wasted in the parking lot (in the intense downpour) and whooped every time lightning struck. This might not have anything to do with livin\u2019 inda ghetto, but it\u2019s awesome nonetheless.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Today I tried to find an alterations shop to fix one of my dresses. You know how you always hear about \u201cfronts\u201d? I\u2019m not gonna lie, when I walked into the hole in the wall shop, the owners definitely looked at each other as if to say, \u201cOh shit, an actual costumer. What are we supposed to be again, alterations, right? Not cocaine, definitely not cocaine.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Then we get to one of the best perks about living on the eastside\u2014something no one ever mentioned to me (or else I would have moved here a LOT sooner). There are some FYYYNE-ass people up in hurr. Think about it\u2014everything is cheap. What kind of people are poor (besides the obvious people mentioned above\u2026druggies, illegals, etc.)? Well, there are the starving artists\u2014yummy. The hot, young college boy toys (I can look, OK). The skinny jeaned, scarf loving hipsters, if you\u2019re into that. And then there are young professionals like me who simply refuse to pay $100 more every month just to lower their chances of getting raped. You should see the sexy people at Planet Fitness on East Riverside. It\u2019s very confusing to see so many attractive young people in one place. It\u2019s like college\u2014and it always takes me a minute to adjust and realize, oh yeah, I graduated a long time ago\u2026this is not the quad\u2026none of these people will ever be serving me a cup of trashcan punch. Going to HEB is even better\u2014right when I\u2019m convinced that I\u2019m 18 and I\u2019ve been transported to that tiny HEB right off campus, one of my students pops out from behind the bread aisle. \u201cHI MISS MENDEZ!\u201d Bubble bursted. But so worth it while it lasted\u2014I haven\u2019t felt this young since I was young.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Then there are the hidden gems of bars and food trucks. Eastside is crawling with them. My latest find was <a href=\"http://www.vortexrep.org/\">The Vortex</a> on East Manor\u2014they have live performances of different sorts. Attached is the <a href=\"http://butterflybaraustin.com/build/\">Butterfly Bar</a>, which has the coolest 1920\u2019s vibe. And outside is <a href=\"http://patrizis.com/\">Patrizi\u2019s</a>, the most delicious Italian food truck, with tons of seating and a stage for live music. But can you see any of this from the street? No. There\u2019s a shady lookin\u2019 fence you walk behind and then you\u2019re struck with the awesomeness. As is the story with a lot of bars, restaurants, stores, and food trucks on the eastside. It\u2019s part of the fun.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">So basically, if you\u2019re feeling old or bored or stale or lonely or uninteresting, get your ass over here! We are waiting with open, tattooed arms and smiling, gold-toothed, taco-filled faces.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n<p align=\"left\">\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\" align=\"left\"><em>On a serious note, as a post script\u2014the eastside is really not the ghetto. I think it used to be, maybe? But it\u2019s changed a lot. I see more of the hot people I mentioned than the shady people I mentioned, ya feel me? I mean, it\u2019s still not smart to walk around my hood in a skanky dress, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s 100% safe to do that in any area.

I\u2019ve never had so much fun doing so little. Let me tell you, I didn\u2019t get hit on ONCE. My younger self would\u2019ve thought a vacation without vacation romance would be no vacation at all. Pft, who needs a man when you\u2019re at an all-inclusive resort, sipping on rum from morning til night?</p>\n<p>Don\u2019t get me wrong, we swam with dolphins and climbed Dunn\u2019s River Falls, but we spent the majority of our spring break working on our tan, our appetite, and our alcohol tolerance. I gained about six pounds and three shades of brown.</p>\n<p>Jennifer, my co-teacher/co-captain/co-pilot/co-whatever else you can think of, DID get hit on. Hard. I literally thought they were going to kidnap her (and by they, I mean every Jamaican man in sight). The man driving us to the airport grabbed her arm and said, \u201cI don\u2019t want you to go. Stay here with me.\u201d I thought I was going to have to go all BACK OFF SHE\u2019S MINE on his ass. But most of the men just smiled and winked at her, gaping at her curvy figure. Our tour guides at Dunn\u2019s nicknamed her Shakira (I definitely called her that for the rest of the trip). Then they\u2019d glance at me and occasionally offer to sell me weed.</p>\n<p>Conclusion: Jamaica is amazing. Side note: I do not recommend going \u201coff the beaten tourist path\u201d\u2026as amazing of a country as it is, it\u2019s still extremely impoverished and therefore, well, just scary in parts.</p>\n<p>I dedicate the rest of this blog to random highlights that I typed in a note on my phone. Feel free to stop reading here.</p>\n<p>-Jennifer hadn\u2019t been on a plane in ages and was also a little sleep deprived. She rambled on and on when we were landing\u2026it went something like this: \u201cI feel like we\u2019re floating. You know how when it speeds up and then it stops? Now I feel like we\u2019re on a bungee rope. This would be a lot harder to park than my truck.\u201d</p>\n<p>-We witnessed a random drunk man stand on top of the hotel\u2019s fake waterfall and throw his flip-flops into the pool below. He wound up walking downstairs to retrieve them and I said, \u201cExcuse me, why do you hate your shoes?\u201d He slurred that he just did it to do it, considered jumping in the pool to get his flops, then said, \u201cFuck it,\u201d and stumbled back inside, barefoot.</p>\n<p>-We went out on a small sailboat one day and the driver kept repeating over and over, \u201cI\u2019m going to get you ladies so wet.\u201d Yeah\u2026awkward.</p>\n<p>-There was a snake in the ocean one morning! Freaked us out. The workers said, \u201cNo problem, mon, they don\u2019t bite. They\u2019ll just wrap around you.\u201d Cool.</p>\n<p>-We had an omelet man who we absolutely adored. As in, the same man made us a gourmet omelet every single morning. My breakfasts will never be the same.</p>\n<p>-Jennifer was too lazy to keep walking back to the bar, so she would usually show up with four drinks in her hand. Then she discovered what a Hummingbird was, and all hell broke loose. Crazy lady. She would also frequently order in interesting fashions like this: \u201cCan you just make me something blue? I want something blue.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Conclusion #2: Jamaica is the most affordable paradise I&#8217;ve ever been to. Highly recommend! And all-inclusive is definitely the way to go. I can\u2019t even explain how awesome it feels to walk up to a bar, order a beer (Red Stripe, mon!), and not have to even think about presenting an ID or money OR tip\u2014tips aren&#8217;t allowed! They win coolest accents, yummiest jerk chicken, and most rum-filled island.</p>\n", "post_id": 499, "location": false, "date": "03-30-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["art", "TX", "sculpt", "sandcastle", "vacation", "weekend getaway", "april", "sand", "gulf of mexico", "sandfest", "condo", "beach", "port aransas", "texas"], "text": "<p>Sandcastles pretty much never stop being cool, am I right?</p>\n<p>At least that\u2019s what I was raised to believe\u2014I didn\u2019t say building your own sandcastle; I just said sandcastles.

Don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014kids are just as enchanted. But I remember seeing them and just being blown away that there was a castle in front of me, ten times my size, made completely of sand. Whereas, this year, I found myself in all kinds of psychological debates (in my own head\u2026hmmm&#8230;normal?) about the possible messages. Such an English teacher.

Stephen even checked out our condo\u2019s gym (Sandcastle Condominiums are right on the beach and pretty dang awesome).

I interned at a huge pub. comp. in New York back in college and let&#8217;s just say&#8230;the market is bleak. Really depressing stuff. I watched every day as they shrugged off amazing novels only to replace them with pure crap (&#8220;This was written by Obama&#8217;s half-fourth-adopted cousin, so we can sell this and make millions!&#8221;). Plus, the writers get zero creative input and barely profit at all! After that experience, I was skeptical about any and all publishing companies.</p>\n<p>So I started looking into the scary self-pub world.</p>\n<p>I definitely could&#8217;ve done a LOT of this work on my own, but HELLO I also have a job wrangling 100 pre-teens every day&#8230;plus I do like to have somewhat of a social life.

Magic rocks.<em><br />\n</em></p>\n<p><em>2) Do you tell the truth, lie, or keep secrets the most? </em>Hmmm&#8230;I feel like I tell the truth TOO much sometimes. My friends say I&#8217;d be Candor if we lived in <em>Divergent</em>&#8216;s world.<em><br />\n</em></p>\n<p><em>3) If you could try any exotic food, what would it be? </em>I looove trying new food. One I haven&#8217;t tried yet is Ethiopian- I&#8217;ve heard good things.<em><br />\n</em></p>\n<p><em>4) Do you have a hidden talent?</em> I am fantastic at NOT showering, but looking like I did.</p>\n<p><em>5) Who is your biggest role model?</em> My madre, for sure. She is a genuine badass.</p>\n<p><em>6) Why and when did you start writing? </em>I&#8217;ve been writing since I was really little- being an only child forces your imagination to run wild.<em><br />\n</em></p>\n<p><em>7) Would you rather be invisibility powers or be able to see things that are invisible? Why? </em>I don&#8217;t believe in ghosts/spirits so I guess I&#8217;d have to go with the first option!<em><br />\n</em></p>\n<p><em>8) Favorite book? </em>Oh, goodness, tough. I will always have a huge spot in my heart for the classic, <em>Catcher in the Rye</em>.<em><br />\n</em></p>\n<p><em>9) Put these in order to your liking for which is most important to you the most to the least: Money, Love, or Time. </em>I&#8217;m a teacher so money is obviously last, ha! Love and Time are super hard to choose from. I&#8217;m one of those people who freak out -often- about wasting time/not having enough time. But love is something I dream of having again.<em><br />\n</em></p>\n<p><em>10) Do you have any weird habits? </em>When I eat pizza, I take one bite of the &#8220;front&#8221; and then one bite of the crust and then repeat.

Where y&#8217;all at?</p>\n<p>Looking for any and all willing bloggers/reviewers/critics (What do you like to be called?! Geez.) &#8211; I&#8217;d love to send a copy of my novel, <em>The Waiting Room</em>, to you for consideration!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>A little bit about my novel and I (isn&#8217;t it cute how we sound like a couple?)</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:12.727272033691px;\">About the author:</span><br style=\"font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:12.727272033691px;\" /> <span style=\"font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:12.727272033691px;\">Alysha Kaye was born in San Marcos, TX, where she also received her BA in Creative Writing from Texas State University. She worked in marketing for a brief and terrible cubicle-soul-sucking time until she was accepted into Teach for America and promptly moved to Oahu. She taught 7th grade English in Aiea for two years and also received her Masters in Education from University of Hawaii. She now teaches in Austin, TX and tries to squeeze in as much writing as possible between lesson planning. She dreamt about\u00a0</span><i style=\"font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:12.727272033691px;\">The Waiting Room</i><span style=\"font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:12.727272033691px;\">\u00a0once, and offhandedly wrote her boyfriend a love poem about waiting for him after death. Somehow, that became a novel.</span><br style=\"font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:12.727272033691px;\" /> <br style=\"font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:12.727272033691px;\" /><span style=\"font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:12.727272033691px;\">Summary</span><span style=\"font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:12.727272033691px;\">\u00a0of\u00a0</span><i style=\"font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:12.727272033691px;\">The Waiting Room</i><span style=\"font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:12.727272033691px;\">:</span><br style=\"font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:12.727272033691px;\" /> <span style=\"font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:12.727272033691px;\">Jude and Nina are the epitome of that whole raw, unflinching love thing that most people are jealous of. That is, until Jude dies and wakes up in The Waiting Room, surrounded by other souls who are all waiting to pass over into their next life. But unlike those souls, Jude\u2019s name is never called by the mysterious \u201creceptionist\u201d. He waits, watching Nina out of giant windows. He\u2019s waiting for her. What is this place?

Unless you&#8217;ve been living under a very large and very heavy rock, then you know this one beautiful yet terrifying fact: social media is truly the current leader of the world.</p>\n<p>Self-publishing means self-marketing in most cases and IT IS NOT EASY. Le sigh. If I was rich, I would immediately pay someone to do all of this constant, tedious humble bragging for me, but alas, I am&#8230;a middle school teacher.</p>\n<p>So what do you do? You want your book to sell. You want a readership that includes more than just obligated family and friends. But you&#8217;re just a laid-back WordPress blogger at heart! You have no interest in Pinterest (see what I did there?)!</p>\n<p>Facebook was easy. I do love Facebook. So the official <a title=\"Alysha Kaye Author Facebook page\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AuthorAlyshaKaye\" target=\"_blank\">author page</a> is up and running! I&#8217;m up to 225 likes. It definitely required bullying my friends and family into sharing the page and inviting their friends to like the page. I looked into Facebook advertisement, figuring, &#8220;How expensive could it possibly be?&#8221; Yeah. The answer is &#8220;too expensive.&#8221; Hopefully, when the lovely bloggers who have promised to write book reviews post said book reviews, the likes will build!</p>\n<p>I was suuuuper hesitant to leap into the Twitter world. I created one years ago to see what all the fuss was about. And &#8220;fuss&#8221; is definitely the correct word. Twitter is filled with a ton of CRAP that you have to wade through in order to read something that&#8217;s actually interesting. You have to be VERY careful about who you follow. I messed up BIG TIME. I had no idea there was a follow limit! Amateur status. In my mind, the more people I follow=the more possible readers. So I became click happy, not even looking at who I was following. Then Twitter informed me that there&#8217;s a 2,000 follow limit. So now that I&#8217;ve found fellow writers whose tweets I actually WANT to read, I can&#8217;t even follow them unless I go unfollow someone else! Way to go, Alysha. I have connected with quite a few great people though, and I&#8217;m up to 800 followers.</p>\n<p>Follow me here: <a title=\"Alysha Kaye Twitter\" href=\"https://twitter.com/alyshakaye7\" target=\"_blank\">alyshakaye7</a></p>\n<p>My legit author website is in the works (the address will be <a href=\"http://www.alyshakaye.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.alyshakaye.com</a>).</p>\n<p>I am officially on Goodreads.

Eh, I just can&#8217;t commit to those platforms, I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s so unappealing to me, but I just can&#8217;t.</p>\n<p>My WordPress continues to be my true social media passion.

Are we reunited with our loved ones? In The Waiting Room, Jude, a thirty year old man, is killed in a car accident. He awakens in a \u2018waiting room,\u2019 where the dead go before they move on to their next life. Except, Jude, isn\u2019t moving on.</p>\n<p>He spends his time watching his wife Nina, wishing he could be reunited with her. From the variety of waiting room assistants including his friend Joe, he learns that people move on quickly. Everyone except him. Is he an anomaly? Or is his love for Nina keeping him there?</p>\n<p>Alysha Kaye creates an interesting concept on what the afterlife is like and how love doesn\u2019t die. A thoroughly enjoyable book that makes you think. Highly recommended.</p>\n<p>The Waiting Room is out on July 1st 2014 and will be available to buy through Amazon.<br />\n@alyshakaye7<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AuthorAlyshaKaye\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/AuthorAlyshaKaye</a><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.alyshakaye.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">www.alyshakaye.wordpress.com</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Thanks again, Sam!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Check out her author website <a href=\"http://www.skgregory.com/\">http://www.skgregory.com/</a></p>\n", "post_id": 582, "location": false, "date": "06-04-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["novel", "book blog", "book review", "alysha kaye", "indie", "blogger", "author", "writing", "book release", "coming soon", "amazon", "Books", "the waiting room", "critique", "reviewer", "fiction", "book boost", "book preview"], "text": "<div class=\"wpcom-reblog-snapshot\"><div class=\"reblogger-note\"><p class=\"reblogger-headline\"><img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0c5383ea45a76189c55c69e1beba3ae5?s=32&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-32' height='32' width='32' /><a href=\"http://alyshakaye.wordpress.com/author/alyshakaye/\">Alysha Kaye</a>:</p><div class='reblogger-note-content'><blockquote><p>Second review of THE WAITING ROOM- 4 stars!!!</p>\n</blockquote></div></div><div class=\"reblog-post\"><p class=\"reblog-from\"><img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8323bf74b59609ab45ff63bd2b7b382c?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />Originally posted on <a href=\"http://virnaaryanita.wordpress.com/2014/06/05/book-review-the-waiting-room-by-alysha-kaye\">Virna Aryanita</a>:</p><div class=\"reblogged-content\">\n<p><a href=\"http://alyshakaye.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/the-waiting-room-print-03-e1401966668349.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-727 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"http://alyshakaye.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/the-waiting-room-print-03-e1401966668349.jpg?w=469&#038;h=695\" height=\"695\" width=\"469\" alt=\"The Waiting Room Print 03\"></a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Rate: 4 out of 5 stars.

So without further ado, here are my thoughts on\u00a0<em>The Waiting Room</em>, which turned out to be an absolute delight to read.</p>\n\n<p>First, a brief summary from <a href=\"http://alyshakaye.com/\">the author\u2019s website</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p style=\"color:#000000;\">Jude and Nina are the epitome of that whole raw, unflinching love thing that most people are jealous of. That is, until Jude dies and wakes up in The Waiting Room, surrounded by other souls who are all waiting to pass over into their next life. But unlike those\u2026</p></blockquote>\n</div><p class=\"reblog-source\"><a href=\"http://taraolivero.wordpress.com/2014/06/16/review-the-waiting-room\">View original</a> <span class=\"more-words\">546 more words</span></p></div></div>", "post_id": 605, "location": false, "date": "06-17-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["love", "Creative Commons", "alysha kaye", "indie", "fantasy", "july 1", "book promo", "book review", "author", "writer", "romance", "reincarnation", "reading", "predestination", "amazon", "book trailer", "book boost", "book preview", "novel", "Books", "the waiting room", "summer read"], "text": "<p>Whew, I could be on Creative Commons ALL.

You can get lost.</p>\n<p>If I was a little more tech-savvy, this process would&#8217;ve been much smoother, faster, and the product muchhh more professional. HOWEVER:</p>\n<p>I finally made a book trailer for THE WAITING ROOM. And I&#8217;m proud of it, amateur-status and all.</p>\n<p>Check it out:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a title=\"The Waiting Room book trailer\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04mLpOfNhIA&amp;feature=youtu.be\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Waiting Room</em> &#8211; book trailer</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Tips for fellow authors wanting to make a book trailer:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If you don&#8217;t want to spend money (like me) then DON&#8217;T! Plenty of great, free resources&#8211;you just have to cite!</li>\n<li>DON&#8217;T FORGET TO CITE.</li>\n<li>Remember, you&#8217;re not making a MOVIE trailer. This is a book trailer&#8230;and people who watch it know that. So don&#8217;t get caught up in the visuals&#8211;your audience should know that the clip&#8217;s purpose is to further explain your novel&#8211;to hook them into reading and coming up with their own visuals.</li>\n<li>Don&#8217;t use your synopsis unless it works. My little back cover blurb is short and simple, so I think (hope) it worked. But I&#8217;ve seen other people add WAY too much text.</li>\n<li>If you&#8217;re worried about your readers getting a preconceived character image, then don&#8217;t use images that give them that!</li>\n<li>Get the opinion of others&#8211;not just other writers. Show it to a friend and ask how it made them feel. Which images captured their attention and which images didn&#8217;t?</li>\n<li>Have fun with it! Let it revamp you.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Remember: <em>The Waiting Room</em> releases July 1!</p>\n", "post_id": 609, "location": false, "date": "06-22-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["love", "alysha kaye", "indie", "book release", "fantasy", "critic", "july 1", "critique", "self-publish", "book promo", "publishing", "book review", "author", "writing", "romance", "reading", "amazon", "editing", "book boost", "novel", "Books", "the waiting room", "book cover"], "text": "<div class=\"wpcom-reblog-snapshot\"><div class=\"reblogger-note\"><p class=\"reblogger-headline\"><img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0c5383ea45a76189c55c69e1beba3ae5?s=32&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-32' height='32' width='32' /><a href=\"http://alyshakaye.wordpress.com/author/alyshakaye/\">Alysha Kaye</a>:</p><div class='reblogger-note-content'><blockquote><p>5th country to review my book &#8211; Japan!</p>\n<p>Check out this awesome blogger:</p>\n</blockquote></div></div><div class=\"reblog-post\"><p class=\"reblog-from\"><img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/3cc1c5b3f2a095b16fa303e6e8315287?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />Originally posted on <a href=\"http://seikaiha.wordpress.com/2014/06/23/book-review-the-waiting-room-by-alysha-kaye\">seikaiha\u2019s blah-blah-blah</a>:</p><div class=\"reblogged-content\">\n<p><a href=\"http://alyshakaye.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/1000x1600.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image\" src=\"http://alyshakaye.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/1000x1600.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></a></p>\n\n<p>The book title: \u201cThe Waiting Room\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The author: Alysha Kaye</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The release date: July 1st, 2014</p>\n\n<p>*It will be available at Amazon.com.

Both schools have posted about my upcoming novel on their Facebook pages, Twitter accounts, and even their main websites. It&#8217;s been incredible.</p>\n<p>So thank you KTSW, for this opportunity!

And yes, even you, you Smashwords page-turners.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s face it&#8211;authors don&#8217;t care HOW you read their books or HOW you buy their books&#8211;we&#8217;re just over the moon if you DO buy and read our books!</p>\n<p>All of this is to say that I&#8217;ve been persuaded to try out Amazon&#8217;s Kindle Select Program. If you&#8217;re not a crazed self-published author, let me explain a bit.</p>\n<p>The Kindle Select Program offers various *free* promotional deals to authors IF and only if the authors agree to sell exclusively through Amazon for the first 90 days. No Barnes &amp; Noble, no Apple, no Smashwords, etc.</p>\n<p>At first, I was outraged. I was very all-caps: MY NOVEL WILL BE AVAILABLE TO WHOMEVER WANTS TO BUY IT GODDAMMIT!</p>\n<p>But then I was like&#8230;Oh yeah, this is my first novel. I am&#8230;a teacher. I am&#8230;poor. I&#8230;have nothing to lose.</p>\n<p>Free promotion is kiiiiinda hard to pass up. This <a href=\"http://karol.gajda.com/kdp-select/\" target=\"_blank\">blog</a> really helped me make up my mind- gracias, Karol.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So I am EXTREMELY sorry if you&#8217;re NOT a Kindle reader. This truly upsets me greatly. BUT, Amazon will still have the paperback available OR you can wait 90 days, when I will probably expand markets.

It was just somewhere for me to put my writing in case I wanted someone to see it. I have almost 100 followers now (which might not seem like much, but I never expected it) and if that many people are interested in what I\u00a0have to say, I think it\u2019s time for me to give this blog a little structure and consistency.</p>\n\n<p>So for the next two weeks, it\u2019s going to be running on bare bones (I really do hope that\u2019s a saying) while I get set up for a complete blog overhaul.

This isn\u2019t intended to be a theological treatise or an argument for reincarnation, rather it provides a nice narrative framework to address these issues within the story arc. \u00a0For a little more formal description.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Jude and Nina are the epitome of that whole raw, unflinching love thing that most people are jealous of.

Books were a much-needed escape for me. I used to read as much as I breathed (too bad now I have a job and obligations, haha). Each book I read inspired me to write. When I was in middle school, my English teacher submitted one of my stories to a magazine and I won first place!

Greece- Was anyone else obsessed with The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants when they were younger? Yeah, I&#8217;ll be on the lookout for Kostas.</p>\n<p>3. Turkey, the country- Please send good, safe vibes since it&#8217;s not exactly a prime time to travel there&#8230; Also: we&#8217;re going on a hot air balloon ride. Be jealous.</p>\n<p>4. Turkey, the lunchmeat- Bring it on, freshmen.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sidenote: it&#8217;ll be really nice to get away from all the book marketing exhaustion.

Well, two opportunities actually- in the last few weeks, I&#8217;ve had TWO offers from two very different indie publishers. It should be a dream come true, right? Right?! How could I even be considering turning them both down?</p>\n<p>Sigh.</p>\n<p>So many things to think about here.</p>\n<p>First of all, one of the publishers is e-book only. BUT, I&#8217;d get to keep the print rights- so technically, I&#8217;d still be self-published with the paperback version. I don&#8217;t know how I feel about that though- they wouldn&#8217;t be linked on Amazon. Different edits, different covers&#8230;it&#8217;d be like having two completely different books out there&#8230;</p>\n<p>Not to mention, I LOVE my current cover. And then there&#8217;s the reviews to think about&#8230;I cherish each and every review I&#8217;ve received on Amazon and Goodreads. If I take the book down and sign a contract with a publisher, I lose all of those kind words that are sooo dear to me!</p>\n<p>While I&#8217;m rambling, let&#8217;s go ahead and throw in the bizarre moral obligation I feel to the wonderful self-pub world. A strange guilt has washed over me at the mere thought of abandoning my proud post as ALYSHA KAYE, SELF-PUBLISHED AUTHOR.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s also the inevitable feeling of, &#8220;What if an even BETTER offer comes along, and I just need to wait it out?&#8221;</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a tough call to say the least. I wish I had a year to think it over, but I&#8217;ll be making a decision before this month is over I&#8217;m sure.

That is, until Jude dies and wakes up in The Waiting Room, surrounded by other souls who are all waiting to pass over into their next life.

It looks phenomenal; I can\u2019t wait to see it. I also just found out that it\u2019s a BOOK. So now I of course want to read it first. I think the reason I can\u2019t stop watching the trailer is because of the symmetry I feel it has to my life right now. A monarch of the family passes away and brings the family together. They are a crazy family to say the least. Spending that much time together is like torture. Yup. And then of course there\u2019s the line that we can all relate to: \u201cIs it the whole world or is it just this family?\u201d</p>\n<p>I hope it\u2019s the whole world.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve lost two people this year\u2014my amazing Uncle Chuck and my lovely grandmother. It\u2019s strange to me that there are so many different reactions to death. Funerals seem to bring out the best and worst in some people. And I guess that makes sense when you think about it.</p>\n<p>I find myself NEEDING to write about it\u2014not to vent, not to talk shit, not to complain or whine or bitch or moan or whatever\u2014but this is MY way. This is what I do. I think that\u2019s clear to my friends and family by now, that I write (about <em>everything</em>). If they haven\u2019t figured that out, I\u2019m not sure what more I can do\u2026I\u2019ve already published a freakin\u2019 novel.</p>\n<p>In <em>This Is Where I Leave You</em>, in true movie fashion, the family comes together even though they\u2019re insanely different and maybe-kinda-sorta hate each other at times. Tina Fey\u2019s character puts it perfectly when she says, \u201cYou guys are idiots, but you\u2019re MY idiots.\u201d</p>\n<p>I wish I always felt like all the people in my life (friends, family, coworkers, students, ex-students\u2026) were MY idiots. But ya\u2019 know what? It\u2019s OK to just think they\u2019re just idiots sometimes (or most of the time\u2026or all of the time).</p>\n<p>When a student decides to say, \u201cChinga tu madre!\u201d to another student riiiight in front of you, it\u2019s OK. When your cousin chooses to go to a sorority function instead of Grandma\u2019s memorial, it\u2019s OK. When people freak out about what\u2019s was left for them in the will even though everyone knows there was\u00a0barely anything more than a teacup collection\u2026it\u2019s OK. When a student decides it\u2019s acceptable to bite your arm\u2026it\u2019s definitely fucking OK.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">[See how I sandwiched that? Teachers: you can always use funny student stories to buffer real-talk.]</p>\n<p>I wish I hadn\u2019t started bawling for no apparent reason last night at Aunt Gigi\u2019s as we were celebrating her birthday. But I was looking around that house and suddenly, all I could see was the absence of my uncle, flipping tortillas and laughing. I wish no one was that interested in money. I wish everyone cared about celebrating peoples\u2019 lives more than they care about celebrating their possessions.</p>\n<p>I wish everyone could be calm and collected and poised and respectful about death, but that\u2019s like saying I wish everyone was the same, which would be terrible. I guess, mainly, I just wish that love was visible\u2014in everything, in everyone, even in the darkest, most selfish times. If it was only peeking out, barely noticeable, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d feel as rage-cage.</p>\n<p>But just like it\u2019s OK to feel like some people are idiots and not MY idiots, I guess it\u2019s OK for love to hide. Maybe it\u2019s one of those, \u201cHow would we really know what it was if it wasn\u2019t gone sometimes?\u201d things. Whatever.</p>\n<p>All I know is funerals are the worst, people can also be the worst, everything is the worst sometimes. But love is drinking tea with your grandma and flipping tortillas with your uncle and when those people are gone, love is hugging your idiots who know exactly what you mean.</p>\n", "post_id": 776, "location": false, "date": "09-20-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<div class=\"wpcom-reblog-snapshot\"> <div class=\"reblog-post\"><p class=\"reblog-from\"><img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/5c7ab7e6229f4cb96cbb07c0011d90ba?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />Originally posted on <a href=\"http://crippledatyourtable.wordpress.com/2014/09/21/review-the-waiting-room-by-alysha-kaye\">crippledatYourtable</a>:</p><div class=\"reblogged-content\">\n<p>Author\u2019s Note: Trying something different out..reviewing a book by an AMAZING new author.

No one likes that pretentious-never-smiling writer who goes around constantly sighing about how their agent and editor just &#8220;don&#8217;t see eye to eye.&#8221; Oh please.</p>\n<p>I make a living telling kids to capitalize and spit out their gum. I write on the side. I get two sad paychecks a month, break up two fights a year, and hand out maybe two stickers a day. I write on the side.</p>\n<p>In case you don&#8217;t have a clear enough picture of my glamorous life yet, this was the simultaneous response of almost every class when I began with &#8220;I have some great news&#8230;&#8221;:<br />\n&#8220;YOU\u2019RE PREGNANT?!?!&#8221;</p>\n<p>That, as you can imagine, made the news of my novel seem quite arbitrary. Oh, our teacher isn&#8217;t having a baby out of wedlock? Well then we don&#8217;t really care.</p>\n<p>Yeah.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m not going to lie, as a self-published author, it\u2019s easy to get caught up in Twitter followers, Facebook likes, WordPress reblogs, Goodreads ratings, and Amazon reviews. It\u2019s even easier to get lost in the black hole of \u201crefreshing\u201d the Kindle and CreateSpace sales pages.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s what I have my darling pre-teens for. They may irk me with their constant struggle of \u201cIs a lot really two words, Miss?\u201d but they definitely, DEFINITELY teach me to get over myself.</p>\n<p>You can\u2019t be a clich\u00e9 snobby writer AND break up spit ball invasions. You can\u2019t be a clich\u00e9 snobby writer AND secretly bribe a student with chocolate before school to kill a classroom cockroach. You can\u2019t be a clich\u00e9 snobby writer AND calmly tell a student to stop making \u201csexual noises\u201d during the state standardized test. And you definitely, definitely can\u2019t be a clich\u00e9 snobby writer AND keep a straight face when a student asks you, \u201cMiss, why do all white people like to rhyme all the time?\u201d</p>\n<p>I think every author out there truly needs someone (or hundreds of mini-someones) to keep them humble. I\u2019m sure even J.K. Rowling has a bubble-burster. Probably someone who gloats to her about Avatar doubling the sales of every Harry Potter film. But seriously, where would we be without these parade-rainers?</p>\n<p>Granted, there are different types of these \u201cantagonists\u201d. Not everyone can be as lucky as me\u2014mine are cute and almost impossible to stay angry with (I said almost). My students make fun of me for not being married and then, in the next breath, accidentally call me Mom. They make fun of my clothes and then, a minute later, they\u2019re hugging me or begging me to read their poem or asking if I\u2019ll be at their soccer game. But trust me, I have the more evil-type-naysayers as well. I like to call them h8ters or swag-less (my students may or may not have taught me those words).</p>\n<p>These Negative Nancys are necessary, I\u2019m telling you! You don\u2019t want to end up ALONE, smoking a pipe in front of a fireplace, wearing only wool argyle, and refusing to speak to anyone but your typewriter (because no one else deserves your esteemed attention). NO! Also, you don\u2019t want to end up an alcoholic-addict-suicide-Hemingway type. I mean, being Hemingway would be cool\u2026but you know what I mean. Don\u2019t take yourself seriously. Ever. You\u2019ll lose something. And in turn, your writing will lose something. And then you\u2019ll lose your readers. Boom. Is your mind blown?</p>\n<p>While you may not be walking around the halls of your employment wearing dry erase marker streaks on your white dress, I encourage you to find your own path to absurdity.

Not a smurf, not an Avatar, not Genie, and DEFINITELY not Beetlejuice (to the bro who guessed that at Container Bar on Rainey: You. Are. An. Idiot.)</p>\n<p>I had an amazing time with my friends (a goddess, an 80&#8217;s chick, a pirate, and Rainbow Brite), drank that PERFECT amount that only causes a slight morning headache, and somehow managed to convince multiple people (friends AND one handsome stranger&#8230;or WAS he handsome&#8230;?) to help reapply that cheap blue paint when it started to crust off.</p>\n<p>It was win complete with food truck tacos, our friend&#8217;s band performance at Gypsy Lounge, and next-day Kerbey Lane brunch.</p>\n<p>All of this coincides with an overused, but relevant expression: People don&#8217;t change. I&#8217;ve been thinking about this a lot lately&#8211;the catalyst being the same catalyst for so much in my life&#8230;doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results (insanity as old Alby calls it).</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m usually so good at recognizing it and steering away, self-solving. When I applied for Teach for America Hawaii. When I forced myself to finish my novel and self-publish. When I decided to start teaching high school instead of middle school. When I promised myself at least one new country per year. But I guess those are so internally-based, 100% me, myself, and I&#8230;it&#8217;s so much harder when you&#8217;re only 50% of a relationship. Your expectations of another person- a friend, a family member, a boyfriend, an i-wish-you-were-my-boyfriend, etc&#8230;are probably insane. That&#8217;s how I&#8217;ve been feeling lately at least.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what I mean: if people don&#8217;t change (I mean the true, real, nitty-gritty of a person), then why do we keep expecting them to? Human nature I guess. WELL I QUIT GODDAMMIT.</p>\n<p>I shall expect nothing. Except, ya&#8217; know, normal things that I&#8217;ve always expected and that are totally normal to expect because they derive from that person&#8217;s true self. Like&#8230;I will always expect my mother to use the word &#8220;Behave&#8221; via text/phone call on Halloween night, regardless of the fact that I am nearing 30 years old.</p>\n<p>But other than that sort of stuff- nada. People rarely change. I like that better. Because, ya&#8217; know, there are those fall-through-the-crack exceptions to the rule who truly, truly change. But if a guy has been treating you fairly shit-tastically for quite some time&#8230;chances are, that&#8217;s not changin&#8217; any time soon, darlin&#8217;. Yes, I&#8217;m talking to myself here, people, just allow it. Stop insanely expecting some life-altering 360-degree turn-around. That&#8217;s just the Disney princess inside of you.</p>\n<p>On October 31st, you&#8217;ll see tiaras, cat-eye contacts, wigs, fake tats, masks, and tutus. It&#8217;s really fun and you&#8217;ll be like, &#8220;OHMERGERD YOUR JON SNOW HAIR IS LIKE, SPOT ON.&#8221; But people don&#8217;t change their entire personality/outlook/morals/ethics/attitude.</p>\n<p>People get haircuts and people have good days where they&#8217;ll say something particularly nice to you. But if, on all those other, normal days&#8230;they don&#8217;t say anything nice&#8230;ever&#8230;why keep &#8216;em around? Choose who you surround yourself with. Choose to surround yourself with people who you can expect to be there for you- people who make you feel completely safe having that expectation of them. NOT people who constantly let you down and leave you expecting &#8220;maybe a different outcome next time&#8230;or the next time&#8230;or the next time.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Happy Halloween, fellow bloggers <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)</span> I hope the night was everything you expected it to be and I hope your company was everything you expected them to be.

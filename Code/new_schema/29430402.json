Judith is working on a novel and has many beautiful and inspirational posts to browse on her blog.  Please take a few minutes to check it out.</p>\n<p>As for the Award, there are a few conditions before I can accept it completely.</p>\n<p>- 7 new and interesting things about myself, not yet revealed on this blog:</p>\n<p>1) I used to breed African Lovebirds as a teenager.  I had 3 pairs, one cream coloured, one bright yellow, and one olive green variety.<br />\n2) I am not much of a dancer, but give me a couple of drinks and I will soon forget.  Watch your toes, though&#8230;<br />\n3) I was a vegan for a while, until I realized that vegetables have feelings too.  Now I just live off of sunshine.<br />\n4) That last one is only half-true&#8230; I require copious amounts of salt water as well.<br />\n5) I was somewhat of a local legend in highschool&#8230; but only amongst the senior community-theater going crowd.  I was in the newspaper more times than I can remember, always with my mouth wide open and my eyes closed.  Everyone in town could recognize my tonsils&#8230;<br />\n6) At a cast party after one of these shows, my family doctor informed me, after several glasses of wine, that if he could make it through medical school anyone could&#8230;  I remembered thinking to myself that it did seem odd that he had graduated&#8230;<br />\n7) My dreams of being a doctor ended rather quickly when I got a D in first year physics&#8230; oops.  Looks like I will need a new way to help people&#8230;</p>\n<p>I will be nominating others for this award as well, but I need a little time to digest it.  I do not like just throwing nominations around.  I want to make sure the right blogs are receiving the awards.

I am feeling much better, except for my back.  My back is so sore right now, from coughing, shivering and vomiting pretty much non-stop for the last 3 days.  When you are sick it is easy to get down in the dumps about other aspects of your life as well.  </p>\n<p>All I want from life at this moment in time is a backrub.  Yet this appears to be a lot to ask.  The truth of the matter is, I do not have anyone in my life at the moment who is interested in giving me a backrub.  Not anyone close by enough to be a real option, at least.</p>\n<p>So, after thinking about it for a while I realized that maybe some stretching would help my back.  I took a long deep stretch and it helped for a second.  I decided to ask my brother if he would join me in some Yoga in the morning. I explained how my back is killing me and how I thought some exercise might help.</p>\n<p>He agreed and then went on to surprise me.  My brother went into his room and dug out his old heating pad that I had completely forgotten that he owns.  He recommended I plug it in and lie down for a bit.</p>\n<p>It was not a backrub, but I have to say, this gesture was huge for me this evening.  I was starting to get all sad about the fact that I would not be receiving any backrubs in the near future.  I was forgetting that Love is easy.  I was forgetting that Love appears in many forms.  Sometimes touch.  Sometimes simply in the form of an idea.</p>\n<p>My back feels much better now, thanks to my brother.  I would not have thought of that without him.  Love is easy, it turns out.  You just have to talk.  And be willing to receive. </p>\n<p>I may not get to lie down next to my lover tonight, or get that backrub I wanted so bad.  But I did receive Love and for that my back feels much better.  My heart feels a little better too.</p>\n", "post_id": 1069, "location": false, "date": "03-12-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "", "post_id": 1087, "location": false, "date": "03-13-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>The first step to earning the Living in Love award is producing one Random Act of Kindness and blogging about it.

Hear me out. Sustainability, to me, is not just about being ecological, green (whatever that trendy term means nowadays) and frugal, it\u2019s also about human beings existing in a unified and peaceful state. Human kind will never be sustainable if Peace is not achieved.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve been spending a lot of time inside my own head lately, meditating on how to create Peace and Love within myself, and how to best go about spreading it to others. You can\u2019t force ideals onto somebody else, it just doesn\u2019t work. Everyone has to come to a position of Peace in their own time. So if you can\u2019t sit someone down and tell them (in a know-it-all manner, of course) that they must be Peaceful and they simply have to Love and Respect everyone, how on earth can you get others to live in Peace?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I could have meditated for years on that question, but something happened today that showed me the answer in a way that made it crystal clear that I am on the right path to creating a more Peace filled existence. I was in the Supermarket <small><small>(I know, not local, and definitely not a sustainable place to shop. Not a heck of a lot of options in my town however, so I deal) </small></small> and there were lines for days. Now, being the stealthy supermarket shopper that I am, I was easily able to seek out the line with the shortest wait time. You can\u2019t just avoid the cashiers with the longest lines, that\u2019s a rookie mistake. It\u2019s what\u2019s in the carts that count. Sure, lane 6 may only have three people in line, but they\u2019re all buying groceries (read: a whole bunch of tiny items). Lane 7, on the other hand, has 9 people in line, but with an average of only three to four large items in their carts. That\u2019s my line.</p>\n<p>So, there I stand, patiently waiting my turn (and unabashedly skimming the trashy magazines), when customer #3 in Lane 6 starts getting impatient. No fireworks, just cursing not quite under his breath about the wait time. My line moves ahead and I put my two items on the conveyor belt. #3 loses it.</p>\n<p>\u201cI swear to God, if one more person gets to check out before I do I\u2019m gonna\u2013 Hey, you!\u201d He gestures to the manager to come over and approaches her in a very aggressive demeanor. He leans over her, puts his finger to her chest and says, in a not so quiet voice \u201cDon\u2019t you idiots know how to train your employees here? First come, first serve, that\u2019s the fair way to wait on customers. This cashier must be slow,if you know what I mean, because that line\u2019s going 100 times faster than this one. I\u2019ve been waiting here forever and I want to be waited on NOW!\u201d</p>\n<p>Now, I\u2019m not sure how the manager responded, because she some how managed to stay patient, calm and most importantly, quiet. Ido know how #3 responded, though, because he was not as quiet.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is ridiculous. She (offensive finger jabbed in my direction) got here TEN minutes after me and she\u2019s ready to check out now\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>You get the idea. He went on, and on\u2026. and on. I won\u2019t go on, there was much more cursing involved and even I was offended by the end, and I\u2019ve got the mouth of a sailor. He finally settled down when he got to the front of the line. Now, it\u2019s one thing to yell at a manager, they expect that as part of their job, but it\u2019s a completely different story when you get ranty with a cashier. They say shit rolls downhill, and these poor people work in the crotch of two mountains. The pay is crap, the hours are terrible, and their employers have no respect or affection for them. You never, I repeat, NEVER, do anything to make these people\u2019s work lives any shittier than they already are. If anything, you should go out of your way to be the best customer they\u2019ve ever had.</p>\n<p>I guess someone forgot to impart that bit of wisdom to this \u201cgentleman\u201d, because even though he\u2019d already <small><del>verbally bitch slapped</del></small> lodged his complaint with the manager, he still felt compelled to <small><del>call the cashier a retard\u00a0 </del></small> vocalize his opinion at the register. To say the least, he was not polite.</p>\n<p>Now, like many of you, my gut reaction was to approach this man and chastise him about his rudeness. Actually, chastise isn\u2019t a strong enough verb. I wanted to teach him a lesson. I wanted to, boy did I want to, but I bit my tongue, and the reasoning behind my decision isn\u2019t actually very complex. What good would it do? None. Would he see the error of his ways and repent? Probably not. Would he get defensive, and possibly spew his hate all over me? Almost certainly.</p>\n<p>Also, I have no idea what his life is like. He could have had a terrible day. He may also have a thankless job, or a frustrating relationship, or maybe he\u2019s in physical pain. Anything could be contributing to his foul mood. It\u2019s not an excuse for him to treat other human beings with anything less than dignity and respect, but I certainly don\u2019t want to be someone that adds to his misery.</p>\n<p>So, I didn\u2019t approach him. I didn\u2019t sit back and do nothing, however, because I couldn\u2019t have lived with myself. I checked out, gathered my bags and waited patiently for #3 to finish his transaction and be on his way. At this point, I approached his cashier and offered her some kindness. I told her she was doing a great job, commended her on his patience and thanked her for her services.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t focus on the negative situation that had just passed, it happened, there was nothing I could do to change it. Instead, I focused on trying to make her day a little better.</p>\n<p>And that\u2019s really all we can do. We can\u2019t change other people, and we can\u2019t control how they act, we can only control ourselves. Imagine a world where everyone tried to make sure that everyone around them had good days. No need for grand gestures, no sweeping acts of generosity, just one simple act of kindness every day. It would certainly get our world one step closer to being a world of Peace and Love.</p>\n", "post_id": 1090, "location": false, "date": "03-13-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["emotion", "love", "cancer", "give", "age of aquarius", "universal", "idea", "currency", "gemini", "moral", "thanks", "selfishness", "alternative", "education", "employment", "fear", "happiness", "astrology", "gratitude", "selfish", "inheritance", "justice", "hate", "discussion", "alternate", "reality", "religion", "remorse", "economy", "greatness", "passion", "hope", "2012", "unemployment", "absolute truth", "compassion", "joy", "aquarius", "judgement", "protection", "imagine", "law", "security", "morality", "loss", "forum", "receive", "science", "foolishness", "conversation", "truth", "universe", "hatred", "balance", "greed", "generosity"], "text": "<p>It seems there is another contender for the Living in Love Award.

I prefer staying home to going out.  I prefer being alone to having company (with the exception of Hub).  When I do have to go out, I get angry because a lot of the people around me are just immature and aggravating.</p>\n<p>Yet, I do have to pick myself up and go out sometimes.  The store, the mall (when Hub drags me along to get new video games) or shopping with La Madre.  And when I do go out, despite my aggravation and that itch to be home working or writing, I am nice to (most) people.  I hold the doors for people, I pick up things that they knocked off shelves (dishing out a rude comment when they know they dropped it but refuse to pick it up) or clean up when someone spills something (like the idiot in Burger King who spilled her drink and then walked away.)  Some of it makes me feel good, other times I\u2019m just more annoyed at their lack of respect and consideration for other people that happen to live in their little bubble of a life.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, something happens\u2013something small, usually\u2013that makes me feel like I am a good person.  The only witness to these events is myself and the person on the receiving end of this kindness (although sometimes even they are not aware it was me, and I prefer to keep it that way.)  I don\u2019t like to draw attention to good deeds because I think it\u2019s a personal thing, something that will be acknowledged by the Universe in the form of kindness coming back my way\u2013besides, I don\u2019t want people thinking I\u2019m going soft or anything!!</p>\n<p>Anyway, something happened recently\u2013I don\u2019t remember when it was exactly or what else I bought that day, but I was at BJs with La Madre, one of those warehouse stores where everything is in bulk.  Need toilet paper or paper towels? 7,000 rolls in one package! Cereal?  Twelve boxes at once! Meat?  Buy the cow!  Okay, they\u2019re all exaggerations, but you get the idea.</p>\n<p>Point being, I go with La Madre everywhere she goes because it\u2019s awesome to hang out with her plus her health is not wonderful and I\u2019m terrified she might fall or someone will run into her into the store, or she\u2019ll have an accident while driving.  Among other things, she has a bad back.  She fractured it afterI asked for her help pulling something out of the car three years ago.  One more heavy lifting experience or a fall and she might be paralyzed.</p>\n<p>Again, that\u2019s not the point.  Let me get back on track here.  I was at BJs with her and we were in the water aisle.  They sell 32 bottles of water in one case.  It\u2019s kinda heavy, especially if you have a fractured back.  So, I was lifting it to put into her cart for her.  There was an elderly man next to me, pulling at a case of water.  He was by no means weak and probably would have had no problem lifting the case himself, but I was feeling good that day\u2026 and I already had the case in my hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cNeed a case?\u201d  I asked him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d  He asked, as if surprised that there was another human being on Earth who could be helpful nowadays.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you need a case of water?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, yes!\u201d  He was smiling.</p>\n<p>\u201cHere ya go,\u201d I said as I placed it gently in his cart (okay, actually it kinda just slipped out of my hands and fell in, but hey, it made it into the cart!)</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said, smiling at me.</p>\n<p>I then walked over and grabbed a case for La Madre.  \u201cThat was nice,\u201d she said.  She always acknowledges these things.  I just smiled.  Maybe it was nice, maybe it was kind, but I wasn\u2019t thinking of that when I did it.  I was just thinking \u2018this man could hurt himself.  He probably won\u2019t, but he might.  I\u2019m going to help him out. I\u2019m young and not that strong but if I get hurt, it\u2019ll heal.\u2019  No offense to the older generation, but sometimes injuries don\u2019t heal as well as they do in younger people.  So, I was thinking that it\u2019s no big deal if I sprain my wrist or hurt my back, at least someone else will be able to avoid the injury and go on with their lives.  Besides, he probably has grandchildren that want him to pick them up and I\u2019d hate to be the reason that couldn\u2019t happen if I just stood by and watched him do it himself.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m \u2018living in love\u2019;  carrying out my anger and bitterness probably doesn\u2019t help.  But I can say this:  when a person is in need, I help.  If someone is trying to reach something on the top shelf, it doesn\u2019t matter that I\u2019m only 5\u20192 and probably shorter than the person reaching, I\u2019ll climb those damn shelves to get it for them if they can\u2019t do it.  Or I\u2019ll use my mom\u2019s cane to smack it down.  (Yeah, I\u2019ve done that, and it was amusing for all involved.)</p>\n<p>If only everyone could be as kind as the many people on this Earth who don\u2019t hesitate to do a good deed once in a while.  Believe me, it feels great.

The fact of the matter is, I do not like the way WordPress is set up.</p>\n<p>I currently have just a little over 1,200 followers, here on WordPress.  The thing is, I am looking for the exact opposite.  I am not looking to meet followers.  I am not looking to secure followers.  I am not looking to associate myself with followers.  </p>\n<p>I am looking for leaders.  I am looking for 250,000 leaders.  Not 250,000 followers.  250,000 followers gains me nothing.  250,000 leaders, now that will equal a new world.</p>\n<p>I am looking for 250,000 people who are ready to stand up and say, YES!  I am a leader.  I am confident in my abilities.  I am perfection.  I am Love.  I am the answer.  I am the key.  I am the One.  Not because I am better than anyone else.  But because I have chosen to Live in Love.</p>\n<p>I am looking for 250,000 people that sicken at the thought of being followers.  I am looking for 250,000 people who have made a commitment.  A commitment to always do the right thing.  A commitment to take the time to analyze a situation in Love, before proceeding.  A commitment to be the better person, take the higher road.</p>\n<p>WordPress does not allow for a system of leaders.   I am looking to create a community of participants.  A community of Lovers.  A community of Leaders.</p>\n<p>I will not abandon this blog, as it has done so much good so far.  But I will find a way to get people over to my site.  It will involve posting your ideas.  It will involve getting you involved in the forums, in the comment threads, in the discussion.  And before long, WordPress will not be able to contain us.  We will have a massive library of ideas of Love, and how best to live within it.</p>\n<p>The Alternate Economy is about to enter a new phase.  One where we all become much more active.  I currently have 1,200 followers.  I will soon have 250,000 leaders.

skilled in graphic design, and have no experience in flash videos.\u00a0 But I really want this new website to look professional.\u00a0 I want it to appear like the sort of site you would be proud to associate yourself with.\u00a0 I know the content is worthy, but I feel my personal design skills are slightly lacking.\u00a0 With your help, I know I can make this website look and feel exactly as it

the Wave</a>.\u00a0 It is a comment on my post <a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.wordpress.com/2012/03/16/followers/\">&#8220;Followers&#8221;</a>, and I have to say it is spectacular.\u00a0 The points made are exactly the things I am constantly battling with.\u00a0 If anyone has read the book 1984, you know how important a word can be.\u00a0 I have made many attempts to define certain words that I feel are key to moving forward in Love.\u00a0 Alexander has done a great job pointing out the importance of a word and how it can totally frame your meaning, even if you are not intending it to.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Hi, Tristan \u2013</p>\n<p>Since the epoch of the leader-follower duality relationship is over \u2013 and also the requirement to define oneself as <em>either </em>a leader <em>or </em>a follower \u2013 I believe you may need a change of terms for your project. Also, since these terms, this relationship, has the tendency to trigger major emotional reactions on the part of most people, access deeply ingrained subconscious \u2018programs\u2019, I recommend ditching it as both an external and internal defining term. Besides, making simple black and white distinctions among people is not the most expansive, joyous, or empowering practice, is it? We are now leaving behind the world of limitation, so why give your \u2018followers\u2019 such an extremely limited (and polarized) choice to make? I mean, it brings to mind the old Shrub quote, <em>\u2018You\u2019re either with us, or you are against us.\u2019</em> Hmmm.</p>\n<p>I suggest, Tristan, that you switch to the much less challenging (and emotionally explosive) term of \u2018sovereign\u2019. A sovereign human being is definitely <em>not</em> a follower, but does not necessarily have to then be a \u2018leader\u2019 either. Many people refuse to allow themselves to be defined by either term \u2013 which you have now witnessed first-hand. I myself have no problem being labeled as a leader \u2013 but my personal self-esteem, and the life I have lived, is light-years beyond most people\u2019s, and can handle it. Most people have mid-to-low self-esteem, my friend, and so cannot abide being considered a \u2018leader\u2019, either by you or by themselves. The old religious programs (you are nothing, a <em>sinner</em> unworthy of anything good, only the very separate Old Guy With The White Beard On A Throne is anything, or the \u2018Savior\u2019, etc.) run deep, dude.</p>\n<p>However, to be a <strong>Sovereign Being</strong> is generally viewed as something very positive and, more importantly for your purposes, does NOT intrinsically imply a <em>set relationship</em> to other people, you see. A sovereign being, though continually acquiring information and learning via various sources, does not ever give their power away to those external sources. Their ultimate decision-making is left to their Self, who they retain as their Final Counsel. This is the most evolved way to lead one\u2019s life, as you know. Most sovereign people ARE leaders by virtue of their character \u2013 but are not <em>required to be</em>, either by others nor by themselves, as a way of defining \u2013 or limiting \u2013 their roles in social interactions. You see, by forcing your followers into an either/or decision on this matter, you have stirred up quite a lot of controversy \u2013 and many of those making comments are totally justified. It\u2019s not really fair, you see. More importantly for your obviously erudite mind, it\u2019s not really accurate either. By simply changing the terminology, you <em>completely </em>side-step (eliminate) the very disruptive and counterproductive emotional resistance/backlash that your leader/follower duality choice automatically triggers (in most people \u2013 you and I excepted, of course).</p>\n<p>You do not <em>really</em> want 250,000 \u2018leaders\u2019, Tristan. What you want is to work with 250,000 <em>SOVEREIGN, INDEPENDENT, SELF-ACTUALIZING SOULS</em> who may or may not be \u2018leaders\u2019 of others (or even themselves). Your goal is worthy, my friend, and notable. But it IS your goal that is most important, and not the details or definitions involved, right? When engaged in a battle between Life and fear, we must be pragmatic, and use whatever tools that <em><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">work</span>, </em>whether our petty little ego/personality/lower mind structures \u2018like\u2019 it or not. Right?</p>\n<p>To give more credence to this term, it was actually used by the original founders of democracy in the USA. It\u2019s in the Declaration of Independence, and the Constitution. It has a very specific legal, as well as personal, meaning. A true democracy (not in existence now anywhere) is <em>totally</em> dependent upon educated sovereign people to function correctly. This is documented fact. That\u2019s why the republic of the USA (it is actually NOT a democracy, not even legally speaking) no longer functions at all in reality.</p>\n<p>Anyway, picture this: 250,000 INDEPENDENT-THINKING, SOVEREIGN BEINGS working harmoniously together in mutual respect towards the common purpose of the further rapid empowerment and advancement of all of Humanity. No \u2018leaders\u2019, no \u2018followers\u2019, just equally ranked, cooperative and supportive individuals banded together in synchronistic focused activity. Tristan, groups of <em>less than a dozen</em> of these \u2018types\u2019 of people have changed the world! The history books (albeit horribly twisted in their accounts) are replete with stories of these very small, but VERY pivotal groups of like-minded, well-focused people. The Illuminati is just one that comes to mind.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><em>The Beginning Is </em></strong><strong><em><span style=\"text-decoration:line-through;\">Near</span></em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>HERE!</em></strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Alexander</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><em>\u201cWhat the caterpillar calls the end of the world, the Master calls a butterfly.\u201d</em></strong><em> </em><em>~ </em><em>Richard Bach.</em></p>\n", "post_id": 1137, "location": false, "date": "03-19-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["emotion", "love", "cancer", "give", "age of aquarius", "universal", "idea", "currency", "gemini", "moral", "thanks", "selfishness", "alternative", "education", "employment", "fear", "happiness", "astrology", "gratitude", "selfish", "inheritance", "justice", "hate", "discussion", "alternate", "reality", "religion", "remorse", "economy", "greatness", "passion", "hope", "2012", "unemployment", "absolute truth", "compassion", "joy", "aquarius", "judgement", "protection", "imagine", "law", "security", "morality", "loss", "forum", "receive", "science", "foolishness", "conversation", "truth", "universe", "hatred", "balance", "greed", "generosity"], "text": "<p>Thanks to Lou, for the blog <a href=\"http://talesfromthelou.wordpress.com/\">Tales from the Lou</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://talesfromthelou.wordpress.com/2012/03/19/greece-on-the-breadline-potato-movement-links-shoppers-and-farmers/\">Read the Original Post Here!</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"post-15020\">Greece on the breadline: \u2018potato movement\u2019 links shoppers and\u00a0farmers</h2>\n<p><strong> <img class=\"alignnone\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/3/18/1332083807669/Potato-sellers-in-Thessal-007.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>Greek customers buy potatoes direct from the farmers in Thessaloniki. Photograph: Sakis Mitrolidis/AFP/Getty Images</p>\n<p>There\u2019s some dispute about where and when it all started, but Christos Kamenides, genial professor of agricultural marketing at the University of Thessaloniki, is pretty confident he and his students have made sure it\u2019s not about to stop any time soon.</p>\n<p>What\u2019s sure is that the so-called potato movement, through which thousands of tonnes of potatoes and other agricultural produce \u2013 including, hopefully, next month, Easter lamb \u2013 are being sold directly to consumers by their producers, is taking off across Greece.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s because everyone benefits,\u201d said Kamenides, standing in a clearing in the woods above Thessaloniki in front of one 25-tonne truck of potatoes, another of onions, and smaller vans of rice and olives. \u201cConsumers gets good-quality food for a third of the price they would normally pay, and the producers get their money straight away.\u201d</p>\n<p>As devised by Kamenides and his students, it\u2019s a simple system. Their brainwave was to involve Greece\u2019s local municipalities, lending the movement a degree of both organisation and official encouragement that it might otherwise have lacked.</p>\n<p>So: a town hall announces a sale. Locals sign up for what they want to buy. The town hall then tells Kamenides the quantity required and he and his students call local farmers to see who can supply it. They show up with the requisite amount of produce at the appointed place and time, meet their consumers, and the deal is done.</p>\n<p>The direct sales are immensely popular. One organised last month by volunteers in Katerini, south of Thessaloniki, last month saw an online offer of 24 tonnes of potatoes sell out within four days, with 534 families pre-ordering.</p>\n<p>\u201cToday,\u201d said Kamenides, \u201cwe have one truck here, and two in another municipality up the road. Tomorrow we have a sale with four trucks \u2013 that\u2019s 100 tonnes of potatoes, straight from the producer to the consumer, with nobody in the middle pushing up prices.\u201d</p>\n<p>The movement, said Elisabet Tsitsopoulou, one of the women queuing up to buy, is \u201cextremely important. Salaries here are so low now, and still falling, but the price of everything seems to stay just as high as it ever was. This is much cheaper, much less than half price.\u201d<br />\nPotatoes</p>\n<div><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/69558396@N08/6388248059\" target=\"_blank\"><img title=\"Potatoes\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/farm7.static.flickr.com/6100/6388248059_d3d900a85d_m.jpg\" alt=\"Potatoes\" width=\"240\" height=\"179\" /></a></div>\n<p>Potatoes (Photo credit: robin.tobin)</p>\n<p>Tsitsopoulou bought five 25kg bags of potatoes for her family and her neighbours. \u201cThe other advantage,\u201d she said, \u201cis that you can see the quality and where the produce comes from. With supermarkets, you can never really be sure. It\u2019s just a brilliant system.\u201d</p>\n<p>The producers are equally delighted. Apostolos Kasapis said the principal benefit for him was that \u201cI get paid straight away. The profit is not very high, just a bit above the production cost, but I get the money immediately, which in this crisis is very important.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kasapis said wholesale buyers sometimes take \u201ca year to pay their suppliers. Sometimes, they don\u2019t pay at all. In my village alone, the farmers are owed more than \u20ac500,000. So for us, what satisfies us most with this system is that we have regained our power over the middlemen, who have been squeezing us and profiting unfairly from everyone now for years.\u201d</p>\n<p>The potatoes generally fetch 25-30 cents a kilo at direct sales, 5-10 cents more than cost and far cheaper than the 60-70 cents they typically sell for in supermarkets. If they have unsold produce sitting in barns and warehouses, farmers sometimes accept cost price; even that is better than the 10-12 cents routinely offered by wholesalers.</p>\n<p>Encouraged by the success of the movement, which has been enthusiastically taken up by local mayors, Kamenides said he was working on a broader scheme for unified co-operatives involving both producers and consumers.</p>\n<p>This could eventually provide a new economic model for the buying and selling of essential foodstuffs in Greece; several economists have suggested such schemes may prove an important way of breaking the \u201ccycle of crisis\u201d on which the country appears to have embarked.</p>\n<p>For the moment, though, the potato movement is typical of the new and inventive ways Greeks are finding to help themselves and each other in the country\u2019s fifth straight year of recession, with unemployment soaring to over 21% and more than half of all young people out of work. Even the minimum wage is about to be cut from \u20ac750 (about \u00a3620) a month to just \u20ac500.</p>\n<p>Few are immune from the effects. This weekend\u2019s sale above Thessaloniki drew a colleague of Kamenides, an associate professor of physics from the university. \u201cMy salary used to be \u20ac33,000 a year. Last year it was \u20ac22,000, with many more taxes to pay,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s a very big cut, and it\u2019s all the harder to deal with because your family budget is established over time; you take on commitments to match your income. If I can save \u20ac20 on two sacks of potatoes, that\u2019s worth having.\u201d</p>\n", "post_id": 1143, "location": false, "date": "03-19-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["emotion", "love", "cancer", "give", "age of aquarius", "universal", "idea", "currency", "gemini", "moral", "thanks", "selfishness", "alternative", "education", "employment", "fear", "happiness", "astrology", "gratitude", "selfish", "inheritance", "justice", "hate", "discussion", "alternate", "reality", "religion", "remorse", "economy", "greatness", "passion", "hope", "2012", "unemployment", "absolute truth", "compassion", "joy", "aquarius", "judgement", "protection", "imagine", "law", "security", "morality", "loss", "forum", "receive", "science", "foolishness", "conversation", "truth", "universe", "hatred", "balance", "greed", "generosity"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://alternate-economy.com/phpbb/\">Our Forum</a></p>\n<p>So, I have been working a lot on the website.\u00a0 Things are starting to come along.\u00a0 I am trying to set up a mirror site for WordPress, that allows you guys to create a free blog and post items for the Alternate Economy.\u00a0 I am having a few glitches, but I am sure I will figure it out soon enough.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, the new and improved forum site has been constructed and is fully operational.\u00a0 Now I just need some forum members&#8230;</p>\n<p>To encourage my new friends to move over to the forum on my site, I have written a new post, entitled &#8220;Ego&#8221;.\u00a0 Please, take a look below for the first portion of this essay.

It is the battle of the ego. Its battlefield the open stretches of our minds eye. The Individual marks their territory, sets up a defensive perimeter and hunkers down for the long haul, with their Pride as their only companion. But who is the enemy?</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alternate-economy.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=22\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/ts1.mm.bing.net/images/thumbnail.aspx?q=4944250855883068&amp;id=16fee6cdf657960782b81d65ef3dcea2\" class=\"alignnone\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<p>Ego has many negative connotations. People said to possess an ego are generally considered to be selfish, boastful, and even arrogant. It is true that this is a form of ego, but this is not the definition of ego. We all have an ego. We all have a sense of identity. We all share our feeling that we are separate and unique from other individuals. Our ego is what defines us. Not so much to others, but more in how we define ourselves to ourselves. Our ego can be and usually is expressed outwardly. If we feel we are shy and quiet around new people, then we express ourselves that way in public. Some might say this person has a very small ego, because they say little and do not take of the spotlight. But this would not be true. The shy individual has as great a sense of ego as any extravert. It is their incredibly strong feeling of individuality that keeps them on the sidelines. Through repeated assessments of themselves, they have made themselves nervous around new people. Instead of allowing themselves to feel and act naturally, they spend time second guessing their next statement. Their ego is one of self-doubt. But it is just as strong a presence in their life as an ego full of pride.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alternate-economy.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=22http://\">Continued in the Forums&#8230;</a></p>\n", "post_id": 1157, "location": false, "date": "03-20-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://alternate-economy.com/phpbb/index.php\">Forum</a></p>\n<p>There are all sorts of new stories and unseen posts on my forum site.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alternate-economy.com/phpbb/index.php\">Visit Now</a></p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not even going to tell you what they are entitled, but if you haven&#8217;t gone to check it out, you will never know what you are missing&#8230;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alternate-economy.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=23\">New Topics, posted by others!</a></p>\n", "post_id": 1164, "location": false, "date": "03-20-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>The third submission for the Living in Love Award comes from lmhpromotions.

I have always loved Valentines day, or any holiday or any day really that was different and fun. Who doesn\u2019t like wearing green and drinking green beer on St. Patricks, regardless of if you are Irish or even know why we celebrate it so enthusiastically here in America? Just like \u201cSpirit Days\u201d  in high school, these unofficial, cultural holidays should be fun and just another reason to celebrate life. So why is there so much negativity these days around Valentines Day?</p>\n<p>I remember when every kid in class got a Valentine, there were heart shaped cookies and candies involved and maybe you spent an whopping 15 minutes on a handmade card for that special someone you hoped noticed your extra effort. Now, if you don\u2019t have a romantic evening of roses, champagne, fancy dinner reservations and some jewelry in the mix somewhere you are supposed to feel bitter or unloved.</p>\n<p>Why?</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/screen-shot-2012-02-24-at-11-17-16-pm.png\"><img src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/screen-shot-2012-02-24-at-11-17-16-pm.png?w=300&#038;h=201\" alt=\"\" title=\"screen-shot-2012-02-24-at-11-17-16-pm\" width=\"300\" height=\"201\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1168\" /></a></p>\n<p>I can understand someone who is legitimately heartbroken over a lost love or recent romantic disappointment but why so much Anti Valentines energy going around?</p>\n<p>People should realize that the pressure comes from those evil marketing campaigns meant to make you feel like if you aren\u2019t buying or being bought what they are selling, you aren\u2019t in the club this year.</p>\n<p>I would like to take a stand and remind people that LOVE is not just meant for romance or for one person. Love begins with yourself and once you realize that, you will not need flowers or a box of chocolates to feel validated, you can fully enjoy roses or a box of chocolates courtesy of the person who loves you most, YOU.</p>\n<p>In addition to being our own Valentine, look around at ALL the potential Valentines you have all around you. The past few years I have enjoyed dressing in ridiculous pink outfits and passing out heart suckers to anyone I came in contact with through out the day, clients, people at the gas station, post office, friends and neighbors. I have found I felt happier and more full of love than if I was spending the day with only one special person.</p>\n<p>This past year I wanted to extend the bottomless love I have been experiencing lately with some of my neighbors who really need love. I coordinated with another inspiring community leader, Nadav Wilf,  President of Discover SD and a dear true friend to me and our friend Francine to become \u201cProject Cupid.\u201d We went through Downtown San Diego passing out Valentines candy, Starbucks coffee, water bottles, cupcakes and lunch bags with an assortment of supplies like hand sanitizer, chapstick, gloves and tooth brushes.</p>\n<p>We heard incredible stories of struggle, illness, families coming together or falling apart but most of all, gratitude. Everyone was polite, gracious, honest and in generally good spirits. If the group split up and I offered someone something they would say \u201cNo thank you, your friend already came by.\u201d  I was shocked. In all the hours I have spent passing free stuff out for promotions I have never experienced as much unselfish, grateful and polite behavior as I did this Valentines day. As Nadav\u2019s account described:</p>\n<p>\u201c I was really taken aback by how polite, thankful, but most of all how present they were. Each person had a story and genuine caring for one another and I felt really connected to them. It reinforced the notion that we are all one. We all want the same things out of life and in one way or another, we are all at times lost in our path to attaining love and happiness.\u201d</p>\n<p>As I sat on the train, writing this and reflecting on Love, a young man sat next to me and began reading over my shoulder. He asked what I was doing and I told him about my blog. He then pulled it up on his iphone and began asking me all about my travels and questions unrelated to my blog as well. At first I was giving short answers and trying to continue my flow of writing but he continued to interrupt me and I refrained from feeling annoyed but still didn\u2019t want to lose my concentration. He then asked if the words inscribed on the inside of my forearm were a tattoo. I stopped and looked at my arm, the fresh ink I just got yesterday and the raised words \u201cWhat Would Love Do?\u201d</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/2b7yj.jpg\"><img src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/2b7yj.jpg?w=300&#038;h=292\" alt=\"\" title=\"2b7yj\" width=\"300\" height=\"292\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1181\" /></a></p>\n<p>Here I am writing a blog about giving kindness and love to anyone and everyone and I was missing this opportunity to connect with the person next to me. We spent the next 15 minutes discussing his goals in life and how we both love our Grandmas and want to be there for them as much as possible. He got off at Fullerton to go visit his Grandma and help around the house and I was almost sad to see him go. I am confident in my decision to put those words permanently on the most visible part of my body to me. I always said I would never go above my ankles and joked I would probably end up with \u201csocks\u201d instead of \u201csleeves\u201d but this has already made a positive impact on my life and will forever remind me to Be Love. Besides being one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard, it is in Jason Mraz\u2019s handwriting from the love note he wrote me at Sundance. Now that\u2019s what I call Love.</p>\n<p>Happy Valentines day. Love to you.</p>\n<p>First, Be Love.

Everyone experiences love differently, I believe.  Some parents show their love by overly protecting their precious children.  Some parents show their love by leaving their kids in jail for a night when they screw up just to teach them a lesson (Hub learned that the hard way.)  Some parents make their children text or call them every time they get where they\u2019re going.  Other parents don\u2019t give a shit what their children do, but those aren\u2019t the kind of people I\u2019m talking about.</p>\n<p>Some girlfriends (or wives) show their love by leaving notes for their boyfriend (or husband.)  Some men send roses to their girls on their birthdays or Mother\u2019s Day (if they have children) or just randomly to show how much they care.  Some just give them cards with something special written inside (despite the obvious embarrassment they get from having done so.)</p>\n<p>Hub claims to not be sentimental.  \u201cI have memories,\u201d he says.  \u201cI don\u2019t need things to remember all the good times in my life.\u201d  While reorganizing our bedroom yesterday, I came across a small box Hub kept in his side of the bed.  Some papers were sticking out and getting destroyed, so I opened it to shove them back inside.  When I opened it, I realized the note on the top was a note I wrote for him when he started working at PetSmart with me while we were dating;  it wasn\u2019t a love note, it wasn\u2019t a list of things we were going to do when we started our life together as a married couple.  It was notes I wrote for him on how to operate the cash register because I knew there was a distinct possibility that the guy training him wouldn\u2019t train him correctly.  I wrote it out of love, and he saved it out of love.</p>\n<p>He gave me a card for our first anniversary\u2013he\u2019s not a card-giving type, and when he does give cards, he writes at the top the person he\u2019s giving it to and signs his name at the bottom, but he knows I love cards so he got me one.  The envelope is addressed to \u2018My Baby\u2019 and the front of the card reads:  \u201cHappy You and Me Day.\u201d  What he wrote inside is for my eyes only (get your minds out of the gutter, it\u2019s nothing like that!) but he did write something, and I cried reading it.  I recently came across it after celebrating our third anniversary (all of my cards staying in a box) and I put it in my purse.  Because whenever I need a pick-me-up, I read it, because mine and Hub\u2019s love for each other makes me happy.</p>\n<p>Whenever I do something stupid, which may or may not result in a minor injury, Hub laughs at me and says, \u2018Way to go, honey.\u2019  And I scowl at him and call him a dick.  But then we laugh together.  And he checks to make sure I\u2019m all right.</p>\n<p>When Hub and I were living in our first apartment and he was working a second job delivering pizza, he brought me home breadsticks one night.  There was a big hill that led from the stairs of the parking lot to our apartment.  He was carrying the breadsticks in one hand and his cell phone in another, calling me to let me know he was coming down the hill and to unlock the door.  I stepped onto the porch and watched him come down the hill.  \u201cI seeeeeee you,\u201d I said, smiling because my love was finally home. Then, he slipped.  Sideways.  Which I didn\u2019t think was possible.  I couldn\u2019t stop laughing.  Even now, as I write this, I can\u2019t stop laughing.  It was such a sight.  And through it all, he managed to keep the breadsticks in his hand and without them barely moving.</p>\n<p>Yesterday, while moving some old furniture out, we made another funny love-filled moment.  It was too heavy for me to help him with (I don\u2019t have the best back, even at 24) so he was trying to move it across the grass in a very\u2026awkward fashion.  I sat in our car on the backseats we had put down waiting for him so I could pull it in while he pushed.  But the whole time he was maneuvering this furniture across the grass and looking back at me to make sure he was on the right path to the car, I couldn\u2019t stop laughing at how funny he looked.  \u201cI hate you,\u201d he said, which only made me laugh harder.  \u201cYou\u2019re a dick,\u201d he said.  Again, more laughing.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, we lay in bed, surrounded by our new awesome furniture and fist-bumped at our immense coolness for having gotten so much done in one day.</p>\n<p>That, to me, is love.  Love is enjoying each other\u2019s company, making fun of each other, laughing at the other when one of us does something stupid.  And then cuddling up, talking about sports and who signed who, me getting him to read a funny blog or cartoon I found online, and him playing a song for me that he heard for the first time on the radio at work that day.  Playing Madden on our PS3 and him yelling \u201cHa! Take that!\u201d  when I fumble or throw an interception.  Him not calling when he leaves work because he wants to surprise me when he gets home, and getting mad at me when I come home from shopping and try to carry all the bags to the front door at once instead of asking him to come outside and help me.</p>\n<p>We don\u2019t lead the most exciting of lives.  We\u2019ve only been to a bar twice and both times was on our honeymoon (once was the bar in the hotel where he had our reception after all our guests had left and the second was because we wanted to go bowling but the lanes were closed so we figured we weren\u2019t going to make the drive for nothing, let\u2019s go to their bar.)  We\u2019ve gone to a few Yankees games and we\u2019ve gone to the movies bunches of times, most of the times with Bud and his girlfriend.  But the best times we have are the times where we\u2019re at home planning our future together, making our future the present, and enjoying each other\u2019s company.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s love.  If you don\u2019t have it in your life, go out and find it.  It doesn\u2019t have to be a significant other.  It could be a parent, a friend, a cousin, a sibling.  There\u2019s someone out there who loves you and someone you love.  Make memories with them.  Save mementos if you feel so inclined.  Don\u2019t spend hundreds of dollars for a romantic night out when one of the best romantic nights can be done at home, ordering Chinese or pizza and playing video games all night or doing whatever it is that you like to do with your loved one.</p>\n<p>And most of all, remember that you don\u2019t have to limit your love to one person.  Giving it out to more than one person does not diminish the love you have for the first person.  The more love you give, the more you receive.  And the best feeling in the world is giving and receiving love.</p>\n", "post_id": 1170, "location": false, "date": "03-21-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>The Fourth submission for the Living in Love Award comes from MindMindful.

This is particularly so when one of the persons involved is especially vulnerable. For example, I would NOT be so likely to intervene if two young men, who seem equally drunk, were swinging at each other. But \u2013 A young man on the ground being beaten by two other men: check. An elderly bag lady being harassed by a younger man on a darkened street: check. A woman being dragged out of a moving vehicle by an angry, intoxicated man: check. And, the day I witnessed a woman being strangled in a parking lot: oh, indeed! And I may have saved that one\u2019s life.</p>\n<p>Now, these are situations that even the armed police do not like to be involved in. With emotions so high, the possible use of intoxicants, the potential for weapons, &amp; desperation hovering, any kind of violent assault can escalate to killing in the blink of an eye. And, I suppose it\u2019s pretty much a given that the people involved, assaulter &amp; assaulted, are not really in control of themselves at that time. Anything could happen. And when it does, people become statistics.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/images9.jpg\"><img src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/images9.jpg?w=268&#038;h=188\" alt=\"\" title=\"images9\" width=\"268\" height=\"188\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1174\" /></a></p>\n<p>But I forget all that. I forget that I\u2019m petite, &amp; not very strong. I forget that the danger to the one who intervenes is very very high. I forget that I could die. I run into the fray, the righteous desire to be of help to the vulnerable surging through me &amp; I feel myself \u2018pumping up\u2019, much like the Hulk as he morphs from Ordinary Person to Super Hero. It\u2019s always been the case that I\u2019ve been able to command their attention somehow, usually muscling in between the people, &amp; the situation has devolved into something less-than-potentially-death-dealing. I think I catch them so much off guard, that a little moment is created where surprise, perhaps actual astonishment, stops the heated emotional content &amp; everyone is able to de-escalate.</p>\n<p>Afterwards, I am reduced to vigorous trembling &amp; dry heaves from the adrenaline that is still pumping. And, usually all the people involved in the violence just kind of move on &amp; go away. Well, I guess this is what they do; I\u2019m never really able to discern the details at that point. Still under the effects of the adrenaline, I think. When I do walk on, the lights are brighter, my stride is stronger; I know why people become adrenaline junkies.</p>\n<p>And further afterwards, I\u2019m always left with these two sets of thoughts \u2014 One is based in self-beratement \u2014&gt; I could have been killed! To put myself in such a situation \u2014 how stupid is THAT?!? And, the other is based in a sad sense of wonder \u2014&gt; how is it that no one else around (when there was someone) was willing to jump in &amp; help?!? ((Only one time was if different: When the soccer team I played on was coming out of a restaurant together after our game. At that time, several of them did also intervene.))</p>\n<p>I used to become angry with the others who may have witnessed a violent assault &amp; did not help, but I don\u2019t anymore. Can\u2019t blame them really \u2014 it IS completely counter to a rational sense of self-preservation to put oneself in harm\u2019s way, especially on behalf of a stranger. But I have an over-developed sense of The Golden Rule: I see most others, especially when they\u2019re in trouble, as my poor little self. And I know I would need help, in such a situation.</p>\n<p>So \u2014 these are acts of kindness, I guess. And they are assuredly random, as their appearance can\u2019t be predicted. It is my fervent wish that Love shall always pervade all our thoughts &amp; behaviors. When it doesn\u2019t, I will try to bring in one of those little moments of astonishment, to give time for Love to, hopefully, find its way back in.</p>\n", "post_id": 1173, "location": false, "date": "03-21-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>This post represents the fifth blogger in the running for the Living in Love Award.

Extreme Makeover Home Edition has been in my area all week; and, to kick-off their event, our local food bank had an EXTREME food drive that started January 20th and ended February 5th with a goal to collect 307, 000 pounds of food. In my mind I thought, \u201cwhat a beautiful way to promote kindness in the world. \u201d So my adventure started January 21st, when I picked up ten boxes to distribute to various locations. The initial responses were mixed depending with whom I spoke, but, I stayed passionate and positive. I was able to leave boxes with several people; however, it was the Dollar Tree in the Ctiy of Poquoson and C. Alton Lindsay Middle School of Hampton, Virginia that took this campaign to heart! I am extremely grateful for their efforts.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/dscn26881-300x225.jpg\"><img src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/dscn26881-300x225.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" alt=\"\" title=\"DSCN26881-300x225\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1178\" /></a></p>\n<p>On Sunday, January 30th, it was the perfect day to set out into my own neighborhood in Poquoson (Wilson Drive and Pasture Road) to collect non-perishable foods. It was crisp outside but not uncomfortably cold. I had my puppy-dog Sasha, my husband Rick and a green metal wagon in tote to set out, go door-to-door, meet my neighbors and collect goods. With high hopes I started next door. Ding-dong! We stirred my neighbors\u2019 cat as it jumped up into the front window and stared at us, but, it appeared no one was home. This did not discourage us. We set out to the next home, our neighbors, Elaine and Jim. They were absolutely wonderful.</p>\n<p>Elaine invited me into her home. I was able to chat with her husband Jim while Elaine went into her pantry to gather some non-perishable foods. It was such a beautiful, heart-warming time. That set the tone for my kindness adventure. Neighbor after neighbor on Wilson Drive and Pasture Road were so giving, sharing, generous and grateful to me to take the time to collect the food. WOW! Really?! GRATEFUL to me. I was and still am so grateful to my neighbors for sharing their food and time with me. It was an awesome experience of kindness.</p>\n<p>In retrospect, I was a bit nervous to do this. I had thoughts of what if I bother people or what if I offend people. Then, I looked deep down inside me, found that inner, innocent child, the one with the wide eyes of wonder and the willing heart. I channeled that willing heart, my inner child, to find the courage to say why not and just do it; and, I discovered, most adults cannot say no to an idealistic child. I was able to collect over 100 pounds of food that over-filled one box; and, with the combined efforts of the other 2 boxes in the other locations, it was a total effort of 152 pounds of food!!! We live in a beautiful world!!! </p>\n", "post_id": 1177, "location": false, "date": "03-21-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["economy", "sharing", "love", "compassion", "joy", "alternate", "peace", "giving", "culture", "conspiracy", "radio", "happiness", "thoughts", "trust", "technology", "change", "hope"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/radio.jpg\"><img src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/radio.jpg?w=300&#038;h=284\" alt=\"\" title=\"radio\" width=\"300\" height=\"284\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1192\" /></a></p>\n<p>So, I have finally figured out how to get this radio station working.

It\u2019s called Freecycle. I believe it is a group that runs across the country. If you haven\u2019t heard of it and you have a ton of shit lying around your house that you don\u2019t need, join this group. It\u2019s arranged by county, so I joined the group for Ocean County. People post things that they are looking for or giving away and others respond to give away or pick up their items.</p>\n<p>Donating to a charity or a thrift store is a great idea. But for me, someone who doesn\u2019t like to go outside much, I always felt like I was never sure if my items were going to good use and sometimes getting out is\u2026 difficult. Using Freecycle, I know crap I don\u2019t find useful anymore is going to be useful to someone else. I\u2019ve had the pleasure of giving away books, clothes, kitchen appliances and movies. I don\u2019t care if I could sell them somewhere for more\u2013or if the people who I give them to eventually sell them\u2013as long as someone gets a use out of things I can\u2019t use anymore.</p>\n<p>Not only have I gotten rid of a lot of stuff on Freecycle. I\u2019ve made a couple of friends. Just before Christmas, a woman contacted me about some hotel soaps I was giving away\u2013I had about three bags of them. I told her I had given the ones away that I had already, but my mom had some and I would pick them up from her to give to the woman. She was so grateful. I found out that she was using them to put into shoeboxes along with other items to give to needy children. I kept her e-mail address and told her I\u2019d contact her as it got closer to Christmas this year so I could give her more things that I collect throughout the year. Another woman I met I gave a Christmas sweater. She e-mailed me when she got home and told me it was the most beautiful sweater she\u2019d ever seen. I got teary when I read that, knowing that I made someone so happy to have said that.</p>\n<p>If everyone joined Freecycle and gave out their stuff they didn\u2019t want/need anymore, so many people would be helped, money would be saved, and I\u2019m sure there\u2019s something eco-friendly about it.</p>\n", "post_id": 1200, "location": false, "date": "03-24-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["emotion", "love", "cancer", "give", "age of aquarius", "universal", "idea", "currency", "gemini", "moral", "thanks", "selfishness", "alternative", "education", "employment", "fear", "happiness", "astrology", "gratitude", "selfish", "inheritance", "justice", "hate", "discussion", "alternate", "reality", "religion", "remorse", "economy", "universe More stats", "greatness", "passion", "hope", "2012", "unemployment", "absolute truth", "compassion", "joy", "aquarius", "judgement", "protection", "imagine", "law", "security", "morality", "loss", "forum", "receive", "science", "foolishness", "conversation", "truth", "hatred", "balance", "greed", "generosity"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/breakingfree1.jpg\"><img src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/breakingfree1.jpg?w=300&#038;h=180\" alt=\"\" title=\"breakingfree1\" width=\"300\" height=\"180\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1205\" /></a></p>\n<p>So far, one person has created a blog on the Alternate Economy Network.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alternate-economy.com/wordpress/les1lesley/\">SustainableUtopia</a></p>\n<p>Lesley&#8217;s blog features some great topics.

Well, you are thinking, so you fall under the category of \u2018thinkers\u2019. Thinkers are innovators, planners, observers, inventors, advisers, artists, and so on. These are the ones who think from every possible perspective, so precisely that they actually \u2018do\u2019 it in imagination. So, in a way, they think for the doers, so that the doers can do their tasks efficiently and safely. But the most important of all is the \u2018all-overs\u2019! These are the ones who first \u2018think\u2019 like thinkers\u2026..then \u2018do\u2019 like doers. They spend their time first \u2018thinking\u2019\u2026\u2026which includes a lot of careful observation, analysis, innovation, planning and practical feasibility. Then, they dedicate their time and energy to \u2018do\u2019 what they have planned. One of such lively example, which I see, is given by my friend \u201cTristan Nagler\u201d! I\u2019ve been reading his posts and I\u2019m very inspired by his actions. I noticed that he posted in a much planned way, on every possible topic you can think of! He first started the \u2018thinking\u2019 job; then he planned for his actions; and now he\u2019s finally implementing his actions and that too, quite successfully. He is from the category of \u2018all-overs\u2019, so rare to find today. To \u2018live in Love\u2019 is his tagline for the title of his life!</p>\n<p>We all can share some part of us with him. Whatever you believe you can do, just bring it out! If you believe you can give ideas because you categorize yourself under \u2018thinkers\u2019, then do it; go inspire people! If you believe you can \u2018do\u2019 something in accelerating his intentions and ideas, then do it; go lead people! If you believe you can also think &amp; plan and then implement it independently, then do it; go set an example! I\u2019m very impressed with Tristan\u2019s thoughts and actions and so I\u2019m dedicating this post to him. Currently, I can just do this!

"text": "<p>In our world today, evolution is presented as a random occurence which follows the rules of survival of the fittest.\u00a0 Evolution assumes, like all of science, that there is no consciousness involved.\u00a0 It is\u00a0simply random mutations that lead to complexity.</p>\n<p>Many people have a hard time with this idea.\u00a0 How could something as marvelous as the human being come from random reactions between atoms?\u00a0 The more I think about this, the more I wonder how this is possible.\u00a0 If our Universe is 12 billion\u00a0years old, give or take a million years, then how many chemical interactions have happened so far?</p>\n<p>In 12 billion years there have been 4,380 billion days, 10,512 billion hours, 63,072 billion minutes and 378,432 billion seconds.\u00a0 Most scientists agree that in an excited state atoms will react with one another about a billion times per second.\u00a0 Using this information it is safe to say that every atom in our Universe has reacted somewhere in the region of 3.7 x 10<sup>26 </sup>times.</p>\n<p>Now, let us look at our DNA.\u00a0 A human has 2.9 billion base pairs of\u00a0DNA in their genome.\u00a0 Each base pair is roughly 60 atoms in size.\u00a0 That means that a molecule of DNA is composed of roughly 174 billion atoms.\u00a0 There seem to be 118 different types of atoms in our Universe.\u00a0 For those 118 atoms to combine themselves in a way that would represent the DNA of a Human they must combine in a particular order.\u00a0 DNA is like a language, and if there is a typo, the meaning is lost.\u00a0 In order for a human to form, the atoms must arrange themselves in a way that is very precise.\u00a0 There is only 0.01% variation in the genetic code between different Humans.\u00a0 And this variation is still expressed as DNA.\u00a0 The number of actual atoms that\u00a0could change position is much smaller.\u00a0 The percentage of variation in the atomic order of a human being is 0.00000000000001%.\u00a0 So for the ease of this arguement, lets just assume that all humans are essentially composed of the same genetic code.</p>\n<p>The number of combinations of the 118 atoms that exist in this universe is quite astounding.\u00a0 Especially when the molecule in question is 174 billion atoms long.\u00a0 There are literally 3.217 x 10<sup>360,500,000,000 </sup>different combinations!\u00a0 For those of you that are not great with math, that number means that you have 3217 and then add 360,500,000,000 zero&#8217;s to the end of it.\u00a0 An absolutely massive number with no real way to imagine it!</p>\n<p>So, if we believe that evolution is random then we must agree that in the last 12 billion years an atom has had 3.7 x 10<sup>26 </sup>chances to become DNA.\u00a0 But there are 3.217 x 10<sup>360,500,000,000 </sup>different combinations of atoms that are not DNA.\u00a0 These numbers are not even similar.\u00a0 It would seem the chance of human\u00a0DNA arriving by randomness is almost an absurdity.</p>\n<p>3.217 x 10<sup>360,500,000,000\u00a0</sup>possible combinations of atoms to create a molecule of Human DNA.</p>\n<p>3.7 x 10<sup>26\u00a0</sup>possible\u00a0\u00a0number of reactions an atom can undergo in 12 billion years.\u00a0</p>\n<p>3 x 10<sup>23</sup> solar systems\u00a0in our Universe.</p>\n<p>1.33 x10<sup>54</sup> atoms per solar system.</p>\n<p>3.99 x 10<sup>77</sup> atoms in our Universe.\u00a0 Assuming each atom reacts the maximum number of times there will be</p>\n<p>1.48 x\u00a010<sup>104</sup>\u00a0possible reactions that could have occured in our Universe in the last 12 biliion years.</p>\n<p>So if we take the number of combinations of atoms that could be used to create a single molecule of DNA\u00a0and then divide it by\u00a0the number of possible reactions between all of the atoms in our Universe during the entire length of time that our Universe is known to have existed we can find the likelihood that a group of atoms would turn into Human DNA by chance.</p>\n<p>3.217 x 10<sup>360,500,000,000\u00a0</sup>possible combinations of atoms to create a molecule of Human DNA divided by 1.48 x\u00a010<sup>104</sup>\u00a0possible reactions in time gives us a 1 in 2.173 x 10<sup>360,499,999,895\u00a0</sup></p>\n<p>This means that a molecule of Human DNA has 1 chance in 273000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000&#8230;.. and onwards for another 359 billion zero&#8217;s or so.</p>\n<p>So, evolution through randomness simply could not have happened yet.\u00a0 There has not been enough time to even consider that this is a possibility.\u00a0 Evolution must have had some conscious driving force to help it arrive at the complexity it has in such an incredibly short amount of time.</p>\n<p>Or else we have been incredibly lucky.</p>\n", "post_id": 128, "location": false, "date": "12-22-2011", "mentions": [],

But how CAN we know which are the ones that we CAN and which are the ones that we CAN\u2019T? Though there<a href=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/can1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-1400\" title=\"can\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/can1.jpg?w=300&#038;h=375\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"375\" /></a> CAN be many explanations and answers that we CAN actually rely on, but which explanation CAN be generalized? Some people believe that each person is born with some talents and abilities; that means he CAN use his talents to do things that he CAN. But for the talents that he lacks, he CAN\u2019T perform the tasks that CAN be achieved by possession of those talents. Some people also believe that \u201cwhat we CAN\u201d and \u201cwhat we CAN\u2019T\u201d are predefined by the Creator Himself; according to which we CAN do things not that we actually desire but those<br />\nthat we are told to do or compelled to do! But this CAN\u2019T be true! CAN it be? How do you decide what abilities you must possess and what flaws you must ignore/reject? CAN you choose to select what abilities you want? Yes, you CAN! You CAN be the master of your own life. You CAN develop the talents your way, by just believing that<br />\nyou CAN. You CAN if you believe you CAN! This is the generalization. You don\u2019t just have to think about it, you actually have to believe! It\u2019s something from the inside. For all the things that you believed you CAN\u2019T do, just change your belief to \u201cyes, I CAN!\u201d<br />\nIt may not be that simple, but not difficult either. If we CAN do something, that becomes easy. But if we don\u2019t even try to do something by just thinking that it\u2019s difficult, it will be! For once, if you CAN think of it the other way, you CAN actually create something good out of it. If you CAN change your belief to \u201cwhat I thought earlier that I CAN\u2019T just because it was difficult for me, if now I believe that I CAN, it CAN certainly bring a change!\u201d then you surely CAN what you earlier believed you CAN\u2019T. The main point here is that you certainly CAN achieve what you truly believe. If you believe you CAN\u2019T because it seems difficult, then you CAN\u2019T. And if you believe you CAN do even the most difficult things, you really CAN. It\u2019s all a game of beliefs\u2026..your own beliefs! And beliefs are developed, defined, re-defined, modified, secured and lived. Beliefs are not something that CAN sprout instantly. It CAN\u2019T be instantaneous. It is a process; it takes time and energy. So now I ask, how many \u2018CAN\u2019? <strong>Remember, all of you CAN, you just have to believe!!</strong></p>\n", "post_id": 1346, "location": false, "date": "03-31-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Life", "receiving", "love", "forum", "generosity", "compassion", "joy", "philosophy", "alternatives", "giving", "suffering", "passion", "fear", "farming", "hope", "economy"], "text": "<p>Welcome to Our World of Judgment.  </p>\n<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='560' height='315' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZsNlcr4frs4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span>\n<p>The funny thing is that she is quite pitchy and nervous sounding.

Just to make sure that you are not making any wrong decision. But are you ever really wrong? I say NO. It is actually your own realization that makes you think you are wrong, but you are not! Let\u2019s take an example.<br />\nSuppose you have to make a decision between attending a friend\u2019s wedding and going on a trip with your family. Also, suppose that there\u2019s no alternative than to choose one out of these two optio<a href=\"http://varungenius.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/right-and-wrong-decisions1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image alignright\" src=\"https://varungenius.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/right-and-wrong-decisions1.jpg?w=410&#038;h=272\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"410\" height=\"272\" /></a>ns. Now, you start thinking\u2026\u2026a lot of thinking and ask questions to yourself, \u201cwhat if I go and enjoy with my family, but then my friend will be upset\u2026!\u201d or \u201cwhat if I go to my friend\u2019s wedding, but then I\u2019ll miss the fun trip with my family..!\u201d After all these self-questioning and long discussions, you finally come to a conclusion \u2013 a decision. Whatever it may be, but it is clear that you have to choose just one and skip or reject the other. But after making the decision, you start regretting for making that decision. Why? Weren\u2019t you aware of the fact that you have to choose just one and ignore the other? Yes, you were aware. This means you were WRONG even before making that decision. You knew that you are going to make wrong decision. But this is not true!<br />\nYou are WRONG when you THINK you are wrong! That\u2019s right! Our parents, society, elders and other people that we meet, keep us aware about things that are right and things that are wrong. But that is their perspective. How can you say that something that is right for one can be right for the other(s) too or something that is wrong for one can be wrong for the other(s) too! We all are different, unique personalities; we have different preferences, different likes and dislikes, different tastes, different perspectives, different opinions, different beliefs; then how can \u2018rights\u2019 and \u2018wrongs\u2019 be common to all? If your friend likes ice-cream, then it\u2019s not necessary that you like it too or you HAVE TO like it too. If being a \u2018non-vegetarian\u2019 is wrong for you, then it\u2019s not necessary that it\u2019s wrong for others too. If it were, then there would be no \u2018non-vegetarians\u2019. So, how will you know if you are wrong or right?<br />\nYou are right when you are TRUE and you are TRUE when you believe you are! When you make a decision on the basis of truth, you are right. Truth never hurts \u2013 neither you nor someone else; truth only gives you realization which is sometimes difficult to achieve or accept but not impossible. But when your decisions are based on excuses or lies, then you are WRONG. This is because we believe that making excuses or telling lies is WRONG; as it gives nothing other than more excuses or more lies. And anything that depends on excuses or lies must be wrong too. But what\u2019s more important is what you actually BELIEVE. If you believe that hurting someone with your decisions makes you wrong, then you are WRONG. But if you believe that every decision that you make will not hurt you or someone else, you are never wrong. <em><strong>Wrongness of a decision lies only in imagination to cover and mystify the truth that lies underneath. If you look deep within and try to uncover the imaginary layers of wrong beliefs, you will find TRUTH\u2026..which is always right!</strong></em><br />\nSo, ask yourself, \u201cCan I be wrong?\u201d If your beliefs are based on truth, you are never wrong\u2026otherwise you are!!!</p>\n<p>\u00a9Varun K.

I only ask because I must upload a photo for my profile, &amp; at first I found it very frustrating. Then &#8211; after a few mental tricks to get past that &#8211; I realized that IS the central issue &#8212; How does it appear? How do we recognize it? Does it change? And, hey &#8211; just what is &#8220;mindfulness&#8221; in the first place? What does it mean, &amp; -perhaps most importantly &#8211; why should anyone care?</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s extremely important to widen the gap between impulse and action; and that\u2019s exactly what mindfulness does. This is one of the big advantages of mindfulness practice: it gives us a moment or two, hopefully, where we can change our relationship to our experience, not be caught in it and swept away by impulse, but rather to see that there&#8217;s an opportunity to make a different, better choice. -Daniel Goleman</p>\n<p>This excerpt, from &#8220;Tricycle: the Buddhist Review&#8221;, <a href=\"http://www.tricycle.com\">www.tricycle.com</a>, makes the point quite well &#8211; &#8220;mindfulness&#8221; trains us to be able to recognize the chance to AVOID being caught up in our usual mental &amp; emotional habits, &amp; thereby creating the same kind of outcomes, mistakes, suffering as we have before. With a mindful mind we have the opportunity, &amp; hopefully will avail ourselves of it, to create a better world, for ourselves &amp; for everyone else.</p>\n<p>The Buddha said, &#8220;With our minds we create the world&#8221;. This is my heartfelt wish: With our ever-more mindful minds, let us together create the world we wish to live in.</p>\n<p>((PS &#8211; I still don&#8217;t know what &#8220;mindfulness&#8221; LOOKS like &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. any thoughts??))</p>\n", "post_id": 1376, "location": false, "date": "03-31-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["sister", "love", "mother", "girl", "true", "women"], "text": "<p>By <a href=\"http://varungenius.wordpress.com\">Varun Genius</a></p>\n<p>From the instant I entered this world<br />\nof disguise,<br />\nI\u2019ve been influenced by those \u2018true\u2019<br />\nglittering eyes,<br />\nIn the dark where I was blind of sight,<br />\nThere always appeared two stars of light,<br />\nLike the shower of rain, a fresh<br />\nmorning dew,<br />\nI see her eyes and find them always<br />\nnew,<br />\nA figure of LOVE, on the heavenly shelf,<br />\nA \u201cwoman\u201d is what she calls herself.

(Well, it might not be that apparent on my blog yet, as I&#8217;ve only just started it a couple months ago, but I am! I swear!)</div>\n<div>The problem is that a lot of people who don&#8217;t have a mental illness don&#8217;t understand it. They can&#8217;t fathom what it&#8217;s like to live with a disorder&#8211;any disorder&#8211;day in and day out for their entire lives. Let me try to explain it.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>My mother became sick when I was very young. She was bitten by a tick and contracted Lyme Disease when we moved into our new house in Bayville, New Jersey. I was only a year and a half old or so, so my recollection of it is kind of fuzzy. But I do remember some things. I remember she slept a lot. I remember she cried a lot. I remember it was six months before a doctor figured out what was wrong with her. Nowadays, it&#8217;s a known disease. A couple rounds of antibiotics and you&#8217;re cured. Back then, no one knew what it was. Every doctor told her she had the flu. That is, until her whole body went numb and she had no idea who or where she was. She was on an IV for the next few months. I don&#8217;t remember how long exactly, but it was a long time.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>She tells me she feels bad because I&#8217;ll never know her the way she used to be, before I was born. I tell her I feel bad because she once told me that after I was born, she was never the same. She didn&#8217;t mean it in a bad way, of course, and she regrets telling me now, but her brain isn&#8217;t the way it used to be.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>My point is (yes, I have a point. Sometimes it takes me a while to get there, but I always have a point) that her Lyme Disease is now chronic. There is no getting rid of it. It wasn&#8217;t caught in time. She reached the last stage. Well, second to last stage. The next stage was death. Every day she suffers from headaches, joint pain, memory loss. Every day it&#8217;s a struggle for her to even get out of bed. Sometimes she sleeps for weeks at a time. If you think that&#8217;s not possible, you haven&#8217;t met my mom. It comes on with no warning. She just can&#8217;t get out of bed one day. She tries, but there&#8217;s no fighting it anymore.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>It opened the door for a lot of chronic illnesses for her. She now has juvenile diabetes&#8211;yes, juvenile diabetes. Apparently, it can be brought on by excessive amounts of antibiotics, the doctors say, which is what she&#8217;s been on for the past twenty plus years because of her failed immune system resulting from the Lyme. She has asthma. She has COPD. We once went over the alphabet to see if she has a disease for every letter. She almost does. Three years ago she was diagnosed with a brain tumor. Now, it&#8217;s getting worse. She has problems with coordination, memory, mood swings&#8211;pretty much everything a brain tumor causes. She has a lump in her stomach, possibly this thing caused by the diabetes, which I can&#8217;t think of the name for, and she throws up almost every day. She can&#8217;t hold food down at all some days and survives off of pretzels and ginger ale, if she can hold that down at all.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Every day she lives with this. Not a lot of people understand what it&#8217;s like to be sick physically like this every day, but it&#8217;s the same thing for someone with a mental illness. Every day can be a struggle, especially if it goes untreated or mistreated.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>If you can&#8217;t understand it yet, think about a person with cancer, going through the struggle every day of having a tumor embedded somewhere in their body. Maybe surgery is too risky or not an option, maybe chemotherapy isn&#8217;t helping. Maybe it is helping, but the process is still dreadful. Consider a physically disabled person. Someone who spends their life in a wheelchair. Someone paralyzed from an accident. It&#8217;s a struggle every day, just like it is for someone with a mental illness.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Some people think mental illnesses are ridiculous. &#8220;Mood swings? Maybe it&#8217;s just her time of the month.&#8221; Very funny. And offensive. And I don&#8217;t get offended easily. Bipolar Disorder is not just a little unnecessary anger. It&#8217;s a real disease. It can be scary at times. And it&#8217;s not just anger. It can be sadness, or a number of other things. It can be confusing, uncontrollable.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>ADHD? &#8220;Well, maybe the subject is boring and that&#8217;s why you can&#8217;t pay attention.&#8221; Again, very funny. [Note the sarcasm, if you haven&#8217;t already.] And still offensive. I like to write. I like to collect stamps. I like to read. I like a wide array of things. But I can&#8217;t focus on any of them. I can&#8217;t stay focused on conversations with anyone. My mind is constantly running. Thoughts of what I have to do, who I have to call, are always spinning around. I can&#8217;t sleep at night. I lay awake thinking of things that have happened or could happen. Anxiety from it [or maybe separate from it] makes me cry, it makes my heart race. It makes me socially awkward. I can&#8217;t go outside unless I&#8217;m prepared. And by prepared, I mean that I have to open the door and look around to see if anyone&#8217;s around. If there is anyone around, I either wait for them to leave or spend ten minutes deciding what I&#8217;m going to say to them and planning responses to all possible questions they might ask. And whatever I say, I think about it for hours afterward wondering if I came across offensive or self-centered or mean or any combination of things. Then I wonder if I should apologize. Should I leave a note on their door? Should I knock on their door and tell them in person? Should I wait until I see them again? What if it&#8217;s not for two weeks? Is it too late to explain myself then? Do I even need to explain myself? And &#8217;round and &#8217;round the questions go.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>So the next time you want to make fun of someone for an illness they may suffer from, consider what it would be like for yourself. Consider what it would be like to have something that you have no control over. Before you wonder why someone seems odd, consider if they&#8217;re nervous or suffer from anxiety and perhaps don&#8217;t know what to say and don&#8217;t want to make a fool of themselves. Don&#8217;t judge them. You don&#8217;t have to make friends if you don&#8217;t want to, but be nice. It&#8217;ll come back to you in the end; that&#8217;s what karma is all about.</div>\n<p><a href=\"http://nowisthebeginning.wordpress.com/\">Now is the Beginning</a></p>\n", "post_id": 1383, "location": false, "date": "03-31-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["emotion", "love", "cancer", "give", "age of aquarius", "universal", "idea", "currency", "gemini", "moral", "thanks", "selfishness", "alternative", "education", "employment", "fear", "happiness", "astrology", "gratitude", "selfish", "inheritance", "justice", "hate", "discussion", "alternate", "reality", "religion", "remorse", "economy", "greatness", "passion", "hope", "2012", "unemployment", "absolute truth", "compassion", "joy", "aquarius", "judgement", "protection", "imagine", "law", "security", "morality", "loss", "forum", "receive", "science", "foolishness", "conversation", "truth", "universe", "hatred", "balance", "greed", "generosity"], "text": "<p> <a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/loneliness1.jpg\"><img src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/loneliness1.jpg?w=300&#038;h=240\" alt=\"\" title=\"loneliness1\" width=\"300\" height=\"240\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1394\" /></a></p>\n<p>In our world today we are motivated by a fear of being alone.  What greater sadness could there be than a life spent without a Loved one to share it with?  I have moved through many stages in my life.  I have rejected those around me for various reasons.  But what is the motivation for rejecting these people.  Could it be that I rejected them out of a fear of being alone?  It seems that in my life, the hardest part about Love is receiving it.  I like to claim that Love is easy, but where do I get this information from?  When we live in a spirit of loss, we enter a pattern of thought where Love is hard.  No matter what we do we seem to push Love away.  And in the end we find ourselves feeling alone.</p>\n<p>It is my fear that the majority of people alive today live in a spirit of loss.  They live in a world where Love is hard.  But what is it that makes Love so hard?  Is it a natural component to Love, or is it a variable that we have introduced?</p>\n<p>Loneliness may be the greatest fear in our current times.  Imagine if you were not thin enough to fit in.  Imagine if people didn&#8217;t like your laugh.  Imagine if you didn&#8217;t know what to say and everyone thinks you are a weirdo.  Imagine if you were told you are not good enough.  From an early age.  Imagine if a friend notices you have a big nose and giggles about it.  </p>\n<p>Why do we act in this way?  Why do we feel like we need to be perfect to be accepted by our peers?  Why do we feel we have a right to expect perfection from others?  Why do we really reject people?  Do we reject people because we don&#8217;t like them?  Or do we reject people because we are afraid that others don&#8217;t like them, and if we don&#8217;t reject them, we will end up being rejected&#8230;</p>\n<p>Of the girlfriends I have had in my life, I have ended the relationship with two of them.  The first one I ended it primarily because she was super in to me.  Her attention and demands on my time kind of freaked me out.  But more importantly, her attention and demands on my time freaked my friends out.  One friend in particular, who at the time would have been my best friend.  From the start my friend was not impressed with this new girlfriend.  It became time to choose.  It was obvious they would not get along, yet they both wanted to spend lots of time with me.  This would not do.  In the end, I had known my friend longer and so my loyalties lay with them.  A few jokes here, a couple of criticisms there and before you know it I had convinced myself that having someone shower you with Love and attention was not what I was looking for, and so I ended the relationship.  I rejected a potential Lover for fear of losing my current Love.</p>\n<p>The second time I ended a relationship with my girlfriend was primarily because she had moved to Toronto.  She lived 4 hours away, by car, and was starting at a new University.  I had been in this relationship before, however, and that time it didn&#8217;t end well.  That time she rejected me.  I was not interested in having my heart broken again.  I managed to convince myself that since it was still early in the relationship (only 3 month in) it would be better to bow out gracefully than wait for her to realize that she had met someone better in class.  I decided to beat her to it.  To end the relationship before she would have a chance to.  I rejected a potential Lover for fear that I would be rejected once she settled in to her new home.</p>\n<p>In both scenarios my rejection of another&#8217;s Love was motivated by a fear of being rejected myself.  I don&#8217;t want to be alone, so I push people away that might result in me ending up all alone.</p>\n<p>But where does this fear originate?  It is a fear that we are not worthy of belonging.  It is a fear that people will lose interest in us.  It is a fear that we don&#8217;t fit in.  It is a fear that we are not good enough to receive Love.</p>\n<p>This fear comes from the story we have written for ourselves.  It arrives from the pressures of a conformist society.  We want to be free to express ourselves, it is true.  But more than that, we want to be Loved.  And so we modify our expression of ourselves in order to improve our chances of being Loved.  We form strategies to ensure we maintain the Love around us.  But these strategies are based on fear.  They are based on a sense of worthlessness. Our strategies are coming from a spirit of loss.  We assume that we will lose Love if we do not present ourselves in a particular way.  But the horrible Truth is that what causes us to lose Love is in fact our attempts to secure it.</p>\n<p>The Truth is that Love is created.  But it requires that all parties participate in its creation.  It cannot be created by only one person.  It takes two to tango.  Love is not bargained for, or won, or earned.  Love is a decision.  It is a commitment.  It is a choice.  Love is meant to shared with everyone, created with all.  It is not meant to be exclusive.  We are not meant to choose between Lovers.  We are meant to incorporate another into our Loving arms.  We are meant to create a bond with our new Love and share that bond with our current Love.  We are meant to bring other Lovers together and celebrate in their success.</p>\n<p>As long as we fear rejection, we will act in a way to push Love away.  We will categorize potential Lovers to see if they fit our definition of a potential partner.  The Truth is everyone is a potential partner.  We are all looking for the same thing; Love.  It can be created with anyone.  Love truly is easy.  All it takes is two people willing to try.</p>\n<p>When we fear rejection we see ourselves as always being on the brink of loneliness.  Or we find ourselves truly alone.  But this is never the case.  We are never actually alone.  There is always someone, maybe someone you least expect, who longs for your acceptance.  Someone who thinks of you before bed at night.  As we begin to live in a Spirit of Receiving we begin to see that this list is larger than we expected.  It isn&#8217;t just one person that Loves us.  Even if we are without a partner, Love can be found in many other places.</p>\n<p>A spirit of receiving is realizing that we do not need to act in a particular way to be Loved.  We are already Loved, just for who we are.  And the trick to receiving more Love in the future is simply to create it.  Not with some people, but with everyone.  Go out and create it.  Open a door for someone, take your friends hand in yours, tell someone how happy they make you feel.</p>\n<p>Love is not hard.  It is not even uncommon.  It is our sense of self, our wounded stories, that cause us to fear rejection.  We do not want to be alone.  But the funny thing is we are never alone.

Please check out Diabetic Redemption, for her first submission.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://diabeticredemption.com/2012/03/23/love-is/\">Love Is&#8230;</a></p>\n<p>I receive a daily inspirational email from Neale Donald Walsh, whose website is Conversations with God.  Today\u2019s says On this day of your life, Judith, I believe God wants you to know:</p>\n<p>\u2026that love is not what you want, it is what you are. It is very important to not get these two confused.</p>\n<p>As these emails sometimes do, this one struck a chord with me.  I have wanted love my entire life:  first from my parents, and then from anyone I thought might love me.  This, as I look back on it, is awfully sad.  And, of course, I was sad right along with it.  He goes on to say:</p>\n<p>If you think that love is what you want, you will go searching all over the place.  If you think love is what you are, you will go sharing it all over the place. The second approach will cause you to find what the searching will  never reveal.</p>\n<p>What a concept!  If I had read this 5 years ago, I would have thought this guy was out of his mind.  In fact, I wouldn\u2019t have understood what he was saying.  And I looked for love everywhere I could think of \u2014 many times in the most very wrong places: in bars, among my congregation, among other students at school and college.  I even met a dry drunk in a clean and sober club, and I ended up marrying him.  After 15 years of this, you would think I\u2019d have learned.</p>\n<p>I found plenty of sex.  Oh, yes.  Most of it not too smart, either.  Considering the number of one-night-stands I orchestrated during those years, I find it a flat-out miracle that I\u2019m not long dead from HIV/AIDS, or permanently scarred by some other awful condition.  And every time I had sex with someone I didn\u2019t love, or who didn\u2019t love me, I was further cementing the idea that I wasn\u2019t worth anything, and that I\u2019d never find love.</p>\n<p>I have heard people say, dozens of times, that \u201cyou can\u2019t love anyone else until you love yourself.\u201d  I loved everyone but myself.  And I couldn\u2019t make anyone love me. Unrequited love was my best event, as they say in sports.  Until last year, when the light sparked on, and I understood.  Not as much about finding someone to love, as loving myself.  My entire life suddenly made an awful kind of sense, and I had some time forgiving myself.  But it worked.</p>\n<p>So now, I live love.  At least most of the time; I still need to work on gossip.  But I exist in this beautiful bubble of love, and it affects everything that I say, do, write.  And I\u2019m not looking for love from anyone in particular.  So I am surrounded by people who love me, just because that is the way I live.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m no longer searching for love.  And that decision allowed me to find it.  Finally.  Thank goodness.</p>\n", "post_id": 1402, "location": false, "date": "04-01-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["belonging", "love", "generosity", "compassion", "joy", "create", "peace", "Life", "community", "imagination", "utopia", "passion", "together", "freedom", "positivity", "receiving", "humanity", "happiness", "hope"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/generosity-color.jpg\"><img src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/generosity-color.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" alt=\"\" title=\"Generosity Logo\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1410\" /></a></p>\n<p>I find it quite interesting the trends that I see while browsing certain tag threads on the WordPress site.  I like to follow certain tags in order to see who is posting about certain topics.  Because I am interested in the idea of Love, I follow the tags Love, Joy, Hope, Passion, Compassion, Generosity and Receiving, among others.  I can&#8217;t help but notice that these 7 topics receive a very large range of posts per day.  I imagine that the average number of posts with certain tags is a good indicator of how present a thought is in the &#8220;collective consciousness&#8221;.  Some threads get literally thousands of posts per day, like family and art and photography.  Here is how the words associated with Love fare.</p>\n<p>Love receives approximately 45 posts per hour or 1000 posts per day.</p>\n<p>Joy receives approximately 5 posts per hour or 120 posts per day.</p>\n<p>Hope also receives approximately 5 posts per hour or 120 posts per day.</p>\n<p>Passion receives approximately 4 posts per hour or 100 posts per day.</p>\n<p>Compassion receives approximately 3 posts per hour or 75 posts per day.</p>\n<p>Generosity receives approximately 7 or 8 posts per day.  Yesterday, of the 7 posts on generosity that appeared in the thread, 3 originated from this blog. </p>\n<p>Receiving receives approximately 1 post per day.</p>\n<p>It seems we do not truly understand the components to Love.  We are all searching for Love, but beyond Hope and Joy, and maybe a little passion and compassion, we really seem to be lacking in our ability to give and receive Love.  It is time to embrace Generosity.  It is time to embrace a Spirit of Receiving.  Even I do not use the tag Receiving in my posts&#8230;</p>\n<p>It is time to change the collective consciousness.  It starts one blog at a time.</p>\n<p>What will you tag with Generosity and Receiving today?</p>\n", "post_id": 1409, "location": false, "date": "04-01-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["belonging", "love", "generosity", "compassion", "joy", "create", "peace", "Life", "community", "imagination", "utopia", "passion", "together", "freedom", "positivity", "receiving", "humanity", "happiness", "hope"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/loveaward1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1201\" title=\"loveaward\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/loveaward1.jpg?w=300&#038;h=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<p>Congratulations to <a href=\"http://mindmindful.wordpress.com/\">MindMindful</a>, the second recipient of the Living in Love Award!

Can someone really own a forest? How does one claim ownership of that forest? Does that make the animals in the forest yours? What about the birds that only come for part of the year. Are they yours as well? Will you build a fence around it to keep what is yours in? Will you stay up nights thinking about how best to guard it?</p>\n<p>What about a diamond? What do we gain when we own a diamond? We have a new rock. We are able to show it off to others. But we know of their greed, and so we must secure our diamond somewhere safe when we cannot watch it. What does owning this diamond bring us? Health? Does it fill our bellies, or enlighten our soul?</p>\n<p>Now, think of owning a home. First of all, how many people even have the opportunity to purchase a home? And of those people, how many actually own their property, with no strings attached? In my experience, it is usually the Bank that owns our homes. And how is owning a home any more real than owning a forest? When we buy our home, we also take on all the responsibilities of being a homeowner. There is maintenance, heating in the winter, making improvements and cleaning. Not to mention the occasional disaster. What is it we own? Does buying a home bring us peace of mind? Would buying a forest, or a diamond\u2026</p>\n<p>Daring to Live in Love is realizing that we live in an Economy of Greed. Our society follows a set of rules. These rules all center around the idea of ownership. From marriage to grand theft auto, almost all laws pertain to ownership in some way. We define ourselves by our possessions. We are what we own. Maybe we don\u2019t own our husband. But no one else can have him. It says so on paper.</p>\n<p>When we begin to Live in Love we see that ownership is meaningless. Ownership implies control. We wish to possess things so that we may control them. \u201cIt is mine and nobody else can have it, unless I say so.\u201d That is the root of possessions. When we begin to Live in Love we see that possessions are meaningless. You cannot control anything. Certainly not another person. Nature doesn\u2019t often co-operate either. So what is it we are trying to control? What is it we desperately need to possess?</p>\n<p>Love. That is all anyone is really looking for. But what is Love?</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://nowisthebeginning.wordpress.com/2012/03/26/guest-post-from-tristan-nagler/\">Continued&#8230; Full Text Here</a></p>\n", "post_id": 1416, "location": false, "date": "04-01-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["duty", "love", "god", "serve", "parents", "hands", "respect", "care"], "text": "<p>By <a href=\"http://varungenius.wordpress.com\">Varun Genius</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/hands.jpg\"><img src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/hands.jpg?w=300&#038;h=300\" alt=\"\" title=\"hands\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1442\" /></a></p>\n<p>The words you are going to read<br />\ncome straight from my heart. It<br />\nrequired no thinking; it sprouted up<br />\ninstantaneously in my mind. It\u2019s about<br />\nPARENTS. We all love our parents and<br />\nare always thankful to them. Aren\u2019t we? Doesn\u2019t matter what situations we<br />\nhave been through, we always end up<br />\nin drawing ourselves towards them.<br />\nThere\u2019s something that never lets this<br />\nbond tear apart; not even a little. It\u2019s<br />\nsomething more than a relation; the word \u2018relation\u2019 can\u2019t define its true<br />\nnature. There may be times when we<br />\nhurt them intentionally or<br />\nunintentionally. But have you ever<br />\nnoticed that when we hurt them, it<br />\ndisturbs us, not them. They are always ready to accept; even our unexpected<br />\nwords and our undesirable actions.<br />\nHave you ever wondered that no<br />\nmatter how your parents have been in<br />\ncharacter in their young ages; they are<br />\nalways kind and caring when they become PARENTS! What brings so<br />\nmuch change? Do you think it is<br />\nbecause they think it is customary to<br />\nlove and take care of their children?<br />\nDo you think they fear GOD\u2019s wrath<br />\nand are compelled to be so? Do you think they consider their affection and<br />\ncare as \u2018duties\u2019 to be performed or<br />\n\u2018rituals\u2019 to be followed to keep GOD<br />\nhappy? Can you really ever know<br />\nwhat they actually think about you?<br />\nMost of you must have been haunted by such questions at some point of<br />\nyour life. But the main question is,<br />\n\u201cwhy is there a need to know if you<br />\nalready get what you really want from<br />\nthem?\u201d \u2013 Love! \u201cOur parents are always supportive,<br />\nloving and caring!\u201d Not all of you<br />\nbelieve that, do you? Most of you<br />\nmight have experienced otherwise.<br />\nThere may be many instances when<br />\nyou feel that your parents always deny your actions, your ideas, your<br />\nwords and even your beliefs. You may<br />\nfeel that they are always trying to<br />\n\u2018restrict\u2019 you, to bind you in chains. But<br />\nthere\u2019s something that you don\u2019t<br />\nknow and which I\u2019m going to tell you now! In general, the term \u2018parent\u2019 refers to an individual who takes<br />\nproper care of her young ones by<br />\nnourishing them, protecting them<br />\nfrom harm, and teaching them the<br />\ngood things that they themselves<br />\nhave experienced in their lives . That\u2019s just a general definition; and<br />\ndefinitions are just definitions unless<br />\nthey are interpreted into some<br />\nmeaningful words that have some<br />\nsignificance in our lives. So, here\u2019s my<br />\ninterpretation! \u201cParents are hands of GOD\u201d. What do we do with our hands? We can do innumerable tasks with our<br />\nhands. We can write, climb, grasp,<br />\nhold, lift, eat, manipulate, express,<br />\nhelp, scold, slap, clap, appreciate,<br />\nfetch, and do so many things with our<br />\nhands. Now read my interpretation and see what relation you can make of<br />\nit. If parents are hands of GOD, then: PARENTS write our fate, PARENTS make<br />\nus climb and reach the heights,<br />\nPARENTS teach us to grasp good<br />\nthoughts, PARENTS hold our hands<br />\nwhen we are about to fall, PARENTS lift<br />\nus up when we are down, PARENTS feed us with their love, PARENTS<br />\nmanipulate (guide) us so that we are<br />\nproceeding in the right direction,<br />\nPARENTS express their emotions for<br />\nus, PARENTS help us at every step of<br />\nour life, PARENTS scold us when we are wrong, PARENTS slap us when we<br />\ncross the limits, PARENTS clap for us<br />\nwhen we perform well, PARENTS<br />\nappreciate us when we show our<br />\nuniqueness, PARENTS find us<br />\nwherever we are! So, if parents are hands of GOD, then it<br />\nmust be \u2018us\u2019 who are wrong<br />\nsomewhere in believing otherwise.<br />\nThe Creator knows the absolute truth;<br />\nwhat\u2019s wrong and what\u2019s right! He<br />\nuses his hands for moulding His children into something that He truly<br />\ndesires. PARENTS are hands of GOD;<br />\nthey mould us into a shape so unique<br />\nfrom others but original in character.<br />\nDoesn\u2019t matter what character we<br />\npossess, we are always loved by our parents the same way as everyone<br />\nelse is! There is a fundamental energy<br />\nthat makes us \u2018realize\u2019 and \u2018aware\u2019 of<br />\nour kindness when we become<br />\nparents. This fundamental energy is<br />\nthe Creator Himself. He is the one who, through his \u2018hands\u2019, shapes us into<br />\nreality; the same way we create things<br />\nwith our hands. So, next time you think that that you<br />\nare being \u2018restricted\u2019 by your parents,<br />\nthat means you are actually trying to<br />\nbreak a bond that is unbreakable.<br />\nEvery time you consider their<br />\n\u2018guidance\u2019 or their \u2018decision\u2019 as \u2018restriction\u2019, that means you are<br />\nleaving the hands of GOD and in doing<br />\nsuch you can\u2019t become anything; not<br />\neven a HUMAN. But this doesn\u2019t mean that parents are<br />\nalways right in making decisions for<br />\nus. They can be wrong too! But as<br />\ntheir children, as a family, don\u2019t you<br />\nthink it is our duty to tell them what<br />\nwe actually feel. A family lives happy when we all express ourselves with<br />\nhonesty. If you express yourself, your<br />\nparents will know your every desire<br />\nand they will give their best to make<br />\nyou achieve the same. This is exactly<br />\nwhat our own hands do! Isn\u2019t it? When we wish for something, we use<br />\nour hands to act in the direction of<br />\nachieving it, and finally we grasp it!<br />\nSimilarly, our parents\u2019 guide us in the<br />\ndirection of achieving our dreams/<br />\ndesires and help us grasp the same. Always wish that the hands of GOD<br />\nstay on your shoulders to guide<br />\nyou, to love you and to shape you<br />\ninto originality!</p>\n", "post_id": 1424, "location": false, "date": "04-03-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["belonging", "love", "generosity", "compassion", "joy", "create", "peace", "Life", "community", "imagination", "utopia", "passion", "together", "freedom", "positivity", "receiving", "humanity", "happiness", "hope"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/8923_258928685150_661575150_8870557_6073351_n.jpg\"><img src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/8923_258928685150_661575150_8870557_6073351_n.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200\" alt=\"\" title=\"8923_258928685150_661575150_8870557_6073351_n\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1427\" /></a></p>\n<p>Another submission for the Living in Love Award! There are now 4 bloggers in the running for this award, and two finalists. The newest submission comes again from Sustainable Utopia. The second step to earning the Award is Defining Love for your readers and blogging about it. Please check out Lesley&#8217;s blog, for her second submission.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alternate-economy.com/wordpress/les1lesley/2012/03/31/i-love-you/\">I Love You!</a></p>\n<p>There! I said it, and it wasn\u2019t as hard as I thought it would be.<br />\nBut, wait a second, why did I assume it would be hard? What has happened in human history that has made it so difficult to say those three little words?<br />\nThink about it for a second. How many times a day do you actually say these words to yourself or another person? Some people, if they\u2019re lucky, probably a handful of times. Most people, maybe only once or twice. There are also far too many people out there who neither say it, nor hear it in their daily lives. And that\u2019s NORMAL!  So normal, in fact, that just the mere thought of saying it outside of a daily ritual can make someone with nerves of steel as anxious as a gazelle in a lion\u2019s den.<br />\nHow did \u201cI Love You\u201d become scary?<br />\nI\u2019ve noticed that \u201cI Love You\u2019s\u201d come in two categories; 1) I Love You\u2019s said  ritualistically that the words become almost meaningless, and 2)I Love You\u2019s said so infrequently, that when they are said they make the sayer look crazy.<br />\nIn the first category, the Ritual \u201cI Love You\u201d, it is often exchanged as more of a greeting or departing statement than a declaration of affection. Good morning, \u201cI Love You\u201d. Good bye, \u201cI Love You\u201d. Have a good day, \u201cI Love You\u201d, See you tomorrow, \u201cI Love You\u201d. None of these are bad, but they\u2019re habit. The words are said and heard so often that they lose their importance. People begin to feel under-appreciated, no matter how often they hear the phrase, because the actions that would confirm the \u201cI Love You\u201d are often neglected.<br />\nI think to avoid falling into the \u201cI Love You\u201d rut, we should try to make an effort to be aware of when we\u2019re saying the words, and always try to follow them up with an action of some kind. Oh, I just said it, I should go give a hug as well. We could also make telling someone you love why you love them a priority as well. You\u2019re kind, and generous and you always make me smile, I Love You. The whole point of telling someone you love them is, after all, to convey how important they are to you. When the words become mundane, we should all strive to give them back the importance they deserve.<br />\nThe second category of \u201cI Love You\u201d is the one that has me the most baffled. It\u2019s the why-did-this-person-just-tell-me-this \u201cI Love You\u201d. You all know what I\u2019m talking about. It\u2019s the reason we tell people we \u201cheart\u201d them, or that we \u201cLuv\u201d them. It\u2019s so that they don\u2019t think we\u2019re nuts and mushy, or, gasp, In Love with them. When did we become ashamed of our feelings? Why is it considered embarrassing to Love your friends? Okay, that may be taking it a bit far. We are definitely expected to love our friends, but we can only tell them that we do at special events like weddings and funerals.<br />\nI want to tell people  I Love them. I don\u2019t want to feel shy about it, or self-conscious. I don\u2019t want to worry about making my husband jealous because I happen to Love a male friend. Just because I love my husband, does not mean I can\u2019t Love my friend. It doesn\u2019t mean I Love one more or less than the other, it means I Love them both. I\u2019m not making room for more than one in my heart, I\u2019m letting my heart grow bigger to accommodate everyone.<br />\nI want to be able to tell my male friends that I Love them without worrying that they think I\u2019m \u201cIn Love\u201d with them. I\u2019d like to be able to tell my female friends that I Love them without the inevitable innuendos.  I don\u2019t want to tip toe around my feelings because they make others uncomfortable. I don\u2019t want other people to be uncomfortable about my feelings. I don\u2019t even particularly care if they return the sentiment. I just want to tell them.

This is the reason some of you are here, and this is your purpose at this time. If you feel you are being called to the forefront of your people, then we say to you this is your call and you are hearing it loud and clear. We say to you, follow this beacon that will lead you to a destination that will see you taking charge of situations and assisting your brothers and sisters to make it through these days ahead with grace and confidence that they will make it through these events safely, seeing no harm come to them or their families who have trusted your leadership and have been inspired by your wisdom, your courage and your understanding of these events. </p>\n<p>What you are being asked to do is to relive the events that have transpired here in the distant past, but this time you will gather all your resources, including each other, to assist you better handle these challenges and rise to the occasion, defeating any obstacle that presents itself in your path. You are being asked to face these challenges with courage and determination and a will to survive. What you are not being asked to do is to panic, to fear, to turn on each other, to quit, to feel sorry for yourselves and to allow these challenging events to overpower you and defeat you. </p>\n<p>You all have gone through so much through your many incarnations into the physical, and all of these experiences have been stored within your subconscious as tools in your arsenal to allow you to better face the adversities of the period that you are in at this very moment. All of these past lives and all of these experiences were very important and for a reason, and that reason is now. You may view your past lives as your training ground to hone your skills that you will need to make it through the months ahead according to your terms, according to your vision of how you wish to experience your existence. You make the rules, you call the shots. You have the power and the means to experience the days ahead the way you wish to, and we ask you, do you have the determination, do you have the will, and do you have the courage to make it through these days ahead the way you wish to.</p>\n<p>There will be many from this day forward who will choose many different paths of experience, and you will be required to make a decision as to whether you choose to be a follower or a leader. Many paths will present themselves, and many of those among you who will present themselves as leaders down these paths, but remember, there will be many leaders and many paths and not all of them will lead you through smooth roads and clear skies. It is up to you and no one else to choose if you wish to lead, if you wish to follow, and which path you will walk from this moment forward. There will be \u2018false prophets\u2019 who beg you to follow their Sirens call, and they will lead you down a path of destruction. Who is it that you are following? Why is it you are following this person? Why do you resonate with their preaching? Where will the path they are leading you down emerge?</p>\n<p>It is time to reveal to you more of your purpose here, and the time has come for you to understand better your choices as the days are numbered and they grow shorter every moment. The days and months will pass by you very quickly and it will be soon that important choices present themselves to you, and it is of most importance for you to accurately recognize them and consciously realize that a choice is being offered you and that you must choose. There will be no way to move forward without choosing a path, and not choosing will result in you traveling down one of these paths whether you consciously made this decision or not. </p>\n<p>As we have advised you all along, there is nothing to fear. This does not mean you cannot choose fear as one of your paths. All along all of your journeys you have always had the option of choosing the path of fear, or choosing the path of love. This is no different today, and will be no different tomorrow. You may if you wish, consciously choose each path presented to you based on these two differing emotions. We will not persuade you to choose either of these paths. You do not need our coaching any longer in this regard. Each of you by now understands, at least superficially, the differences between these two emotions and the qualities and traits that each of these paths will bring to your experience. Recognizing the differences between a path of fear and a path of love should come naturally to you. Which is the path that makes you feel good, makes you feel safe and secure, makes you feel loved, makes you feel confident, makes you feel empowered, and which is the path that instills you with fear, of emptiness, of insecurity, of uncertainty, of danger? </p>\n<p>We will not point you in either direction down any of the paths presented before you as this is not why we are here, and it is not our right to influence you in this way. We are here to assist you in many ways, but we are not here to convince you how to proceed through your journey. We will offer you choices of our own, but you maintain the right to either accept or decline our assistance. No one will ever force anything upon you, and if they do, then you may immediately recognize this energy as either love or fear, light or dark. Some of what we offer you will benefit those of you who choose to proceed through the following days safely, seeing no harm come to them or their families, but again, it is your choice whether to accept these offerings.</p>\n<p>The days ahead will rock the foundations of many of the lives of your people; there will be no doubt of this. How you respond as individuals and as a collective has been the subject of much debate and study for eons of time, and we are as uncertain how you will choose to experience these events ahead as some of you may be uncertain as well. What we plan to do is make your choices crystal clear, and to lay out for you like a roadmap these paths so you will be able to carefully study these lanes and more accurately see where each one leads. This is what we can do for you and we will do just this, and each and every one of you will have the opportunity to see clearly all the roads before you that will lead you from today to the end of this chapter in your history. </p>\n<p>We feel that uncertainty is a cause of a great amount of the fear that many of you are feeling at this time, and it is uncertainty that we feel is an undue part of the equation and we will make every effort to remove this factor from the equation. We would like to say at this time that there will be at least one path that leads you through these events unscathed and unhurt, and that will allow you to experience your ascension into the higher realms according to the wishes many of you expressed before your current incarnations. This will be one of your choices, and this choice will not be taken away or disappear for any reason. Understanding this should put some of your minds at ease as you now know that this path exists and will present itself for you to consider and to choose if this is what you wish.</p>\n<p>To recognize this path we suggest to you to review your tools that can help you better recognize and discriminate between the paths of love and fear. It will be up to you to make each decision going forward, and we wish you to always keep in mind that at any time you can exit one path and begin on another if you choose. You may find that you are walking on a path that begins to grow darker as night begins to set in. You may, if you choose, exit that path and step foot on the ground warmed by the light of the sun. There will be many opportunities for you to recognize which path it is you walk upon, and as we have said, we will do what we can to make your choices as clear as possible, but will not unduly influence your decision-making. </p>\n<p>We understand many of you may be confused at this time and may be feeling fear as you are beginning to learn of events that will surely present themselves. We suggest to you to find your place of center, to remain calm and balanced, and to consider the choices before you. Proceeding in a calm and balanced unemotional state will better prepare your mind for the decisions you will have to make. Making any decisions from a state of imbalanced emotion may cause you to make decisions you feel at that time are in your best interest, but may lead you down a path you would not have chosen if you had remained emotionally balanced. This is why we tell you that fear and its many properties is so detrimental to your journey, as fear clouds your vision and confuses your decision making. Give yourself the opportunity to clearly choose the path you wish to travel by resisting any fear. </p>\n<p>As we have said, there is nothing to fear, and at least one of your paths will be smooth, safe and secure, and will lead you through to your ascension. If you remain in a calm and balanced state of emotion this path will shine bright to you and will call you by your name, and there will be no way you can miss it if this is what you choose. Considering this, how important do you feel it is at this time to remove any fear that may dwell inside you and to resist it if it should knock upon your door? Will you make it a priority each and every day and give your sincerest efforts to examine your emotions and work to better control them? We suggest to you to do just this and put aside all of your 3rd dimensional distractions and work on this, studying your emotions and learning to better deal with them. </p>\n<p>There are many Lightworkers out there among you who have trained extensively to be of service to you in this very field, and we say to you do not be shy and to ask for their guidance as this is why they are here and this is their mission at this time. If you are receiving guidance from another and they are assisting you to remove the obstacle of fear from your path, than we say to you that you have successfully found a worker of the light who is here in love and service at this time. If you are receiving guidance from another who is reinforcing your fears or adding to your fears in any way, we say to you walk away from this person as they may mean well, but they are not doing the work of the light that they may claim to be doing. </p>\n<p>Again, we suggest to you to take as much time as you possibly can during each and every day and review carefully your emotions. Are you feeling calm reassurance and security, optimism, hope and courage, or are you becoming nervous and scared, unsure, unconfident, and frightened for your safety and the safety of your family? If you are, then we suggest to you to seek guidance from another. We suggest to you to begin to openly engage in conversation with others that you have met through communities of light and engage in conversations that will lead you to the guidance you seek. Those of the light who are highly trained, skilled, and very qualified to offer you this guidance are here in your world in great numbers and they are here throughout your online community, as they have followed their call in service for the light and they want nothing more than to be of service to you at this time. This is why they are Lightworkers, and this is why they are here, in honor and duty they will fulfill their missions. Allow them to do what they have come here to do and reach out to them as they will reach out to you, and this is how it will be from this day forward as none of you have to walk any of these paths along. We are here as well, we are watching over you, and we want nothing more than for you to successfully choose the path that you wish to travel and we will do all that we can to see to this. This is our assignment, and in honor of duty we will fulfill our mission as well. </p>\n<p>For some of you, stored within your subconscious are memories of this past event, and this is all you will have of this emotion. You will not have to relive this past catastrophe if you do not choose to. This is your choice at this time. You will not have replayed in your mind the events of your past, and you will not have to relive this experience or the emotions tied to them. You are being given the opportunity to purify yourselves of this past traumatic incident. You are being given the opportunity to clear not only these deep rooted emotions seated within you, but also to eradicate this past event from your experience. This is a tremendous opportunity for you and everyone to clear the residue of this event from your memory banks. This is what many of you have come here to do, as these deep rooted memories and buried emotions have stifled somewhat your advancement. </p>\n<p>You have come back here at this time with the opportunity to replay this event and achieve through this opportunity a new outcome. Tremendous effort has gone into the planning of this event by many beings and many organizations throughout this universe, and we say to you to take advantage of this opportunity given you as this opportunity will not be offered again. What you are being offered is so rare in this universe that we say to you it is likely this kind of opportunity will never be offered anyone anywhere again. Do you understand now a little better why you all are blessed to be here and why you are being given this opportunity? </p>\n<p>Many of you have learned how important it is to clear deep-seated emotions that work to weigh you down and interfere with your progression through your path of existence. There are many techniques available to release these deep rooted emotions from yourselves, and this entire scenario of your world has been designed as a tool to assist you to release an experience that, for many of you, has been the most traumatic and is giving you the most trouble on your journey. By reliving this event and choosing a different outcome, you will have the ability to clear this negative energy from your being. Whether you choose to do this or not is entirely your decision, and we will honor each and every choice you make. </p>\n<p>We will only say to you that a great deal of effort has gone into this process, and you have also gone through so much to reach this point to have before you this opportunity, and we say to you do not squander it, take full advantage of it, and do what it is you have come here to do. No matter the outcome, none of you will regret being given this opportunity, and again, what you choose to do with it is up to you. There were many who wished to be here at this time, but their desire could not be accommodated. You are one of the fortunate ones, and we remind you of this only to motivate you to take full advantage of this blessed opportunity. We see so many of you doing just that and taking full advantage of your opportunities at this time. </p>\n<p>We say to you there is something else you can do as well that will not only benefit you, but your brothers and sisters as well, and that is to assist your brother and your sister to also use this opportunity to its fullest benefit. Those are some of your choices at this time, and as we have said, you will have many choices presented to you and we will do our part to make these choices as clear to you as we possibly can. We will do what we can and take every step necessary to allow you to recognize these choices, and let you know when it is time to choose. </p>\n<p>Today you are being given the choice as to whether you wish to proceed with your learning and your growth, or whether you wish to go back to the lives that you have become accustomed to, close your doors and your windows and try to somehow block out the events that are transpiring around you. That is your choice today, and you are required to make a decision and then proceed with your life along that path. There will be new paths presented to you along the way, and you will have further opportunities to decide which way you would like to advance, or return back to where you are now and shut out the world around you. This is your choice, and we await your decision. </p>\n<p>All along your journey you have had the opportunity to continue forward or stop your progress, and each and every one of you has chosen to move forward and that is why each and every one of you is here at this time today. We only suggest to you that you have gone this far and have gone through so much to reach this point, so why stop now when you are so very close to the goal you had in mind the day you set out on your very long journey. </p>\n<p>We are the Galactic Federation of Light.</p>\n<p>As channeled through Greg Giles </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ascensionearth2012.blogspot.com/\">http://ascensionearth2012.blogspot.com/</a></p>\n", "post_id": 1446, "location": false, "date": "04-03-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["belonging", "love", "generosity", "compassion", "joy", "create", "peace", "Life", "community", "imagination", "utopia", "passion", "together", "freedom", "positivity", "receiving", "humanity", "happiness", "hope"], "text": "<p>This post was written by one of my Mother&#8217;s good friends.

But, that&#8217;s not what I&#8217;m going to write about.  </p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve had a few &#8220;epiphanies&#8221; over the past year or so.  I&#8217;ve realized a few things that have changed my outlook on life.  One thing in particular I want to share with everyone because I think it&#8217;s something that requires attention is what I realized a few days ago. </p>\n<p>I use StumbleUpon a lot because it helps inspire my creativity.  I was using it a few days ago and I came across a page that asked what was most important:  Money, love, friends, fame, and there was a fifth one but I forget what it was.  I pondered this for a few moments.  Money was good to have, but it wasn&#8217;t more important than love.  Fame would be cool, but I&#8217;m more of an introvert so it kind of gave me an anxiety attack.  Friends are good to have, but again, I prefer as few people in my life as possible.  Love had to be first in my mind.  Because I couldn&#8217;t imagine living without my husband and the bond that we share.  I couldn&#8217;t imagine coming home to an empty house, not having someone to share good news with, not having someone to play video games with or watch our weekly television shows with.  </p>\n<p>Then something else hit me.  We routinely play the Mega Millions and the Powerball in an attempt to become overnight millionaires.  We write lists of what we&#8217;ll do with the money, carefully accounting for taxes and such.  We planned out the new house that we would have built from the ground up, the amount of money we would spend lavishing our family members with brand new cars and paying off their mortgages.  We plan how much will go into retirement, we plan how many CDs and savings accounts we&#8217;ll distribute the money into, and what charities we want to donate tons of money to.  (He chose Deborah and I chose to help domestic violence victims and animals\u2026 in case anyone cares.)  </p>\n<p>But here&#8217;s one thing we didn&#8217;t think of.  Is all this money going to make everyone happy?  Sure, we will have a brand new house and brand new cars, but I&#8217;ll still be sick and have writer&#8217;s block.  (I can&#8217;t really think of a reason he wouldn&#8217;t be happy, which is why I didn&#8217;t mention anything.)  </p>\n<p>My parents would have a new house and a new car, but she&#8217;ll still have trouble getting up, staying awake, and staying functional, and my father will still be unable to walk like he used to because of his recently injured knee. </p>\n<p>My sister will have enough money to support her cat colony (&#8217;cause at this point, that&#8217;s precisely what it is) but she will still be in an unhappy marriage to a man who values his mother&#8217;s opinion over all else and she will still be mentally unhealthy and even with all the money she needs to see a doctor and get herself on the right meds, her anxiety will still prevent her from doing just that. </p>\n<p>And my mother-in-law?  She&#8217;ll have her house paid off.  Her parents extensive medical bills will be paid.  But she&#8217;ll still have a weak heart, she&#8217;ll still be unable to turn her neck all to one way because of an accident she had as an on-duty police officer years and years ago, and her parents will still be on death&#8217;s doorstep.  </p>\n<p>My brother-in-law will have whatever he wants, but he&#8217;ll still have to finish high school and figure out what the hell he&#8217;s going to do with the rest of his life.  He&#8217;s thinking of going into the army, so the possibility of him dying sooner than he should still exists, even if he can afford everything he wants.  </p>\n<p>The house we were going to buy to rent out to a low-income family for $400 a month, maybe less, depending on their income, but no more than that, isn&#8217;t going to make their problems go away, whatever those problems are. </p>\n<p>The charities we donate to&#8211;yeah, the money will help them a lot.  A million dollars to each?  They sure could do a shit ton with that.  But you know what?  At the end of the day, there are still going to be people dying of heart attacks, there will still be people who can&#8217;t pay for their surgeries, there will still be abused and neglected animals, and there will still be women out there who are afraid to tell anyone that their husband beats the shit out of them on a weekly basis for no reason at all. </p>\n<p>Money doesn&#8217;t solve everything.  Money won&#8217;t make me any less obsessive-compulsive, it won&#8217;t erase the schizophrenia diagnosis that litters my medical charts.  It won&#8217;t make my mother&#8217;s tumor go away.  It won&#8217;t make every battered woman covered in bruises magically married to a sweet, loving man like the one I am lucky to have.  It certainly won&#8217;t make animals grow back their hair where they were burned with cigarettes or bitten by other animals in dog-fighting rings.  It won&#8217;t give people healthy hearts.  (Well, actually, it might do that, but only for those who have the money, which in and of itself is sad.)  </p>\n<p>Love can fix so much more.  Love stops me from crying when I&#8217;ve had a bad day and my husband brings me chocolate because he understands that chocolate makes everything better.<br />\nLove can survive anything.  If our apartment burned down tomorrow, we would lose all of our material possessions, but we wouldn&#8217;t lose our love for each other.  My mother might die tomorrow, but I won&#8217;t lose the love she had for me and I will certainly not stop loving her.  For three years we survived on the cheapest food we could find and the cheapest store, and there were nights I was hungry, but I was with my husband.  And love made it easier to get through.  </p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t care if we ever become millionaires.  I don&#8217;t care if we spend the rest of our lives struggling to pay bills.  I don&#8217;t care if in another eight years we have to file for bankruptcy again.  I don&#8217;t care if we live in an apartment for the rest of our lives because we can&#8217;t afford a house.  We love each other.  We have each other, and now I truly understand what it means to be the richest woman in the world.  </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://nowisthebeginning.wordpress.com/\">Now is the Beginning</a></p>\n", "post_id": 1455, "location": false, "date": "04-05-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["belonging", "love", "generosity", "compassion", "joy", "create", "peace", "Life", "community", "imagination", "utopia", "passion", "together", "freedom", "positivity", "receiving", "humanity", "happiness", "hope"], "text": "<p><strong><em>April 5, 2012</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Lou Catarino</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://talesfromthelou.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/cosmic-rose-benheine-scaled1000.jpg\"><img title=\"cosmic-rose-benheine-scaled1000\" src=\"https://talesfromthelou.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/cosmic-rose-benheine-scaled1000_thumb.jpg?w=241&#038;h=244\" alt=\"cosmic-rose-benheine-scaled1000\" width=\"241\" height=\"244\" border=\"0\" /></a></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Tristan asked me to write a post about love.

I thought I had this one in the bag. I looked at his list of requirements and knew that these were all things that I did on a regular basis, so it would only be a matter of whipping up a few blog posts and I\u2019d have myself a shiny new blogging award. The first one was easy, I\u2019d already written it. The second one I didn\u2019t even know was going to be a submission until it was. This third one though\u2026</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve sat down to write it a few times already, and I kept coming up blank. I kept thinking to myself \u201cWe just don\u2019t have that much excess around here\u201d. We\u2019re young, we\u2019ve got two kids, a mortgage and we\u2019re still paying off our student loans. To say that money can get a bit tight would be an understatement. We can\u2019t really afford to give to charities, we don\u2019t have a lot of time to volunteer, we don\u2019t even buy those heart and stroke tickets when it\u2019s that time of year.</p>\n<p>So, I was stumped. I suddenly started to feel like we weren\u2019t very generous people. Yes, money is tight, but sometimes it seems like we have so much more than our share. I should say, by the way, that most of this inner dialogue was occurring while I was (wait for it) gathering toys and clothing to drop off at the Goodwill. Talk about a \u201cDuh\u201d moment. The truth is, we do this so often that it never even occurred to me that we were being charitable. But that\u2019s not what I\u2019m considering to be my act of generosity.</p>\n<p>Like I said, I\u2019ve been having trouble coming up with something to write about, and because I have the good fortune to actually be friends with Tristan, he suggested that I write about some of the things I have been doing to help him out with the Alternate Economy. The thing is, though, that I don\u2019t really consider that generosity either. I would be doing this whether I had excess time or not. I believe wholeheartedly in this cause, and I would certainly make time for it even if it was damn near impossible. I don\u2019t consider helping him giving of my excess anymore than he considers all the work he puts into it giving of his. It\u2019s necessary to making this world a better place, and if I can convince even just one more person out there to offer him a helping hand in any way they\u2019re able to, than I\u2019ve done my good deed for the day. But this isn\u2019t my act of generosity either.</p>\n<p>So by now you must be thinking \u201cQuit beating around the bush, already, what are you writing about?!\u201d</p>\n<p>Okay, okay. I hear ya. I finally discovered what I have in excess; Smiles. I\u2019m always smiling. Even when I\u2019m grumpy and sad I figure, Hey, what have I got to lose? Absolutely nothing, and everything to gain. Smiling makes you and everyone else feel better. It\u2019s hard to be angry at a person who has a genuine and Loving smile on their face.</p>\n<p>You may be saying to yourself, \u201cWell that\u2019s kind of a cop out, those other things you talked about were clearly more generous than just smiling.\u201d And I understand your point of view, but let me give you an example of when excess smiles given generously really do make a difference. Earlier today I was sitting in a hospital waiting room. My father has a degenerative disease that effects his spine and is preparing to go under the knife for the third time in ten years. Usually my mother would have driven him the 3 hours to Toronto to attend the appointment, but she just couldn\u2019t get the time off work, so I volunteered. While my father was in with the Doctor, another couple came in and approached reception. There was some confusion and raised voices and the woman was clearly upset. Through some error in communication between her family doctor and the neurologist, her appointment had been cancelled. She also had traveled quite a distance to visit this specialist, and was visibly and understandably upset by this turn of events. She and her husband sat across from me and they had a bit of an argument. Not because they were mad at each other, but because both were frustrated and worried that they would have to take more time from work to come to another appointment. I\u2019m not exaggerating when I tell you that this woman was on the verge of tears. Now, I didn\u2019t know this woman, and there were probably no really useful words I could have said to calm her down. Instead, when I caught her eye, I smiled. She grinned back, clearly just being polite, and went back to flipping hastily through a magazine. The next time I caught her eye, I smiled again and said \u201cOne of those days, huh?\u201d And she chuckled, took a deep breath and  returned a smile that was just as genuine as my own and I could tell that she was starting to feel better.</p>\n<p>Imagine a world where we did our best to make other people feel better. I know that something as simple as a smile can brighten someones day, so I give them freely. I never run out, they replenish like magic. And I\u2019ll let you in on a little secret, if you look very closely, you\u2019ll find that you have an endless supply of smiles too. We may not all have the cash to give away, or closets full of clothes we no longer wear, or even extra time to spend at our local animal shelters. But we do have smiles, lots of them. So many, in fact, that we can just give them away.</p>\n<p> <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)</span> </p>\n", "post_id": 1478, "location": false, "date": "04-06-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["emotion", "love", "cancer", "give", "age of aquarius", "creation", "evidence", "gemini", "selfishness", "alternative", "hate", "fear", "happiness", "astrology", "gratitude", "selfish", "inheritance", "alternate", "passion", "remorse", "creationism", "hope", "economy", "compassion", "joy", "survival", "aquarius", "judgement", "protection", "security", "loss", "evolution", "receive", "universe", "foolishness", "generosity", "hatred", "balance", "greed", "proof"], "text": "<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Bacterial Evolution</span></p>\n<p>Bacteria present a fascinating subject for the study of evolution.\u00a0 Since the average generation for a bacteria is about 1 hour long, scientists can observe hundreds of generations as they react to new stimuli in their environment and adapt to survive.\u00a0 One thing that has been popping up in some journals in the Scientific community is the interesting fact that bacteria always adapt in the same way, using the same genes.</p>\n<p>When a researcher isolates 10 separate cultures of bacteria in 10 separate petri dishes and then exposes them to a chemical that would ordinarily kill it, the bacteria always responds in one of two ways.\u00a0 The bacteria either dies upon exposure to the new chemical.\u00a0 Or the bacteria adapts by expressing a new gene to deal with that chemical.\u00a0 The thing is, no matter how many times the experiment is reproduced, the bacteria always produce the same gene to adapt.\u00a0 They also always manage to adapt before the population is wiped out completely assuming that the chemical is introduced in a reasonable amount.</p>\n<p>Another interesting thing about this experiment is that when you perform it on two separate species of bacteria, they still adapt in identical ways.\u00a0 It almost seems like there is only one gene that will deal with each stimulus we expose the bacteria to.\u00a0 They either find it or they don&#8217;t.\u00a0 But they always do find it before the last bacteria disappears.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Evolution with the help of consciousness?</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Monarch Butterfly Migration</span></p>\n<p>The Monarch Butterfly is unique in nature.\u00a0 It is the only insect to migrate from north to south and back again with the seasons.\u00a0 The Monarch has many summer pastures that it visits, but in the winter, the entire population of this species migrates to one of only a couple of locations in Mexico.\u00a0 The spots they travel to are always the same, year in and year out.\u00a0 They hibernate by sleeping in large clumps on trees.\u00a0 It seems they return to the same trees every year.</p>\n<p>The thing that makes this spectacular is that the average lifespan of a Monarch Butterfly is 2 months.\u00a0 It is not the same individuals migrating north that migrate south.\u00a0 It is not even their children.\u00a0 It is the grandchildren and great-grandchildren of these insects that return to the exact same trees every year that their deceased relatives used to hibernate on.</p>\n<p>How is this possible?\u00a0 Butterflies do not appear to have any language or way to communicate such incredibly complicated directions to their offspring.\u00a0 Science currently has no explanation for why this phenomenon occurs.

The goal is so far away, being Buddha &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.. it will take lifetimes of effort, or what seems like the efforts of many lives. But I know one thing for sure: somehow it means Love.</p>\n<p>Now, there are Teachings galore, giving guidance toward training one&#8217;s mind, toward changing one&#8217;s ways of being so that the clouded Buddha self can begin to shine. The Dharma is rich &amp; varied, &amp; presented in many ways, so that all personalities, &amp; all levels of growth can find it useful. But the Teachings don&#8217;t tell each of us how to live love in our personal lives; we have to figure the particulars out ourselves. And with the goal so distant, I asked: Wah! What am I supposed to do in the meantime?!? If I&#8217;m not yet that Buddha-to-be, or &#8212; more accurately: manifesting the Buddha-that-I-am &#8212; what do I do with myself until then?? </p>\n<p>I seriously want to know, for I don&#8217;t want to waste any more time. (Well, let&#8217;s be honest here: I don&#8217;t want to waste all of my time, but I&#8217;m likely to waste some of it, lol) Here I am though in what is probably just the middle of a very long life, &amp; the old ways of being don&#8217;t satisfy anymore. I mean, those ways &amp; days of just pleasing myself, just doing what an external authority imposes upon me, just going through life haphazardly &#8230;&#8230;.. they are not enough. I want to make a difference, yet I am so small, certainly no Aung San Suu Kyi, no Emmeline Pankhurst, no Martin Luther King, Jr. I think the grand gestures that some can accomplish are beyond what I can do; at least it feels that way now. But it does feel right to live in Love, somehow.</p>\n<p>Wondering what Living Love means, I asked these questions in my dreams, in my prayers, in my meditations, asking &amp; fretting because my long-time habit is to be easily discouraged, &amp; to give up. I queried: How do I DO this? How can my frail efforts add up enough to be progress toward my Buddha Goal? How would I be worthy of it until I can reach it?? And one day, suddenly I knew! I knew the answer to my question: &#8220;What do I do until I&#8217;m Enlightened??&#8221; Make the world more bearable for someone else.</p>\n<p>And this is what I believe Living Love IS. It is bringing some relief to another&#8217;s suffering, lightening their load, helping them be a little happier. Small efforts? Maybe. Worthy efforts? Oh, for sure, because here&#8217;s what I realize as I write this (ding! ding! ding!): No matter what the effort is, or how small, if it is loving, if it is an act of Love, then it is Living Love, &amp; there&#8217;s no waste in that.</p>\n", "post_id": 1529, "location": false, "date": "04-08-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["emotion", "peace", "love", "cancer", "unemployment", "age of aquarius", "universal", "idea", "community", "imagination", "gemini", "moral", "thanks", "selfishness", "fear", "education", "hate", "alternative", "happiness", "astrology", "gratitude", "selfish", "Life", "together", "universe", "inheritance", "justice", "employment", "create", "alternate", "reality", "religion", "passion", "economy", "greatness", "remorse", "receiving", "humanity", "hope", "2012", "belonging", "absolute truth", "compassion", "joy", "aquarius", "judgement", "protection", "imagine", "law", "hatred", "morality", "discussion", "loss", "give", "forum", "currency", "receive", "science", "conversation", "foolishness", "generosity", "utopia", "truth", "freedom", "security", "balance", "positivity", "greed"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/thoughts-generosity.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1539\" title=\"Thoughts-Generosity\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/thoughts-generosity.jpg?w=300&#038;h=224\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"224\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>What is Generosity?</strong></p>\n<table width=\"150\" border=\"1\" bgcolor=\"#99ccff\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;\" align=\"center\"><a href=\"http://alternate-economy.com/wordpress/blog/2011/12/30/generosity-2/\">Core Essay on Generosity</a></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Generosity is one of the least understood of the core emotions.  There is a feeling in our society that Generosity implies the giving of wealth.  The most Generous people, by definition, would have to also be the wealthiest people.  But this is not so.  Generosity comes from far more than the giving of gifts of wealth.  We can give many other gifts as well.  There is the gift of time.  The gift of compassion.  The gift of hope.  The gift of support in troubled times.  The gift of a story, to help us find perspective.</p>\n<p>True Generosity comes from a decision to share.  Not just our wealth.  But to share all of ourselves.  To put ourselves in a position of vulnerability and see that from that place we can only create Love around us.  Generosity, in all its forms, creates gratitude.  When we open ourselves up to truly sharing our Love, we begin to see that no story from our past can bring us harm.  They can only help us to move forward in Love.</p>\n<p>When we live in Generosity we begin to see that possessions are meaningless.  It is not what we own that defines us, but what we share.  We see that our passions are what allow us to contribute most Generously to society.  We see that Love is spread through giving.  We see that Life is meant to be Shared with those around us.  There is a time for quiet introspection, a time to receive with sincere gratitude and a time to give unconditionally to those in need.  In true Generosity we begin to see that Love is in the simple acts.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/badge.jpg\"><img src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/badge.jpg?w=300&#038;h=300\" alt=\"\" title=\"badge\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1497\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>This Weeks Challenge</strong></p>\n<p>Generosity, by definition, is simply the liberal and unselfish sharing of excesses. On the surface, it would appear that this portion of the challenge is a no brainer; gather some of your old stuff or throw some cash in an envelope and proceed to the closest charitable organization. Of course you can do that, and it would be appreciated, but the whole point of this challenge is to make you think, and learn to incorporate Generosity into your daily life. I don&#8217;t know about you, but if I relied simply on giving away material possessions and money as my only method of Generosity, then I wouldn&#8217;t be able to be generous for very long. There are so many other ways to be Generous, many of which you are probably already doing on a daily basis. The purpose of this challenge is to get you to recognize more clearly the ways in which you are already being Generous, and to expand that Generosity until it becomes habit.</p>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:awards@alternate-economy.com\">Send Entries to awards@alternate-economy.com</a></p>\n<p>The following challenge is split into three categories.

No, but surely you know that I am, just as I know that you are.</p>\n<p>The Truth is not found by making assumptions. The Truth is found by listening. Listening is akin to awareness and is probably better described as such. Awareness is the ability to look at a situation from every angle and every perspective. Once we remove our emotions from our assessment of a situation and begin to truly listen to the message contained within, we will always hear it. The thing about the Truth is once it is found it is undeniable and cannot be forgotten. But we will only find it when we are aware of the cause and effect of our actions. When we begin to look at the series of events that lead up to each interaction in our lives we will see that they all flow from one to the other quite logically. If we can calm our souls and quiet our emotional responses, we are able to live in awareness. Once we are able to identify the series of decisions that have brought us to the current situation, we are almost always able to deal with that situation in a much healthier way.</p>\n<p>I have presented a lot of information in this document as if it were the absolute Truth of our Universe. I am not a PhD student in any of the sciences, nor am I a theologian or an expert in astrology. I do not have any fancy degrees on my wall, nor any commendations from respected members of society. What I have is awareness. That is all. I am aware of my surroundings. I pay attention to the details in my life and attempt to discern patterns in my behaviour and the behaviour of others. I read a lot. But mostly I experience. I live within the cycle of Karma, rather than fighting against it.</p>\n<p>I am not different in any way other than my dedication to awareness. The Truth always presents itself to those who are willing to listen. The Truth is not something we create, or imagine, or believe, or like, or dislike, or want, or need. The Truth just is.</p>\n<p>All of the steps in my life to this point have brought me to the realization that the Earth is representative of a single Truth.</p>\n<p>The Idea of Love is best expressed with Balanced Emotions.</p>\n<p>If you take the time to look at your life in awareness, there is only one Truth that you will discover. It is the same Truth I have discovered. I did not create this Truth. It does not exist because I approve of it. It simply is. There can be no other Truth.</p>\n<p>It is interesting the simplicity of our emotions. In remorse love is bad. In joy love is good. In loss love is hard. In the spirit of receiving love is easy. In hatred love is ugly. In passion love is beautiful. In fear love is leaving you. In hope love is coming to you. In judgment love is earned. In compassion love is given. In greed love is mine alone. In generosity love is everyone&#8217;s.</p>\n<p>If we can remember that love is good, love is easy, love is beautiful, love is coming, love is given and love is everyone&#8217;s we will always live in love.</p>\n<p>I have discovered this not because I am perfect, but because I have made many mistakes. Through awareness, however, I have turned those mistakes into Truths. The proof is my failed relationships. The proof is the abundance of failed relationships we are surrounded with. How many truly successful loving relationships do you know of that do not suffer from unbalanced emotions? For all the wisdom I have spouted, I have never lived in one. Does that mean that a life of love is impossible? Of course not.</p>\n<p>What this means is that there is only one way to live in love. The Truth.</p>\n<p>The Idea of Love is best expressed with Balanced Emotions.</p>\n<p>Once we figure out this essential Truth, the rest is easy. The Truth of our Planet is that love is good, love is easy, love is beautiful, love is coming, love is given and love is everyone&#8217;s. Nothing else is true. Everything else is a wounded emotion. Everything else leads to loss, remorse, hatred, judgment, fear and greed. There is only one Truth and it does not care if we understand it or not. It will exist either way.</p>\n<p>The Idea of Love is best expressed with Balanced Emotions.</p>\n<p>You may read this and think to yourself, how can I claim to have healed all of my emotions when I have so many failed relationships. I respond to you that I am still in the process of healing. I would like to live in love. I have written my thoughts down and shared them with the world in the hope that my message of healing and love will be accepted for what it is. I offer it to you as my first step towards living in love. If you have read this far it is because you recognize a Truth to the words I have written. It is my hope that I will begin to share a love equal to that of a life partner with everyone in my life. It starts with you. My hope is that upon reading this you will see that I am ready to live in love. I also have faith in your ability to live in love or I would not have shared this with you. I have faith that you will understand that the love I offer you is not of a sexual nature. It does not imply dependence, or any pressure for you to perform in a particular way. It is true love. The love of a friend that will always be there for you, no matter what happens to you. If you falter, I will be there to lend a hand. When you succeed I will be there to share your success. I love you. I cannot promise to be best friends with 250,000 people. But I can promise that if you ever reach out to me in the future, that I will be there for you. No matter what you offer to me, I will try to remember that love is good, love is easy, love is beautiful, love is coming, love is given and love is everyone&#8217;s. And I will respond with love in my heart. That is my promise to you.</p>\n<p>I would like to live in love and I would like you to join me.</p>\n<p>One thing I have noticed in my life is that very few people dare to do something great with their lives. Humans built the pyramids without the help of motorized vehicles, electricity or in some cases iron tools. We built them with our bare hands. Some may say it was slavery that built the pyramids, but the truth is that those slaves accomplished something great that has never been repeated since.</p>\n<p>I would like to build the pyramids. Not in a physical sense, and certainly not with slaves. But the idea behind the Alternate Economy is something that has a greatness to it. But just like the pyramids, I will never build this Alternate Economy alone. It will take a huge number of people working together. We will sweat and bleed and cry and laugh and love. But we will succeed if we can trust in each other to be great.</p>\n<p>My hope is that these documents will inspire you to greatness. I believe you have it in you. I believe that everyone has it in them to be great. So long as they can move past their woundedness and trust in themselves and the rest of humanity.</p>\n<p>Yours through eternity, if you will have me,</p>\n<p>Tristan Nagler</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.alternate-economy.com\">http://www.alternate-economy.com</a></p>\n", "post_id": 155, "location": false, "date": "12-22-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["emotion", "alternate", "love", "cancer", "give", "age of aquarius", "gemini", "thanks", "selfishness", "alternative", "hate", "fear", "happiness", "astrology", "gratitude", "selfish", "inheritance", "peace", "passion", "remorse", "hope", "economy", "compassion", "joy", "aquarius", "judgement", "protection", "security", "loss", "receive", "freedom", "foolishness", "generosity", "universe", "hatred", "balance", "greed"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/untitled7.png\"><img src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/untitled7.png?w=214&#038;h=236\" alt=\"\" title=\"untitled7\" width=\"214\" height=\"236\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1561\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://mindmindful.wordpress.com/2012/04/09/sharing/\">Sharing</a></p>\n<p>In our world today, there are many words that are ill-defined.  Due to their personal nature, the words themselves begin to take on a new meaning for each person that uses them.  One of my goals with my philosophical musings is to take common words and attempt to define them in a way that everyone can agree upon.  I have done this once before with the word \u201cGenerosity\u201c.  I concluded that Generosity is one of the core emotions and encompasses the act of giving freely of our excess with no expectations in return.  But what about \u201cSharing\u201d?  Can it be defined in the same way as Generosity?  Or is sharing something more?  Is there a subtle difference between the two concepts?  Is it possible to be Generous without Sharing? In order to ever fully understand a word, we must live in Awareness.  Awareness is the ability to simply allow the Universe to speak to you.  It is allowing yourself to see every perspective, not just your own.  It is taking the time to ponder a situation, before we choose our course of action.  As I sit here, feeling rather stumped for an example of Sharing, it occurs to me that&#8230;</p>\n<p>To read the rest of the post that I wrote for MindMindful, please visit her blog:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://mindmindful.wordpress.com/2012/04/09/sharing/\">Sharing</a></p>\n<p>This post will not appear on my blog, so please go to <a href=\"http://mindmindful.wordpress.com/\">MindMindful</a> to read it!</p>\n<p>Congratulations again to MindMindful on her successful completion of the Living in Love Challenge</p>\n", "post_id": 1560, "location": false, "date": "04-09-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["emotion", "alternate", "love", "cancer", "give", "age of aquarius", "gemini", "thanks", "selfishness", "alternative", "hate", "fear", "film", "astrology", "gratitude", "selfish", "story", "inheritance", "peace", "writing", "passion", "happiness", "remorse", "hope", "economy", "compassion", "joy", "aquarius", "judgement", "protection", "security", "loss", "receive", "freedom", "foolishness", "movies", "universe", "hatred", "balance", "greed", "generosity"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/film-slate.jpg\"><img src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/film-slate.jpg?w=300&#038;h=198\" alt=\"\" title=\"film-slate\" width=\"300\" height=\"198\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1565\" /></a></p>\n<p>I am all about living within your passions and sharing them with others, as many of you know.

I sat in one seat, but it was a bit chilly the shade, so I moved. From my new in the sun, I could see a group of men gathered round a table playing cards.

Each on of them would likely die for the man beside him.</p>\n\n<p>At the table directly across from me sat a man, likely in his mid-50\u2019s. A seemingly plain man, he sat patiently and drank coffee. I went on writing, and some men in ties approached me and asked how I felt about the Bible. I told them I wasn\u2019t a big fan.

In its negative form, we feel that everything in the world is &#8220;mine&#8221;.  This is the selfish form, which comes from greed.  Greed is currently the most destructive aspect of human emotion.  Greed has caused individuals to accumulate as much private property as they possibly can in the search for happiness.  Once this property is theirs, they feel a satisfaction in knowing that no one else is allowed to claim it.  Greed centers around property.  &#8220;It is mine and nobody else can have it.&#8221;  It leads to a sense of superiority and power.  But it arrives from a cycle of abuse.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/world.jpg\"><img src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/world.jpg?w=150&#038;h=150\" alt=\"\" title=\"world\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" class=\"alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-1579\" /></a></p>\n<p>Selfishness arises from scarcity. When there is not enough to go around, it becomes important to secure a claim over the limited resources available in order to ensure your happiness.  Happiness arises from balance, and a lack of any one thing disturbs this balance.  Selfishness enters the scenario when our balance is disturbed.  We feel the need to restore this balance by claiming ownership over certain resources, so that we no longer have to worry about living without that resource in the future.  This becomes cyclical, however, because of greed.  Greed is living in excess of balance.  When we are forced to become selfish because we are struggling to provide a certain resource for ourselves, we often overcompensate when we finally do receive access to that resource.  Because we have had to fight to attain it, once we have access to it, we take as much as we can and hoard that resource for the future.  By hoarding this resource, we now make it less accessible to the rest of our peers.  This causes a shortage of that resource, which causes selfishness in others.  All because of greed.</p>\n<p>When I look around the world today I see a lot of &#8220;lawless&#8221; behaviour.  Any criminal psychologist will agree that all crimes are committed for one of two reasons.  The main motivations for crime can always be traced to one of two things; poverty and passion.  I would like to propose that both of these forms are in fact one expression of emotion; greed.  Crimes from poverty are the most rampant in our world.  They arise from greed in a most obvious way.  But even criminals who boast massive fortunes and well-organized hierarchies are still motivated by poverty.  These underground groups always arise from the lower classes and draw their membership exclusively from it.</p>\n<p>I would like to posit that crimes of passion also arise from an innate sense of greed.  When we act out in passion it is almost always associated with a lover.  We act out because we feel someone or something is stopping us from creating true love with our lover.  Please note that I said &#8220;our lover&#8221;.  The lover is mine in this mentality.  When they cheat on you and you act out it is because they have stolen something that is yours and yours alone.  Greed.  If the abuse is repetitive it is almost always in order to control our lover.  We abuse them in passion so that they will not leave us.  They are ours and we can do what we want with them.  Again, greed.</p>\n<p>As with all of the aspects of emotion, greed has an equal and opposite expression.  When an individual looks at everything in the world and thinks &#8220;it&#8217;s ours&#8221; they are living in generosity.   As I said earlier, happiness arises from balance.  Therefore an excess of any resource does not mean more happiness.  It actually means less.  When you live in excess you must protect your assets from the greed of others.  This leads to worry, insecurity and even obsession; none of which are associated with happiness.  It seems greed and happiness are completely at odds, because greed necessitates a lack of balance.</p>\n<p>Generosity is looking at the world from the opposite perspective.  When we live in generosity and we receive an excess of a certain resource, rather than hoarding it, we share it freely.  We do not give away all of our resource.  We ensure that we keep enough for ourselves.  But the excess we share, because we know that we do not need it.  When we share with others we begin to enter a new cycle.  Because we have given freely of our excess, selfishness does not have an opportunity to enter the situation.  While hoarding spreads selfishness through reduced access to resources, sharing spreads gratitude through increased access to resources.  Now, our peers look to us in gratitude and when they have secured an excess of a resource that we require, they will feel bound to reciprocate by sharing with us.  A new cycle is formed.  A cycle where excess creates sharing which creates gratitude which in turns brings excess of a new resource to you.  All because of Generosity.</p>\n<p>I would like to propose that if we began to live in generosity, all of our current crime would disappear.  Crimes of poverty are motivated by a feeling that others have more than we do.  It seems so unfair that we should have to struggle to survive, when others have it so easy.  So we help ourselves to their resources without asking first.  This is called stealing.  In generosity this would never happen.  There is no incentive to steal things when you know you can just ask for it.  If the answer is always yes, then there is no need to be sneaky.</p>\n<p>The same applies to crimes of passion.  If we can accept that love is not something that is mine, but is rather something that is everyone&#8217;s, crimes of passion will disappear as well.  When we act out in passion we do so because we believe our lover belongs to us and so we have some innate right to cause them harm if they &#8220;hurt&#8221; us emotionally.  If we are able to accept that love is everyone&#8217;s we will see that nothing our lover could ever do will hurt us.  Because they love us and we love them.  If they begin to feel sexually attracted to another we will not lash out at them.  We will understand, because we are sexually attracted to many others as well.  All humans are.  Humans are not monogamous.  Sorry to burst your bubble.  There is no evidence to support this whatsoever.  Throughout history humans have always engaged in sex with multiple partners.  Always.  Prostitution is the oldest profession on earth for a reason.  If we can accept the true nature of our sexuality we will see that it is a resource, like any other.  It is meant to be shared freely.  We will have life partners, most likely, who we bear our children with to raise together in a shared home.  Or maybe we won&#8217;t.  But if we take lovers on the side this is no big deal.  Our partner is doing it too.  In fact everyone does it.  It is the natural order for humanity.  Some will cry STD&#8217;s. Sex is dirty.  Free sex leads to herpes and worse still, HIV.  I say, only if you are greedy.  If you are living in generosity, you will take the proper precautions to avoid exposing your partner to STD&#8217;s.  All STD&#8217;s are avoidable.  It is only greedy behaviour that spreads STD&#8217;s.  When we are greedy we hide our faults from our perspective lovers in the fear that they will reject us if they know.  Or we don&#8217;t even bother to check ourselves out in the first place.  In generosity we will know that our lover&#8217;s permissiveness includes a responsibility.</p>\n<p>It seems generosity is a form of expressing your emotions.  Greed is also a form of expressing your emotions, and it is one which most people express today.  Greed comes from abuse and only creates more greed.  It is a wounded emotion, where the expectation is that everything you have you need to fight for.  Generosity comes from love and only creates more generosity.  It is a healthy emotion, where the expectation is that everything you need will come to you, so long as you are willing to share what you have with others.  Once we are able to master this emotion, humanity will be able to see that there are currently more than enough resources to go around.  It only seems like there is a scarcity because of hoarding.  If we change this cycle and begin sharing our resources with each other freely, we will soon find that everyone has everything they could ever possibly need.  Generosity leads to balanced emotions which leads to Love.</p>\n<p>Read Next:</p>\n<table width=\"250\" border=\"1\" bgcolor=\"#99ccff\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://alternate-economy.com/wordpress/blog/2011/12/31/compassion/\">Compassion</a>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.alternate-economy.com\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.alternate-economy.com/Images/banner-alternate-economy.jpg\" alt=\"The Alternate Economy\" width=\"450\"></a></p>\n", "post_id": 1577, "location": false, "date": "04-10-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["emotion", "alternate", "love", "cancer", "give", "age of aquarius", "gemini", "thanks", "selfishness", "alternative", "hate", "fear", "film", "astrology", "gratitude", "selfish", "story", "inheritance", "peace", "writing", "passion", "happiness", "remorse", "hope", "economy", "compassion", "joy", "aquarius", "judgement", "protection", "security", "loss", "receive", "freedom", "foolishness", "movies", "universe", "hatred", "balance", "greed", "generosity"], "text": "<table width=\"150\" border=\"1\" bgcolor=\"#99ccff\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;\" align=\"center\"><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.wordpress.com/2012/04/09/week-1-generosity/\">Week 1: Generosity</a></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>As part of this weeks challenge on Generosity I have asked that you guys investigate three differing forms of Generosity.  Overt Generosity, Situational Generosity and True Sharing.  To prove to you that my words are not just wind, I will also be participating in this challenge and posting some examples for you guys to hopefully help get you inspired.</p>\n<p>Today I will discuss Overt Generosity, which in my opinion is the most common and obvious form.  It comes from acts that we initiate and plan before hand.  It happens when we are feeling Generous and wish to spread Love around us.  But it is not the only form of Generosity, as we shall see.</p>\n<p>To help illustrate what it is I feel Overt Generosity to be, I considered using the Alternate Economy as an example.  Last week I went to the local bee keeping supply store (<a href=\"http://www.zurcherhoney.com/\">Zurcher Honey</a>) and made a down payment for a beehive for the new <a href=\"http://alternate-economy.com/wordpress/farm/\">Experimental Farm</a>.  I deposited $200 from my birthday money and should be picking it up tomorrow and paying the final $445 of the bill.  I feel a little weird using this example, however, as it is a charity that I created.  It is kind of like giving to myself&#8230; which doesn&#8217;t seem especially Generous.  I know, the funds raised from the beehive will not be going to me personally, they will also be going back to the Alternate Economy, and yet still I feel that this is not quite the example I am searching for.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/gc_bees.jpg\"><img src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/gc_bees.jpg?w=235&#038;h=235\" alt=\"\" title=\"gc_bees\" width=\"235\" height=\"235\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1597\" /></a></p>\n<p>I also considered using the project that I am helping my good friend Linda with as an example.  She is in the process of expanding her small home business to the internet and I have offered to create a site with her at no charge.  We have worked on it a couple of times together and I did a few hours work on it this week.  I still feel that this is not the greatest example, because it is something I agreed to do some time ago, and still haven&#8217;t finished, even though it probably could be done by now.  Although it is Generous, it was not inspired by this challenge and so it doesn&#8217;t seem quite right.</p>\n<p>In the end, these examples are projects that I am already doing.  This challenge is about looking for new ways to be generous.  Since I still have a little birthday money left, I decided to spend it on a charity that I quite like but have neglected to donate to in over 3 years, <a href=\"http://www.heifer.org/\">Heifer.org</a>.  </p>\n<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='560' height='315' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/fDIedFMSN64?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span>\n<p>I couldn&#8217;t resist donating a <a href=\"https://secure1.heifer.org/gift-catalog/honeybees.html\">package of bees</a>, to a family in need, since I just bought a beehive for the Alternate Economy.

You can join us in making a difference in the lives by providing animals and training to Heifer India project participants.</p>\n<p>I feel like for this week, my Overt act of Generosity will be my donation to help impoverished families in India.  I donated $150 to this project and feel that if anyone is looking for an Overt act of Generosity for this week, <a href=\"http://www.heifer.org\">Heifer.org</a> is a good one.  Please take the time to look at their website.  You can donate as little as $10 or much as you wish and you can make donations via Paypal.</p>\n<p>Overt Generosity is the easy one, so that is why I started with this one.  There are literally millions of charities and families in need that could benefit from our help.  We can donate money, or time, or clothing, or food.  But it requires we make an effort.  Overt Generosity is easy to produce, yet easy to forget about.  We should be able to create a long list of things we are being Overtly Generous about in our lives.  And if the list does not satisfy us, we should continue to add to it.</p>\n", "post_id": 1582, "location": false, "date": "04-11-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["emotion", "alternate", "love", "cancer", "give", "age of aquarius", "gemini", "thanks", "selfishness", "alternative", "hate", "fear", "film", "astrology", "gratitude", "selfish", "story", "inheritance", "peace", "writing", "passion", "happiness", "remorse", "hope", "economy", "compassion", "joy", "aquarius", "judgement", "protection", "security", "loss", "receive", "freedom", "foolishness", "movies", "universe", "hatred", "balance", "greed", "generosity"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/widowscoins.jpg\"><img src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/widowscoins.jpg?w=300&#038;h=239\" alt=\"\" title=\"widowscoins\" width=\"300\" height=\"239\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1696\" /></a></p>\n<p>As part of this week&#8217;s Generosity Challenge, I have decided to participate and post some examples of my own that I have accomplished this week.  Although I expected this category to prove to be the easiest, in the end I was surprised.  I wouldn&#8217;t say that Situational Generosity is difficult, but it does require that we pay attention. It would seem that awareness is key to situational generosity. Participating in situational generosity is as easy and as difficult as identifying an opportunity for generosity and simply saying &#8220;yes.&#8221;  When we pay attention to those around us we will see that there are many opportunities that present themselves. For this week, i have kept a journal of situations that I was presented with, that I decided to say yes to.</p>\n<p><strong>Monday</strong> &#8211; A friend needed some company so I stayed up and chatted with her. Despite the fact that I was feeling tired and it was quite late at night, I could tell that she was feeling lonely so I decided to say yes.</p>\n<p><strong>Tuesday</strong> &#8211; I saw a homeless woman while in the car, and rolled down my window to give her a toonie. Although this is not very much money, this is a good example of being prepared to be generous. I often come to this corner, and find I don&#8217;t have any spare change, but this week I made sure to fill my cup holder with some coins.<br />\n        &#8211; I Cooked dinner for my brother while he was at work, Cornish hens&#8230;</p>\n<p><strong>Wednesday</strong> &#8211; I bought my friend rubber boots on the way to the farm. She is going to be helping me quite a bit this summer, so I offered to pay for the boots when we arrived at the cash register.</p>\n<p><strong>Thursday</strong> &#8211; When asked by my colleague if I was willing to let him go home early so he could watch the NHL playoffs, I agreed. </p>\n<p><strong>Friday</strong> &#8211; Gave my last doughnut to my brother, even though it was my favorite kind of doughnut.<br />\n       &#8211; After a very busy dinner service, I decided to buy a round of shots for the Kitchen, to spread some of my tips around.</p>\n<p><strong>Saturday</strong> &#8211; I picked up a shift at work, even though I had the night off.<br />\n         &#8211; To make sure neither one of us went home disappointed, my colleague and I shared our tips in a tip pool.<br />\n<strong><br />\nSunday</strong> &#8211; On my way to work, I stopped at a bakery and brought in some chocolate croissants for all the staff to share, just to start things off on a nice note.<br />\n       &#8211; When I had my friend over, I made him dinner and drove him home afterwards. </p>\n<p>Although you can never really plan some of these particular examples, situational generosity is easy enough when we just remember to say &#8220;yes.&#8221; By keeping an open mind and an open heart you will find the opportunities are endless. </p>\n", "post_id": 1584, "location": false, "date": "04-16-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["emotion", "alternate", "love", "cancer", "give", "age of aquarius", "gemini", "thanks", "selfishness", "alternative", "hate", "fear", "film", "astrology", "gratitude", "selfish", "story", "inheritance", "peace", "writing", "passion", "happiness", "remorse", "hope", "economy", "compassion", "joy", "aquarius", "judgement", "protection", "security", "loss", "receive", "freedom", "foolishness", "movies", "universe", "hatred", "balance", "greed", "generosity"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/441400-rip_open_insides.jpg\"><img src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/441400-rip_open_insides.jpg?w=306&#038;h=320\" alt=\"\" title=\"441400-rip_open_insides\" width=\"306\" height=\"320\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1639\" /></a></p>\n<p>As part of this week&#8217;s Generosity Challenge, I have decided to participate and post some examples of my own that I have accomplished this week.  One of the more difficult categories of the Generosity Challenge is performing one act of True Sharing.  I have performed two this week to use as examples.  The first act of True Sharing draws upon my passions and my skills.  True Sharing is recognizing what we have to offer our peers and giving it freely.  Since I am skilled in writing and passionate about freeing humanity from the shackles of greed, I have decided to share with you a petition that I have drafted.  In the spirit of Generosity I have also allowed my good friend Lesley free reign with editing my first draft.  True Sharing involves allowing others to participate in the act as well.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.change.org/petitions/the-united-nations-disassemble-all-governments-that-participate-in-our-economy-of-greed\">Sign the Petition Here!</a></p>\n<p>This Petition is written to the United Nations with the intention of informing them that we will no longer participate in an economy of Greed.  I would love to see how many signatures we are able to get.  Please, if you feel this petition is worthy, share it with as many people as you can!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.change.org/petitions/the-united-nations-disassemble-all-governments-that-participate-in-our-economy-of-greed\">Sign the Petition Here!</a></p>\n<p>For my second act of True Sharing I will be writing a letter to a good friend that lives here in Ottawa.  I have lost touch with her of late, and I know that she is a little annoyed with me for having done so.  She is a good friend of my parents and was an important part of my youth.  My second act of True Sharing will be my attempt to rekindle this relationship.</p>\n<p><em>My Dearest Friend,</p>\n<p>I write to you today because I realize it has been far too long since last I contacted you.  I would like you to know that you have been in my thoughts a lot recently and it is time that we spent some time together, as we once did.</p>\n<p>As far back as I can remember, hearing your name has always equaled a tickle of anticipation.  Saying that our friendship was unique would not surprise anyone.  To me, you were the adult that would dare to be a kid.  Yet I remember you would always tell me that I was the only kid that was adult enough to have the privilege to spend time with you.  I remember watching &#8220;Dirty Dancing&#8221; with you countless times in the basement, and re-enacting our favourite songs together.  I remember you would entrust me with gossip far beyond my years, but I would never tell.  I remember you washing my hair and teaching me how to deal with dandruff.  I remember long walks in the park with your dogs, finished off with a treat from McDonald&#8217;s.</p>\n<p>It makes me sad to think that our memories together may be finished.  I know that it is mostly my fault that we have not reconnected since I have moved to Ottawa.  I could offer excuses, but in the end the truth is that time rushes by and sometimes it is just easier to say nothing.  I realize that I no longer wish to lose people in my life.  Loving relationships were not meant to be ended.</p>\n<p>I would Love to try to rekindle our past friendship.  If you are interested, I am available this week and would Love to take you out for dinner.  Since I know you are rather skilled in the art of restauranteuring, I will leave the location to you.  Let me know if you are available!</p>\n<p>Yours through eternity,<br />\nTristan</em></p>\n", "post_id": 1586, "location": false, "date": "04-14-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["emotion", "gratitude", "Life", "love", "giving", "joy", "Loneliness", "philosophy", "upliftment", "Way Things Work", "alternative", "expression"], "text": "<p><em><strong>\u2018Life is an expression of Love to the never-ending Mind of All.\u2019</strong></em></p>\n<p>The above thought-form came into my consciousness \u2013 unbidden, as usual &#8212; just as I was waking from one of my typically bizarre dreams, one that involved my wife, some relatives I haven\u2019t seen in over 15 years, and a few people I didn\u2019t recognize at all.</p>\n<p>Later, after snoozing for a bit more, the idea of loneliness floated into my mind, in relation to all the people in our world that feel it on a daily basis. I felt it a little at this moment as well, and called in a pair of loving Guides/Companions/Assistants <a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/dark-forest.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft  wp-image-2052\" title=\"dark forest\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/dark-forest.jpg?w=175&#038;h=152\" alt=\"\" width=\"175\" height=\"152\" /></a>that I have for some conscious support and reassurance. It was nice. Our conversation was short, then they \u2018showed\u2019 me something about this state of being that made sense. . . . . . Loneliness is the blocking/incapacity to <em>express</em> Love, which is our most sacred \u2018activity\u2019 in the Universe. We tend to think of it as something very personal, very intimate, very \u2018individual\u2019. But it isn\u2019t really. Rather, it is wholly <strong>TRANS-personal</strong> in nature. We also tend to feel strongly that loneliness is a direct result of not <em>receiving</em> love, attention, companionship, etc. Based on my interaction this morning, it appears that the reality is just the opposite! The emotion we call loneliness is actually the failure or incapacity to <em>express or give love</em> to what we perceive as \u2018others\u2019. This is evidenced (to me) by the fact that I\u2019ve been in huge crowds of people, even at parties sometimes, but still felt lonely. Also, it is a fact that the highest incidences of bouts of loneliness (and suicide) occur during the \u2018holiday seasons\u2019, when families and friends typically come together to celebrate life. As far as I\u2019m concerned, this revelation feels spot on. How does it feel to you?</p>\n<p>Another thing that this perspective explains (again, to me at least) is the wonderful inner peace that I feel after writing and posting a new blog, one that I feel may help somebody \u2018out there\u2019 in my etheric global community in some nice way. How do you fellow writers/bloggers feel after you\u2019ve poured your heart out on your computer screen, and published a new post/article? Does the loneliness leave you, as it does me? Do you not feel more \u2018complete\u2019, content, fulfilled? For those of you who do not write for publication, doesn\u2019t it feel wonderful when you \u2018like\u2019 somebody\u2019s post, or leave a supportive comment? I feel that \u2018like\u2019ing another\u2019s sincere expressions of their life and perspective is actually another simple, and truly powerful, act of love. So, according to the info that came to me about The Way Things Work this morning (the mechanisms and methodology of operations in the 3D/4D matrix), it\u2019s logical that you should feel less lonely, less isolated, and more fulfilled when you show your appreciation by \u2018like\u2019ing other people\u2019s creations . . . . . right?</p>\n<p>This information also helps explain to me why cats and dogs are sooooooo powerful as pets and companions in dispelling loneliness, especially for single people. All one has to do is go pet your cat, or play with your dog, and you feel much better, much <a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/felino-w-hat-aug-08-4.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright  wp-image-2066\" title=\"Cat with a Hat\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/felino-w-hat-aug-08-4.jpg?w=157&#038;h=117\" alt=\"\" width=\"157\" height=\"117\" /></a>less lonely, no? Could it be that by expressing love to your pet you are unblocking your \u2018energetic pores\u2019, fulfilling once again your most fundamental divine calling (to express/manifest/expand Love), and thereby dispelling the dark clouds of loneliness in the process? Something to ponder &#8212; or better yet, to try!</p>\n<p>Final Note: I hope this helps, makes some sense to you, or at least gets you thinking about things, important things.

I am finding that I am beginning to overextend myself and it is time to start including others in this community. There are three areas that I feel are lacking and could use some help. They are relatively simple jobs, but they tend to get overlooked when I am busy trying to update the blog.</p>\n<p><strong>1: Twitter Administrator &#8211; Filled</strong></p>\n<p>Thank you <a href=\"http://mindmindful.wordpress.com\">MindMindful</a>!</p>\n<p><del datetime=\"2012-04-24T17:15:53+00:00\">I feel like my twitter account is pretty lame and doesn&#8217;t have many followers. I pretty much only tweet my new posts, so it is no wonder that it doesn&#8217;t have much of a following. Plus, I am not sure how you market twitter effectively. I would Love it if someone would take over the responsibility of posting daily tweets on the topic of Love and trying to promote the Alternate Economy&#8217;s twitter account. If you are interested, let me know in this comment thread.</del></p>\n<p><strong>2: Newsletter Administrator</strong></p>\n<p>I actually do have a newsletter list going, with a decent number of emails on it. I do not currently send out any newsletters, as those who are on the list may have noticed. I find there is just no time to get this organized. I would Love it if someone would take over the responsibility of writing a bi-weekly newsletter, featuring recent award winners, links to various related news articles and updates on the Experimental Farm. If you are interested in composing a bi-weekly newsletter for the Alternate Economy, let me know in this comment thread.</p>\n<p><strong>3: Promoter</strong></p>\n<p>The main goal of the Alternate Economy is spreading the word. The more time I spend at the experimental farm, the less time I have to promote this idea. I need someone who is willing to spend a few hours a week promoting the Alternate Economy by posting links back to this site on various related forums and blogs, etc. by leaving comments. This is NOT a SPAM job, but will require that you join some community sites and engage the members in a way that encourages them to visit our blog. If you are interested in promoting the Alternate Economy, let me know in this comment thread.</p>\n<p>I would like to thank you in advance. I really appreciate the help and I feel that it will only move this idea forward. We can all play a role in promoting the idea of Living in Love.

Even I, a man who is sure of most things, and has an opinion for everything, find that I am torn when it comes to the topic of polyamory. Polyamory is defined as the practice, desire, or acceptance of having more than one intimate relationship at a time with the knowledge and consent of everyone involved. On the surface this seems like it fits right in with the idea of Living in Love. But this topic goes far beyond the surface and the clean definition.</p>\n<p>Before we can talk about polyamory, first we should talk about consent. What exactly is consent? How do we know when we truly have it? When someone tells us we are permitted to do something, does that mean that they consent, or that they are permissive? Permissiveness, in my experience, does not equal consent&#8230; </p>\n<p>To read the rest of the post that I wrote for my friend Lesley, please visit her blog:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://sustainableutopia.wordpress.com/2012/04/11/themorethemerrier/\">Polyamory</a></p>\n<p>This post will not appear on my blog, so please go to <a href=\"http://sustainableutopia.wordpress.com/\">Sustainable Utopia</a> to read it!</p>\n<p>Congratulations again to Lesley on her successful completion of the Living in Love Challenge</p>\n", "post_id": 1631, "location": false, "date": "04-13-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["emotion", "love", "cancer", "give", "age of aquarius", "universal", "testing", "idea", "currency", "gemini", "thanks", "selfishness", "alternative", "education", "hate", "fear", "happiness", "astrology", "gratitude", "selfish", "inheritance", "employment", "discussion", "alternate", "religion", "remorse", "economy", "greatness", "passion", "hope", "2012", "unemployment", "absolute truth", "compassion", "joy", "aquarius", "judgement", "protection", "imagine", "security", "loss", "forum", "receive", "science", "foolishness", "conversation", "truth", "universe", "hatred", "balance", "greed", "generosity"], "text": "<div class=\"wpcom-reblog-snapshot\"><div class=\"reblogger-note\"><p class=\"reblogger-headline\"><img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/68568a91613f84935bce0f3371f2e5a9?s=32&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-32' height='32' width='32' /><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.wordpress.com/author/les1lesley/\">Lesley</a>:</p><div class='reblogger-note-content'><blockquote><p>I like new perspectives&#8230;</p>\n</blockquote></div></div><div class=\"reblog-post\"><p class=\"reblog-from\"><img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d270a27e857dbde704b1d2506e3685ce?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />Originally posted on <a href=\"http://mystiic.wordpress.com/2012/04/12/love-is-law-of-vibrational-expansion/\">M y s t i i c</a>:</p><div class=\"reblogged-content\">\n<p><span style=\"font-family:&#039;\">I am going to share with you today a very special piece from a very special blog\u2026 a space that has taught me much that I do know of life!! </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-family:&#039;\">Love, meant a word to me.

When we&#8217;re having a bad day, everything feels wrong and the day seems to get even worse as we sink further into frustration and despair. By the end of the day, all we want to do is pull the covers up over our heads and block it all out.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>When I clawed my way out of a depressive phase last year, it was a daily challenge to keep myself from falling back into that phase again. I had to go through a process of re-building my self-esteem and re-evaluating my life. But there were days when I was not very successful with these things and the negative thoughts that stayed with me for so long would interfere again.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>It sort of felt like climbing up and over a steep hill and every time I let a negative or discouraging thought sink in, my foot would slip and I would roll all the way back down to the bottom of the hill and have to start all over again.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>On the bad days, I would feel like it would never end and that I would always be unhappy.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>To achieve mental balance, I have to make a habit of reminding myself of a few important things that I think we all tend to forget when there is a black cloud looming over our heads.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><strong>1. Do not lose sight of what truly matters. </strong>Does that clogged sink signify the end of the world? Are you going to remember or even care that the stranger you smiled at in the coffee shop didn\u2019t smile back? When we\u2019re having a bad day, we seem to zoom in on petty things and complain about them. Next time you\u2019re pulling your hair out over something, ask yourself if it really matters.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><strong>2. It is okay to be alone or pull back from the world. </strong>Sometimes we just need to step back and re-evaluate a situation, a relationship, or just life in general. When I went through my <a title=\"\" href=\"http://www.mindbodygreen.com/tag/healing.html\">healing</a> period, I spent a lot of time alone as I tried to become my own best friend again. If you need to go into hiding for awhile and work on stitching yourself back up, take the time to do that. It is so important to pull back and spend quality time with yourself every now and then.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><strong>3. You are not always in control. </strong>You cannot predict when certain things will or should happen, or how everything will turn out. Sometimes you just have to stop pushing and let go.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><strong>4. What other people think is irrelevant. </strong>I was a miserable slave to the opinions of others. It got to a point where I was trying so hard to please everyone but myself. Don\u2019t let your immediate reaction to criticism be to change whatever it is you\u2019re being criticized for. Do whatever feels right to you, regardless of what other people have to say about it.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><strong>5. Don\u2019t give up.</strong> If you\u2019re fighting for something that means a lot to you, do not stop fighting whenever you happen to fall short. Remember why you are fighting for it.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><strong>6. You don\u2019t have to know all the answers.</strong> No one ever has life all figured out. We are always learning and growing. Life itself is a mystery and it\u2019s okay to feel clueless sometimes.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><strong>7. You are enough.</strong> All of us have had times in our lives where we have thought, \u201cI\u2019m not smart enough or pretty enough or strong enough or exciting enough to do _____.\u201d Give yourself a chance instead of forming limiting beliefs.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><strong>8. Stay present. </strong>Try not to <a title=\"\" href=\"http://www.mindbodygreen.com/0-3644/Marianne-Williamson-Dwell-in-the-Present.html\">dwell on the past</a>\u00a0or worry about the future. Take everything one day at a time.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><strong>9. Your feelings will not kill you.</strong> I know that heartbreak, grief, depression, or resentment might make you feel like you\u2019re dead and breathing, but you have the strength to get through whatever life throws at you. Hold on and see yourself through it.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><strong>10. You are human. </strong>This is probably the biggest reminder of them all. You will make mistakes. You will hurt other people and other people will hurt you. You won\u2019t always feel happy and positive. Next time you feel the urge to beat yourself up over any of these things, remind yourself that you are an imperfect human being instead.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div id=\"feature-date\">Published February 7, 2012 at 10:30 AM</div>\n<div id=\"authorimage\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/res.mindbodygreen.com/img/usr/Madison-sonnier-wc-160.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n<p>About <a href=\"http://www.mindbodygreen.com/wc/madison-sonnier\">Madison Sonnier</a><br />\nMadison Sonnier is a writer who has written for several online publications and is seeking connection and fulfillment.

Imagine a situation where a blind man is walking on a road using his stick as a tool to sense the surroundings. What do you think he uses his stick for? He continuously moves his stick right in front of his feet and checks if there\u2019s an obstacle lying ahead. Which senses are in action now? When the stick hits an obstacle, it vibrates slightly and the hit produces sound, so two senses are in action- touch and hearing. But do you think that his organs are actually responsible for such perception of the surrounding world? Think again! A blind person is unable to \u201csee\u201d his surroundings through his eyes, but using his senses of touch and hearing, it appears as if he can actually \u201csee\u201d the surroundings and thus react to it. Imagine another situation where you are sitting on a bench near the road side and waiting for bus or taxi. Now close your eyes for a few seconds and just try to hear the sound of vehicles passing by. You\u2019ll notice that the sound of the vehicles moving on road gives you an idea of the location of the vehicles. It seems as if you can actually \u201csee\u201d the vehicle moving, but not with your eyes this time. Now, how will you define perception? Is it simply using your \u2018dedicated\u2019 or \u2018specified\u2019 sense organs to understand the surrounding world and is it more than that or is there some other explanation that we haven\u2019t heard of or experienced yet? If perception simply means to use our sense organs, then how can we swap our sense organs in the way we want them to be? Or in other words, how can a blind \u201csee\u201d through his ears and hands; and how can we locate a vehicle by just hearing the sound it produces? These questions raised my curiosity and forced me to think over for their answers. And here\u2019s what I came forward with\u2026\u2026THE SINGLE EYE OF PERCEPTION.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">A 3-year old child is taught from the very beginning about his body parts and their fundamental functions\u2026\u2026eyes to see, nose to smell, tongue to taste, skin to feel, and ears to hear. But imagine a situation where a child is taught the unusual way, for example, eyes to hear and ears to see. What do you think will happen? Will the child start seeing with his ears or hear with his eyes? I bet he will! In the language of science, this will be termed \u201cevolution\u201d and will take millions of years to occur and that too only if the environment permits him to (survival of the fittest). But just think for a while; ignore the facts about evolution and just see the point I\u2019m trying to project here. Our brains are so na\u00efve and flexible that they can be moulded and deformed by our own will. If we are taught to live happily and positively right from our early childhood, we will grow, develop and become the same. I see perception having a single EYE which is differentiated into various organs of hearing, seeing, touching, feeling and smelling. In the world of absolute reality, that is, in the reality of SELF, there is just one EYE of perception (as I call it \u2018the third eye\u2019). This eye is not in our relative reality and is thus, not located physically where we can actually see it through our material eyes or sense it with other material senses. It is the eye of our CONSCIOUS, the eye of our SELF; that lies deep within in the garden of peace and covered by the fake realities of this material world. As long as we are unaware of it, we will be using our senses the way we were taught from our very childhood. But, if awakened (through meditation, etc.), we may use this wonderful master sense to perceive this surrounding world in its actual REAL form. We will be able to understand the various laws of nature in the way they were actually made and in the form they actually meant to be.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Think of it from a new direction. When we see through our eyes, what do we actually \u201csee\u201d? We see what we believe to be correct and we never deny or disagree to something that we see ourselves through our own material eyes. This fact dominates people all over the world that \u201cwhat\u2019s seen through the eyes can never be wrong, invalid or contradictory\u201d. Let me give you a practical example! Imagine a room filled with your favourite stuff and some stuff that is of no interest to you at all. You enter the room and you are asked to see all the stuff and then write them down on a page after you come out of the room. Will you be able to remember all the things? And even if you do, which list of items will you write first? Of course, your favourite ones! This is because your eyes see what you want them to see; your brain learns what you want it to learn; it\u2019s completely dependent on your \u201cwill\u201d or \u201cconscious\u201d. Your senses work in the way you want them to work. This is the part of absolute reality. We perceive our surrounding world with a single eye; the third eye or the eye of our conscious. And the power or the driving energy behind our perception is our BELIEF SYSTEM. What we believe, we perceive and what we perceive, we believe. So, according to me, perception may be redefined as \u201cTHE PROJECTION OF OUR BELIEFS IN FRONT OF OUR MATERIAL EYES AND REALIZATION OF REALITY INSIDE THE SINGLE EYE OF CONSCIOUS DRIVEN BY THE ENERGY DERIVED FROM OUR BELIEF SYSTEM\u201d. This is my belief and my way of perception towards perception!</p>\n", "post_id": 1648, "location": false, "date": "04-14-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["emotion", "joy", "peace", "art", "american friends", "family", "give", "best", "Lesley", "community", "imagination", "passion", "altecon", "alternate economey", "love", "Living in Love", "ae", "open", "sustainableutopia", "happiness", "true sharing", "selfish", "Life", "education", "food glorious food", "daring", "alternateeconomy", "conversation", "friends", "create", "alternate", "balanced emotions", "vacation", "Award", "vacation hot spots", "situational", "les1lesley", "greatness", "best friend", "8", "gratitude", "receiving", "humanity", "friend", "2012", "Lesley Pelletier", "belonging", "sharing", "positivity", "compassion", "healthy-living", "fun", "weight-loss", "radio show", "overt", "true", "take part", "8 Week Challenge", "The 8 Week Challenge", "join", "prize", "sustainability", "receive", "freedom", "challenge", "vulnerable", "together", "emotions", "generosity", "utopia", "comments section", "hope", "truth", "vulnerability", "sustainable", "security", "balance", "travel", "greed", "thanks"], "text": "<p>As part of her prize, MindMindful has shared this post with us.

Anytime I want to:)</p>\n<p>Some of the offerings are truly spot on &amp; resonate deeply, strongly. And this is one:</p>\n<p>The term maitri, loving-kindness, or even compassion, is generally rather sentimental &amp; weak in the English language. It has certain connotations connected with the popular concept of charity &amp; being kind to our neighbors. The real concept of maitri is different from that &#8230;&#8230;. maitri is not just being kind &amp; nice. It is the understanding that one has to become one with the situation &#8230;&#8230;. 0ne has to overcome the barrier that one has formed between oneself &amp; others. If you remove this barrier &amp; open yourself, then automatically real understanding &amp; clarity will develop in your mind.</p>\n<p>I think in our culture, or at least in the little slice of life in which I&#8217;ve learned by experience, being kind, charitable, etc is practiced as an act apart from ourselves. &lt;&gt; are kind to &lt;&gt; (Or, mostly, we are NOT&#8230;&#8230;) Charity, kindness is seen as being somehow separate from us, from The Way We Usually Are.</p>\n<p>I am increasingly understanding, though, more about how really being generous, kind, compassionate toward someone is being generous, kind, compassionate towards mySELF. And how it begins with treating myself this way. Rinpoche here is making it clear just how that is so: With no barrier between You &amp; Me, then any act of compassion is not &lt;&gt; &lt;&gt; It is, instead, &lt;&gt;. Who would not want that?!?!

And even then I did not tell them the real story&#8230;</p>\n<p>When I was travelling through Europe I spent a week in Scotland.\u00a0 I was travelling alone and was starting to run out of money.\u00a0 I arrived in\u00a0Inverness late in the evening, around dusk and was already concerned that I would not be able to afford a room in the hostel, even if it was available.\u00a0 Fate being what it is, an older gentleman approached me and asked if I had anywhere to stay that evening.\u00a0 He had a kind face, and appeared to be offering me a place to spend the night in town.</p>\n<p>Why we do not listen to the voice in our head, I will never understand.\u00a0 I have only heard this voice a few times, but every time I ignore it I always regret it.\u00a0 This time more so than others.</p>\n<p>The drive to his house was longer than I would have liked.\u00a0 He lived in a cottage on the outskirts of town.\u00a0 I learned he was renting it for the week.\u00a0 I had no idea where we were by the time the car pulled into the laneway.\u00a0 I was a foreigner in an unknown city.</p>\n<p>Upon arriving, my new friend offered me a drink which I accepted.\u00a0\u00a0I do not know if it is because I was nervous, or\u00a0because the drinks were spiked, but I have never been so intoxicated before or since.</p>\n<p>The rest of the details are uneccesary, save to say that I did not enjoy the rest of the evening.\u00a0 I have memories of being dressed in a kilt and photographs being taken.\u00a0 I remember locking myself in the bathroom until it became obvious that this would not stop him.</p>\n<p>I remember asking to be driven to the train station the next morning.\u00a0 My train was at 6:00pm but I told him it was at 9:00am.\u00a0 I remember sitting in the train station and crying for 9 hours.</p>\n<p>This event changed my life considerably.\u00a0 At first I felt it was all my fault.\u00a0 How incredibly stupid of a thing to do!\u00a0 I felt so much shame.\u00a0 Shame for getting in his car.\u00a0 Shame for staying the night.\u00a0 Shame for not fighting more.\u00a0 Shame for leaving the bathroom willingly.</p>\n<p>Then something in me changed.\u00a0 I started to realize that nothing in my life had actually changed.\u00a0 Except for my new feelings of worthlessness.\u00a0 I had never felt worthless before.\u00a0 What was different now?\u00a0 Did I do something wrong that night?\u00a0 Was it really my fault?</p>\n<p>Of course not.\u00a0 I probably should not have accepted his offer.\u00a0 I probably should have listened to the voice inside my head.\u00a0 But I did not do anything wrong.\u00a0 He did.</p>\n<p>I am love.\u00a0 I deserve to be loved.\u00a0 I deserved it before being raped and I still deserve it afterwards.</p>\n<p>Since this event a lot has happened to me.\u00a0 I have become so much stronger.\u00a0 I have lived in shame, but I am tired of that now.\u00a0 I don&#8217;t know why I feel compelled to share this story with all of you.\u00a0 Perhaps it is so that you will see that this blog was not written by someone who has lived the perfect life.\u00a0 This blog is written by someone who has suffered.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But through my suffering I have come to see how incredibly lucky I am.\u00a0 That night was a nightmare, but it was only one night.\u00a0 It is over and never has to happen again, so long as I listen to the voice in my head next time&#8230;\u00a0 Does that mean that I should stop trusting in humanity?\u00a0 Does that mean I should block the love from my life from this point forward?</p>\n<p>I can&#8217;t do that.\u00a0 I will not.\u00a0 I forgive myself for getting in his car that night.\u00a0 I forgive myself for not fighting back more.\u00a0 In the end I was not hurt physically, at least not as badly as I could have been.\u00a0 Perhaps if I had fought back I would have been.\u00a0 I forgive myself for being raped.</p>\n<p>I also forgive my rapist.\u00a0 He wasn&#8217;t really that terrible of a person.\u00a0 We talked for quite a while that night before it all happened.\u00a0 He is a school teacher, which makes me nervous.\u00a0 He did not hurt me.\u00a0 He asked me about my life.\u00a0 He looked at me with love in his eyes.\u00a0 But he was very wounded.\u00a0 Incredibly wounded.\u00a0 His wounds are far more severe than mine, if he is prowling around train stations looking for young men.\u00a0 He is trying to live in love, but is doing so in an incredibly selfish way.\u00a0 His passions are very unbalanced and leads only to hatred in his victims.</p>\n<p>But only if his &#8220;victims&#8221;

Visit this post to find out the particulars, but basically it involves mining your own mind, heart, life for how you respond to &amp; live with each week&#8217;s subject. This 1st week: Generosity, broken down into 3 categories. First, let me say: I&#8217;m disregarding the 3 categories, altogether, ha! Doing what you can with what you have, when you can, for the benefit of others: that&#8217;s the overriding principal, I feel. Plus, I&#8217;m working with Generosity from a Buddhist point of view.</p>\n<p>In <a title=\"Theravada\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theravada\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">Theravadan Buddhism</a>, there are Teachings known as the Six <a title=\"P\u0101ramit\u0101\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C4%81ramit%C4%81\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">Paramitas</a>. Paramita is variously translated as <a title=\"Paramitas\" href=\"http://www.naljorprisondharmaservice.org/pdf/SixParamitas.htm\">&#8220;perfection, perfect realization, or reaching beyond limitation&#8221;. </a>It is in working with &#8220;reaching beyond limitation&#8221; that I feel I have been most challenged, &amp; where most of my personal growth in Generosity has happened. These &#8220;perfections&#8221;, virtuous attainments also translate as &#8220;crossing over to the other shore&#8221;, referring to <a title=\"Samsara\" href=\"en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsara_(Jainism)\">samsara</a>, the world filled with sufferings in which we live. What &#8220;going across&#8221; means here is moving toward Awakening, the realization of one&#8217;s inherent &#8212; already present &#8212; <a title=\"Buddha-nature\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddha-nature\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">Buddha Nature</a>, &amp; reaching <a title=\"Bodhisattva\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhisattva\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">Bodhisattva</a>-hood. Though these qualities ARE already within each of us, they are obscured\u00a0by our ignorance of awakening, by our accepting the collective delusion of This World We Live In, &#8220;the ocean of samsara.&#8221; Akin perhaps to the 7 Virtues of Catholic teachings, which aid you on your journey to eternal Heaven, the paramitas\u00a0are the sturdy little boats that we can sail in to keep from drowning in this ocean. &#8216;Generosity&#8217; is one of the Paramitas, &amp; I muse upon this a great deal. Cultivating a generous spirit has taken me far, far from the angry, grasping woman I used to be. I am not nearly so self-absorbed, as I am becoming ever-more aware of other people&#8217;s needs. And, I must also admit: Yikes, I have so so far yet to go!!<img title=\"More...\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/mindmindful.wordpress.com/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>I try to give of myself, whenever I see someone needing a hand, or a laugh, or an affirmation of hope. I pick up after the dogs, when they &#8216;do their business&#8217; which is my diligent gift to the community. When I have extra income, I mostly donate to non-profits that deal with planting trees, animal welfare, &amp; service dogs. Yet, one form of Generosity which most definitely goes unseen is in the way I am (working on) training my silly, feeble mind to &#8220;not go there&#8221;. What I mean is this: When I&#8217;m about to put silent words to a judgmental or hateful thought, I sometimes am able to stop myself. Though this is only happening in my mind, it makes for a little less snarkiness\u00a0in the world, &amp; for fewer acts of division, all those ways in which I/We create &amp; defend a paradigm of US vs THEM. But BECAUSE this is only happening in my mind, it is creating that wee\u00a0space between the stimulus (whatever it is) &amp; my response (which, if unattended, is largely a knee-jerk reaction based on deeply held, unexamined beliefs). And in that little slice of space-time, that bitty pause, there is more room for Love. Love has time to emerge, which edges out a little bit of Hate, Division, Judgment, &amp; thus one tiny chink is made in the barriers between ME &amp; YOU.</p>\n<p>This is not visible to others, &amp; it&#8217;s perhaps an act of omission, more than commission. And who gives you points for what you DON&#8217;T do, &amp; what ISN&#8217;T seen?? haha **Sigh** There&#8217;s no reward, &amp; in keeping with my goal of Attaining Bodhisattva-hood sometime in the next several millenia, I am to ask for none. THIS part is hard, as the smallness within my soul wants to be\u00a0recognized for doing this! My ego wants to be built up, aggrandized, celebrated for Doing Good Works, which is, of course, directly contradicting of efforts at Living in unconditional Love, haha</p>\n<p>Just before I learned of the 8 Week Challenge, I was watching &#8220;<a title=\"Tea with Mussolini\" href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120857/\" rel=\"imdb\" target=\"_blank\">Tea With Mussolini</a>&#8220;, which is a wonderful movie, with powerful themes of conditioned expectations of Generosity, &amp; unconditional gifts of it also. Great kindnesses are both openly given, &amp; kept secret, which strongly exemplify a quote from Shakespeare that moves through the story: &#8220;Love thyself last&#8221;. This, I believe perfectly illustrates the highest expression of Generosity, which is also one way of understanding this Paramita: Giving of oneself.</p>\n<p>So, I have a far distance to travel, yes, before I have crossed samsara &amp; reached the other shore of Enlightened being. But, travel I shall.</p>\n<h6>Related articles</h6>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://ralphiesportal.me/2012/04/09/7731/\" target=\"_blank\">Week 1: Generosity</a> (ralphiesportal.me)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.wordpress.com/2012/04/11/overt-generosity/\" target=\"_blank\">OVERT Generosity</a> (alternateeconomy.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://mindmindful.wordpress.com/2012/03/16/when-giving-creates-more/\" target=\"_blank\">When giving creates more &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..</a> (mindmindful.wordpress.com)</li>\n</ul>\n", "post_id": 1684, "location": false, "date": "04-15-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["emotion", "love", "cancer", "give", "age of aquarius", "universal", "testing", "idea", "currency", "gemini", "thanks", "selfishness", "alternative", "education", "hate", "fear", "happiness", "astrology", "gratitude", "selfish", "inheritance", "employment", "discussion", "alternate", "religion", "remorse", "economy", "greatness", "passion", "hope", "2012", "unemployment", "absolute truth", "compassion", "joy", "aquarius", "judgement", "happy new year", "protection", "imagine", "security", "loss", "forum", "receive", "science", "foolishness", "conversation", "truth", "universe", "hatred", "balance", "greed", "generosity"], "text": "<p>In this video I go into a description of why I think we should form our own bank, in order to manipulate the current laws which allow banks to literally create money out of thin air.

They all feel pain and suffering.  They all wish for greater things.  They all have passions and Lovers and desires.  They all have a life they wish they could be living.  Living in Compassion is recognizing that we should always be treating others the way that we ourselves would want to be treated.  If we would not want to be told we have a weird nose, then we should not tell someone else they have a weird nose.  Even if it is followed by a giggle and a &#8220;just teasing&#8221;.  These little comments still hurt.</p>\n<p>When directed outwardly we see that charity arises not so much from Generosity, but rather from Compassion.  The donations that help support charities are definitely acts of Generosity.  But charitable <em>work</em> itself is actually Compassion.  For charitable work arises from the need to help those less fortunate than yourself.  To help raise them up to stand tall with you.  It comes from a lack of judgment and a willingness to offer a helping hand in times of need.</p>\n<p>But most of all Compassion comes from a willingness to forgive yourself your transgressions.  We all make mistakes.  Some more terrible than others.  But we must be willing to accept those mistakes for what they are; lessons.  Once we see how our mistakes (and every decision we make) has shaped our lives, we begin to see that it was all part of the process.  Assuming we do not repeat our mistakes, we deserve to be forgiven.  For we would not be the person we are today, had we not made them.  Compassion directed outwardly must first start with inwardly directed forgiveness.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/badge.jpg\"><img src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/badge.jpg?w=300&#038;h=300\" alt=\"\" title=\"badge\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1497\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>This Weeks Challenge</strong></p>\n<p>The literal definition of Compassion from Merriam Webster is: &#8220;a sympathetic consciousness of others&#8217; distress together with a desire to alleviate it&#8221;, but Compassion is so much more than an academic definition. To be truly Compassionate, you have to have more than a desire to alleviate the distresses of others, you have to be willing to approach all of humanity without judgement.  For some people, this challenge will be a walk in the park, for others, especially those who have probably been judged unfavourably in the past, making the switch to Compassionate thinking will be a harder pill to swallow.  The purpose of this challenge is to guide your mind to make the switch from automatically looking at the world with judgment, to looking at it with Compassion.</p>\n<p>The following examples are suggestions only.

We are who we are, because of the lessons we have encountered and the way we have reacted to them.  But today is a new day, and the past is the past. Inward Compassion is non-judgment directed towards yourself.  This is not to say that you should act without morals and then simply forgive yourself repeatedly afterwards.  But once you have decided to Live in Love, you must be able to truly forgive yourself for the mistakes that have brought you to where you are today.  Without those mistakes, you would never have taken this challenge.  What else would you have missed?  For this week, please take the time to write about how your life is exactly as it should be and each decision has brought you to nowhere else but this one inevitable place in life.  Write about how you accept this place you find yourself and how you do not judge yourself for ending up here.</p>\n<p><strong>Inward Compassion</strong><br />\n&#8211;       Sit and meditate on the various crossroads you have reached up until this point in your life.  Come to learn how the decisions you have made have formed who you are, and to accept that it is a good thing.<br />\n&#8211;\tStop watching/reading media outlets that produce material you find negative and disrespectful to humanity. The main goal of most mainstream media is to make people judge each other and put themselves into constant competition with their equals, and that never leads to Compassion. Find an unbiased source for current events that hasn&#8217;t turned into &#8220;infotainment&#8221;.<br />\n&#8211;\tTry to become more in tune with your inner dialogue. When you find yourself having negative thoughts (eg- &#8220;I feel fat today&#8221;) immediately replace it with a positive one (eg- &#8220;I&#8217;m so curvy/cuddly&#8221;)</p>\n<table width=\"150\" border=\"1\" bgcolor=\"#99ccff\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;\" align=\"center\"><a href=\"alternateeconomy.wordpress.com/2012/04/23/outward-compassion/\">Outward Compassion</a></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Outward Compassion can be easily confused with Generosity.  This is mostly due to the fact that most people&#8217;s struggles revolve around access to resources.  But Compassion is more about looking at a situation and seeing how you would want to be treated in that scenario and then acting accordingly.  In Generosity we give freely to everyone, because we have things to give.  In Compassion we give freely to those who need us because we know that if we were in that situation, we would need a helping hand as well.  Take the time to perform one act of Outward Compassion this week and write about it.</p>\n<p><strong>Outward Compassion</strong><br />\n&#8211;       Take time to help the sick, aging and lonely digest their lives. Ask them questions and truly listen to their answers.  Come to know them intimately and you will see you are not so different, only from different pasts.<br />\n&#8211;\tWrite letters to prison inmates, helping them to understand that there is another way. How will they ever be rehabilitated or expected to have respect for humanity if humanity never shows them Compassion?<br />\n&#8211;\tChallenge someone to a debate, and take a side that you personally don&#8217;t agree with. (eg: debate on behalf of Mao&#8217;s Revolution in China) This one won&#8217;t be easy, but it allows you to put yourself into someone else&#8217;s shoes, and while you may never agree with their actions, you can still have Compassion for them.</p>\n<table width=\"150\" border=\"1\" bgcolor=\"#99ccff\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;\" align=\"center\"><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.wordpress.com/2012/05/19/forgiveness-dialogue/\">Forgiveness Dialogue</a></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>This section of the challenge centers around changing our inner dialogue. Forgiveness is a state of mind.  It is an understanding that nobody can hurt you, but yourself.  When we allow ourselves to fall into judgment, our inner dialogue becomes very cynical and even down right abusive.  By drawing your attention to the things you are <em>thinking</em> you can start to catch yourself and change that first negative response that sometimes seems so natural.  It is not, in fact, natural, merely habitual.  It is possible to change your habits.  For this week, please keep a journal of judgmental thoughts you have had throughout the week.  Be honest with yourself and try to be as aware as possible.

The evolution of one&#8217;s intellect, views, mindset is a mark of growth, &amp; I understand now that rigidity &amp; staunchness are detrimental to that growth.

If you search for it, you will find countless books and writings upon the subject. It seems that this topic has fascinated humanity for the past two thousand years.  What has compassion evolved into since? Has the concept of compassion evolved, or is it an essential thought, with the same meaning today as it had back during the Roman Empire. It would be wise to first look at its opposite expression; judgment. Judgment causes individuals to evaluate the people in their lives based upon certain criteria, and assign them into categories based upon this evaluation. These categories imply that our lives have different value. Those who are judged less worthy are assigned lives which are less valuable and therefore the suffering caused upon them is less important. Judgment creates selfishness. When we look at the world through judgmental eyes, we naturally assign ourselves a high ranking of value. We value ourselves, so others should as well. If our feeling of self-worth is reinforced by those around us who also live in judgment, we will begin to feel justified in our feelings of superiority. Selfishness arises when you feel that you are separate and somehow more worthy than others around you. Because you are worth more, you deserve to have more.</p>\n<p>If our feeling of self-worth is not reinforced by those around us, but we are instead judged consistently to be inferior, we will begin to adopt a feeling of worthlessness. Again, selfishness has an opportunity to enter. Because we no longer feel worthy of our lives, we begin to wallow in self-pity. We no longer attempt to act like a valuable person. We are selfish, because we are now hiding our true self from the world. Instead of pressing forward and attempting to contribute, we hang back on the sidelines, awaiting instructions from our superiors and ceasing to truly live. Or we engage in manipulation to attempt to drag others down with us. Either way, we are selfish because the gift of life we were given has been wasted on self-pity.</p>\n<p>Judgment assumes that humans are not born equal, but are in fact all different. Some are born geniuses, others are born morons, some are destined for greatness, others to become criminals. Judgment is a wounded emotion, because it stems from selfishness. Whether you feel that you are worthy or worthless, when you approach the question with judgment you are focused only on the negative aspects of yourself. Whether you are proud of how few you have or horrified with how many, in both scenarios your sight is pointed inwards in a critical way.</p>\n<p>Compassion is the opposite expression of emotion. When we live our lives with compassion, we see all around us as our equals. Because they are our equals, we do not expect them to be perfect. Just as we know that we are not perfect. When we approach a situation with compassion, we place ourselves inside the &#8220;shoes&#8221; of the other and attempt to see things from their perspective. If we have learned anything about their past at all, then their actions are usually completely understandable, if not justifiable. Compassion is realizing that all humans make mistakes. In judgment we assume that every mistake a person makes somehow makes them less valuable. In compassion we understand that every mistake a person makes allows them to learn and therefore makes them stronger. When our friends falter and we live in judgment, we relish in their failures because it has somehow raised our ranking. When our friends falter and we live in compassion, we offer our support and attempt to help our friends learn as much from their mistake as possible. Compassion leads to gratitude. Now that our friends know that we will always be there for them when they screw up, they cannot help but feel compassion towards us when we falter. Now we no longer need to think selfishly about whether or not our mistakes will make us a better or worse person. Now we are able to have confidence that when we make mistakes, we are just like everyone else.</p>\n<p>Compassion is cyclical, as is judgment. When we live in judgment, our decisions create judgment, which in turn leads to selfishness and self-pity, which causes us to judge the next decision more harshly. When we extend compassion to others, decisions create a sense of support, which in turn creates gratitude, which allows us to be confident that we will receive support in our decisions. A new cycle.</p>\n<p>Judgment is a wounded emotion. We judge because we have been judged. It matters little whether we were judged to be superior or inferior. When we are judged we are forced to become selfish, constantly evaluating the outcome of every decision. Measuring ourselves constantly against others. Even when we feel we are superior to those around us, it is a negative superiority, because it implies others are inferior. There is no balance in judgment, therefore there is no love.</p>\n<p>Compassion is a healthy emotion. We extend compassion because we are confident in our ability to make mistakes and still be a good person afterwards. If we can make mistakes and not truly change, then why would others change when they make mistakes? When we live in compassion, even when we feel like we screwed up, we are able to take our mistake and turn it into a lesson. This allows us to grow and become a better person. The more we do this, the more confident we become in our ability to love. Now, instead of judging ourselves, we concentrate on planning our decisions by controlling our emotions, so as not to repeat our mistakes. We introduce balance into our lives, as we assess each success and failure individually. The more we learn through compassion, the less we find that we are making mistakes. Compassion leads to balanced emotions which leads to Love.</p>\n<p>Read Next:</p>\n<table width=\"250\" border=\"1\" bgcolor=\"#99ccff\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://alternate-economy.com/wordpress/blog/2012/01/01/hope/\">Hope</a>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.alternate-economy.com\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.alternate-economy.com/Images/banner-alternate-economy.jpg\" alt=\"The Alternate Economy\" width=\"450\"></a></p>\n", "post_id": 1738, "location": false, "date": "04-19-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["emotion", "joy", "peace", "art", "american friends", "family", "give", "best", "Lesley", "community", "imagination", "passion", "altecon", "alternate economey", "love", "Living in Love", "ae", "open", "sustainableutopia", "happiness", "true sharing", "selfish", "Life", "education", "food glorious food", "daring", "alternateeconomy", "conversation", "friends", "create", "alternate", "balanced emotions", "vacation", "Award", "vacation hot spots", "situational", "les1lesley", "greatness", "best friend", "8", "gratitude", "receiving", "humanity", "friend", "2012", "Lesley Pelletier", "belonging", "sharing", "positivity", "compassion", "healthy-living", "fun", "weight-loss", "radio show", "overt", "true", "take part", "8 Week Challenge", "The 8 Week Challenge", "join", "prize", "sustainability", "receive", "freedom", "challenge", "vulnerable", "together", "emotions", "generosity", "utopia", "comments section", "hope", "truth", "vulnerability", "sustainable", "security", "balance", "travel", "greed", "thanks"], "text": "<p><em>As my example of inward compassion I will in fact be posting a copy of a document I wrote while writing the &#8220;Quest for Truth&#8221; series.

Do I think that I am the messiah, or the next ascended master? Of course not. I am just a man.</p>\n<p>I have lived a life. Not a particularly long one, but one that is very representative of the Age of Aquarius. Through the lessons of Karma I have come full circle and realized that all of the pain in my life is my own doing.</p>\n<p>I have been involved in six sexual relationships so far in my life. These six women would be represented as the loves of my life.</p>\n<p>In my first relationship I was quite young. I starting dating a woman of spectacular intelligence and grace. But she had a daughter. Not my daughter, another man\u2019s. In this relationship I was living in a wounded state and it did not survive. I lived in greed at this point and I was unable to allow my love to blossom. The resource I was greedy about was time. I was never jealous of her daughter. But I did resent her. I resented the time she took from my life. I was in my first year of university and trying to make new friends, but I was also spending most of my time with my lover\u2019s daughter. Instead of choosing to embrace this time spent with a beautiful young mind, I choose to become selfish and resent the time I \u201cwasted\u201d with her daughter. Ultimately, I rejected my lover out of greed.</p>\n<p>When I entered my second relationship I was now wounded from the first. But this time it was because I had come to realize that I had pushed a true love away with my foolishness. Now I was wounded in a new way. Now I was living in remorse. When I entered this relationship, I entered into it with someone who I knew I could not succeed with. Because I felt that I did not deserve to be loved, I chose someone who would oblige me. She was a foreign exchange student and two months away from returning to Germany forever. I literally followed her around the globe in my remorse, but this only caused her to reject me. I was not following her for love, but rather to lengthen the pain. Ultimately, my lover rejected me over remorse.</p>\n<p>When I entered my third relationship I was wounded further still from the previous one. But this time it was because I felt rejected. I would not allow this pain to enter my life again. It was a good year in between these relationships. During this time I externalized my wounds again and started to live in judgment. I began dating a very nice and enthusiastic girl. She was infatuated with me, but I knew that I was her first real boyfriend. In judgment I saw her enthusiasm as inexperience. It soon began to grate on my nerves. If she liked me that much there must be something wrong with her. I literally broke up with her because her smell became too much for me to bear. How much more judgmental of a reason could there be to end a relationship? Ultimately, I rejected my lover out of judgment.</p>\n<p>When I entered my fourth relationship I was wounded further still from the previous one. But this time it was because I felt ashamed. I knew that I had acted inappropriately in my last relationship. There was another considerable gap between these relationships. During this time I internalized my wounds once more and started to live in hatred. At this point I started to date a woman of intoxicating beauty. But she was also quite wounded. She had many issues surrounding her sexuality. But my main attraction to her was her sexuality. So we fought and fought and fought. Our relationship was passion in the most unbalanced sense. In the end we hated each other more than we loved each other. On Christmas Eve she told me that she had met someone else. After two years together I had driven her to hate me as much as I hated myself. Ultimately, my lover rejected me over hatred.</p>\n<p>When I entered my fifth relationship I was wounded further still from the previous one. But this time it was because I felt betrayed. I did not do the greatest job at learning my lesson after this relationship. Instead I became fearful of love in general. With so many failures and my last relationship ending in such a traumatic way I began to live in fear. It took me two years to find my next girlfriend. I started to date a woman who was genuinely affectionate and truly cared for me. But I was blind to see it until it was over. What I saw was that she lived in another city. It was only 4 hours drive away, and her family lived back here, so there was no reason to really think it could not have worked. But I had already been in a long distance relationship. And it was the one where I felt the most remorse. In my fear I saw only my previous relationship and could not see my current one. Ultimately, I rejected my lover out of fear.</p>\n<p>When I entered my sixth and final relationship I was wounded further still from the previous one. But this time it was because I felt like I would never figure love out. I started dating a girl quite quickly after my fifth relationship. She was much younger than me and not at all interested in being in a relationship with anyone. She enjoyed her freedom, but I managed to convince her to date me by showering her with affection. At this point I was living in loss. Because I was expecting the relationship to fail from its start, I overcompensated by throwing every gift I could imagine at my new girlfriend. I would prove to her that I was worth sticking with, if it killed me. But in the end, my overbearing affection only pushed her away. By expecting to lose her, I got just what I expected. Ultimately, my lover rejected me over my feelings of loss.</p>\n<p>While this story was playing itself out I had no idea what was going on. It is only by looking back over my life with a spirit of Compassion that the pieces of the puzzle begin to fit together. This is Karma. My life is both incredibly complex, yet incredibly simple. In my youth I was greedy which caused me to express my woundedness outwardly. I rejected my lover. When I started to realize that this was a mistake I entered remorse, expressing my woundedness inwardly. My next lover rejected me because I lived in remorse. After being rejected for the first time, I decided to avoid that pain again. This caused me to become judgmental of my next partner, expressing my woundedness outwardly again. I rejected her as well. After doing this I felt guilty which caused me to express my woundedness inwardly once more. Now I was living in hatred. My next lover rejected me because I spread my hate to her. This caused me to become fearful of relationships in general. I met someone who actually really liked me, but this relationship only lasted a few months. I was now expressing my woundedness outwardly, so I rejected her. With so many failures behind me I started to think that maybe I would never find true love, so I expressed my woundedness inwardly and began to live in loss. Then I meet someone that I really like, so I begin to smother them in the hopes that they will not leave me. My lover rejects me because I push her away.</p>\n<p>The lesson of my life is that love cannot exist if any of the emotions are wounded. It requires all six aspects of emotion to exist in the healthy state for true love to manifest. In order to experience true love we must live in generosity, compassion, hope, passion, the spirit of receiving and joy. It takes all six to live a balanced healthy loving life.</p>\n<p>I am currently single. It has only been a few months since my last relationship where I lived in loss. What I am coming to learn is that true love is something that comes from within me. When I balance my emotions, true love will start to appear everywhere. It doesn\u2019t matter if I never date again. I know that now that I have healed all of the aspects of my emotions I will receive love everywhere I go. The universe simply mirrors what we project. If I am love, then all around me will love me.</p>\n<p>I am not special, or different than anyone else. All that I have done is calm my soul and take the time to listen. I knew there was a lesson to learn. An idea was beginning to form in my mind. It turns out thinking did little to help. It was only by listening that the pieces began to fit together. The universe wants us to learn these things. The Alternate Economy is simply an idea, come full circle.</p>\n<p>The story that I have related to you is an incredibly personal one and you may be wondering why I felt it was necessary to share it with you. At first I thought that the Alternate Economy would equal change at the community level which then filtered down to the personal level. I am coming to realize that this is the selfish stance. It implies that we do not ourselves have to change. What I have come to realize is that the Alternate Economy will only succeed if there is change at the personal level. This change will then filter up to the community level, not the other way around. The Alternate Economy is about TRUE change. True change is a personal story of growth and learning. True change starts with One Life.</p>\n", "post_id": 1742, "location": false, "date": "04-20-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["emotion", "joy", "peace", "art", "american friends", "family", "give", "best", "Lesley", "community", "imagination", "passion", "altecon", "alternate economey", "love", "Living in Love", "ae", "open", "sustainableutopia", "happiness", "true sharing", "selfish", "Life", "education", "food glorious food", "daring", "alternateeconomy", "conversation", "friends", "create", "alternate", "balanced emotions", "vacation", "Award", "vacation hot spots", "situational", "les1lesley", "greatness", "best friend", "8", "gratitude", "receiving", "humanity", "friend", "2012", "Lesley Pelletier", "belonging", "sharing", "positivity", "compassion", "healthy-living", "fun", "weight-loss", "radio show", "overt", "true", "take part", "8 Week Challenge", "The 8 Week Challenge", "join", "prize", "sustainability", "receive", "freedom", "challenge", "vulnerable", "together", "emotions", "generosity", "utopia", "comments section", "hope", "truth", "vulnerability", "sustainable", "security", "balance", "travel", "greed", "thanks"], "text": "<p><em><small>For my essay on Inward Compassion for the<a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.wordpress.com/2012/04/07/the-8-week-challenge/\"> 8 Week Challenge</a>, I&#8217;m presenting you with this revised version of one of my earliest posts about my struggle with Anorexia.

I hide the food I eat, I lie about what I eat, and I tell everyone that my weight is a medical issue. I know it&#8217;s not. I know that I eat too much, and don&#8217;t exercise enough. All I think about is food. <em>When can I eat? Where will I eat? What&#8217;s for dessert? Have we run out of chocolate?</em> It&#8217;s forefront on my mind nearly 100% of the time. It&#8217;s torture, and it&#8217;s ruining my life.</p>\n<p><em>It&#8217;s just a little extra weight, how can you let it control your life?</em></p>\n<p><em></em>Well, to understand my issues with food <em>now</em>, we should probably go back to the beginning.</p>\n<p>When I was three months old, I developed tonsillitis. I was treated with antibiotics. I got better. A few weeks later, the tonsillitis came back. More antibiotics, got better.\u00a0 A couple of months went by, and then, you guessed it, swollen tonsils strike again.\u00a0 This cycle continued for years. Multiple bouts of sickness treated with course after course of antibiotics, not to mention endless hours in the hospital. The tonsils had to come out, but I wasn&#8217;t big enough for the surgery. My throat hurt, so I didn&#8217;t eat, and I didn&#8217;t grow big enough for the surgery.\u00a0 I was seven years old before I was big enough to have them removed.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, I was a tiny child. Small and sickly. After my surgery, things changed. I discovered food. Glorious food. I indulged, and no one stopped me. After years of trying to force in just one bite, I suddenly was able to devour any and everything set in front of me. I became robust, then plump&#8230;. then chubby.</p>\n<p>Then fat.</p>\n<p>By the time I hit puberty I was carrying more than my share of pounds. It didn&#8217;t effect me emotionally though. At least, not until all of my friends started getting boyfriends, and I was just &#8220;one of the boys&#8221;. When I looked around and saw that all the girls with boyfriends were thin and pretty, something clicked in me.\u00a0 Or rather, it broke.</p>\n<p>So began my life as an anorexic. I didn&#8217;t know that&#8217;s what I was, but I was one all the same. In the early days, it wasn&#8217;t so severe. Skip a few lunches, ride my bike a bit more. It didn&#8217;t have complete control over my life. When I graduated from elementary school, I was thin and pretty, just what I was striving for.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://sustainableutopia.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/skinny2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft\" title=\"Me and my Brother\" src=\"https://sustainableutopia.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/skinny2.jpg?w=300&#038;h=297\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"297\" /></a>And for a while, that was enough.\u00a0 I maintained &#8220;thin and pretty&#8221; for a while. I had lots of boyfriends, lots of friends, high school was awesome. I was a bit obsessive about counting calories, but I was mostly healthy.</p>\n<p>Then there was this boy (isn&#8217;t there always?). I really liked him, but it was unrequited. That&#8217;s tough for a kid. For me, he was perfection. Unfortunately, I wasn&#8217;t his type. He told me that he like his girls &#8220;anorexicly&#8221; skinny, which I was not. That was my tipping point.</p>\n<p>Forget calorie restriction, I employed calorie annihilation. I got down to a couple of crackers a day. By the time I was 16 I was no longer &#8220;thin and pretty&#8221;. I was bones.\u00a0 He still didn&#8217;t want me.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://sustainableutopia.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/skinny.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright\" title=\"skinny\" src=\"https://sustainableutopia.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/skinny.jpg?w=300&#038;h=250\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"250\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://sustainableutopia.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/normal.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft\" title=\"normal\" src=\"https://sustainableutopia.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/normal.jpg?w=300&#038;h=195\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"195\" /></a>I&#8217;m not really sure how thin I would have gotten. That year my Dad got transferred, and my family moved six hours away.\u00a0 In hindsight, it was the best thing that could have happened.</p>\n<p>Removed from daily contact with the catalyst for my disorder, I became less rigid about abstaining from food.\u00a0 Within a few months I was back to &#8220;thin and pretty&#8221;. I wasn&#8217;t healthy though, not by a long shot. For the next two years I was up and down, emotionally and physically. Sometimes I would binge, and then spend the next several weeks &#8220;making up for it&#8221; by restricting calories and over-exercising.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://sustainableutopia.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/us.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright\" title=\"us\" src=\"https://sustainableutopia.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/us.jpg?w=300&#038;h=208\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"208\" /></a></p>\n<p>The cycle probably would have gone on forever, if it hadn&#8217;t been for a boy (didn&#8217;t I say there was always one of those?) This was a good one though. If he hadn&#8217;t started to notice, and I hadn&#8217;t been embarrassed about it, nothing ever would have changed.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://sustainableutopia.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/fatwedding.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft\" title=\"fatwedding\" src=\"https://sustainableutopia.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/fatwedding.jpg?w=174&#038;h=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"174\" height=\"300\" /></a>I started to get better. I stopped counting calories, I put on some weight. I stopped thinking about food. In fact, eating became mindless.\u00a0 College came and went, but the 50 or so pounds I gained stuck around. I married the boy, and had to buy a plus size wedding dress.\u00a0 We got a dog, bought a house, had some children, and all the while, I kept getting bigger.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://sustainableutopia.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/fat1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright\" title=\"SONY DSC\" src=\"https://sustainableutopia.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/fat1.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a>The bigger I got, the more I started to remove myself from my life. There are very few pictures of me because I hate the way I look. When I do pose for pictures, I try to hide myself away.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Without my noticing, the food began to control my life again. Not in the same way, but with the same force. It&#8217;s all I think about. Food, trying not to eat it, feeling extreme guilt when I do. Hating myself for getting so big. Hating myself.</p>\n<p>And then something incredible happened. I decided to cut myself a break. Yes, I still want to be slimmer, but I&#8217;m starting to realize that it won&#8217;t really change who I am. I&#8217;ve discovered that who I am has been greatly influenced by the fact that I don&#8217;t consider myself to be beautiful. I&#8217;ve always tried my best to be kind to everyone, and especially those who don&#8217;t really like themselves. I give acceptance to anyone and everyone, regardless of their appearance or popularity. Hell, I even dated people that I had little to no interest in, simply because everyone deserves a chance, and anyone can end up surprising you.</p>\n<p>I am Compassionate because I know what it is to be Judged. I have spent my entire life judging myself and I would never want that for another person. It&#8217;s been a long road, and I&#8217;m still on it. Sometimes it&#8217;s bumpy, and yes, sometimes I still judge myself for my physical short comings. I&#8217;m working everyday at changing that inner dialogue. But I know that this bumpy road has lead me to a place where I can cultivate True Love, for myself, and for all.</p>\n", "post_id": 1752, "location": false, "date": "04-20-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["body", "protect", "shell", "love", "thread", "womb", "relation", "mother", "tribute", "unique", "bond"], "text": "<p>by <a title=\"Varungenius\" href=\"http://varungenius.wordpress.com/\">Varungenius</a></p>\n<p>Inside a secure shell,<br />\nAway from manly hell,<br />\nShe protected me from teary rain,<br />\nGiving me breaths, taking my pain;<br />\nBreathing same air, hearing same sound,<br />\nConnected by blood lines, together we are bound,<br />\nFeeling what I felt,<br />\nDealing what I dealt,<br />\nShe never blamed my moves,<br />\nHolding me tight, she never let me loose.</p>\n<p>From the dry ground,<br />\nWater, for me, she found,<br />\nDrowning herself in tears,<br />\nShe protected me from fears,<br />\nWith empty chamber in dark night,<br />\nShe fed me with positive light,<br />\nLying on floor she kept me high,<br />\nSinging hymns of joy without any sigh,<br />\nTaking me away from the unknown crowd,<br />\nShe gave me smiles when I cried out loud.<a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/mother-and-child2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright  wp-image-1756\" title=\"mother-and-child2\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/mother-and-child2.jpg?w=348&#038;h=419\" alt=\"\" width=\"348\" height=\"419\" /></a></p>\n<p>On the cradle of love and care,<br />\nShe gave me swings of joyful stare,<br />\nWith surprising faces and wide giggles,<br />\nShe made me laugh with bodily ripples,<br />\nFrom the depths of frequent nightmares,<br />\nShe pulled me out of strange dark layers,<br />\nHolding my hand, making me stand,<br />\nShe moulded my feet for walking on strand,<br />\nKissing at my every wound,<br />\nShe created everything that I ruined.</p>\n<p>To every temple I pray, She is my prayer,<br />\nTo every spark I ignite, She is my flare,<br />\nTo every wish I make, She is my belief,<br />\nTo every pain I bear, She is my relief,<br />\nTo every word I say, She is my meaning,<br />\nTo every mistake I commit, She is my learning,<br />\nTo every photo I capture, She is my frame,<br />\nEverything that was unknown, She gave it a name.</p>\n<p>A figure of LOVE,<br />\nDedicated to serve,<br />\nA sea of care,<br />\nPure at every layer,<br />\nA relation forever strong,<br />\nTrue in hearts, never wrong,<br />\nA trustful thread that remained,<br />\nChained but unchained,<br />\nA connection so divine,<br />\nEven GOD stands in line,<br />\nLinked to one another,<br />\nMe and my sweet MOTHER\u2026!!!</p>\n", "post_id": 1755, "location": false, "date": "04-21-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Outward Compassion", "Alternate Economy", "8 Week Challenge"], "text": "<p>For this essay, in the <a title=\"8 Week Challenge\" href=\"http://alternateeconomy.wordpress.com/2012/04/18/week-2-compassion/\">8 Week Challenge</a>, I will be using Tristan&#8217;s definition of <strong>Outward Compassion</strong>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;&#8230;.. looking at a situation and seeing how you would want to be treated in that scenario and then acting accordingly &#8230;..&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>I think this one works as well as any, as it <strong>i</strong><strong>nvolves\u00a0so many parts of what it means to be\u00a0human: **Seeing that a situation can be altered **Recognizing another&#8217;s plight as our own **Engaging with it enough to find a solution **Taking the action to bring about the change **Doing all this on behalf of someone else</strong></p>\n<p>So, one small example &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..</p>\n<p>M<a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/dsc01902.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-1762\" title=\"Shala's dog Theo\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/dsc01902.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>y dad &amp; I, &amp; Theo, went to a Dog Fest in a local park this weekend &#8212; our Earth Day outing. We gathered some water &amp; a bowl, the leash &amp; a towel for Theo, hats for ourselves, piled into the truck &amp; we were off. We spent a very fun morning, talking with folks about their dogs, finding out about rescue groups &amp; herbal tick repellents, &amp; meeting Radar, a local TV station&#8217;s weather dog. Bonus: all the pooches were relatively well-mannered &#8212; we figured that those with aggressive dogs probably self-selected them out of the event.</p>\n<p>In addition to the other &#8216;accessories&#8217; we brought for Theo, I had come with a couple of plastic bags. When I&#8217;m out with him, I always pick up after he does &#8220;his business&#8221; &#8212; I mean, I really hate stepping in canine crap, so I won&#8217;t impose the indignity upon others. I&#8217;m a little bit obsessive about this, assiduously collecting plastic bags to keep at the ready &#8212; from frozen veggies, newspaper protectors, &amp; any other such impermeable bag. When I&#8217;m out with the dog<a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/dsc02937.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-1763\" title=\"Plastic bags\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/dsc02937.jpg?w=300&#038;h=224\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"224\" /></a>, I always carry 2 or 3 with me. On those few occasions when I&#8217;ve forgotten to carry a bag with me, I&#8217;ve even been known to steal the plastic sleeve off someone&#8217;s newspaper. So, I was &#8220;armed&#8221; at the Dog Fest, &amp; ready to do my doody\u00a0duty. And, naturally, given that there were many dozens of canines present, there were indeed\u00a0some dog bombs. The one I encountered, the size of several small potatoes (Great Dane??) was smack dab in the middle of the main throughway, where many folks were strolling, not paying attention to where they stepped. Someone had already rolled their baby stroller through it so Something Had To Be Done.</p>\n<p>Once I spotted the dreaded doo, I knew I would pick it up. How could I ask someone else to? But I wanted to find a trash can 1st, so I wouldn&#8217;t have to carry it around all over in the crush of people, &amp; I could not see one anywhere! As I stood there, looking around, I had to keep catching people&#8217;s attention so they wouldn&#8217;t step in it &#8212; tugging on their sleeves, moving in front of them, actually pushing some aside. This gave me an inner giggle as I realized: A) among the vendors there were 3 separate businesses devoted to Picking Up After Dogs, &amp;, B) I was actually standing guard <em>over dog shit!!!</em> Anyway, I finally spotted a trash can, efficiently whipped out my yellow plastic newspaper sleeve &amp; took care of the mess.</p>\n<p>This is a small thing, for sure (unless you&#8217;ve ever actually had to clean pooch poop from the treads of your sneakers), but it&#8217;s like everything else: <strong>Once\u00a0WE have realized\u00a0something needs to be done, <em>how can\u00a0we expect someone else to be the one to do it?!</em> </strong>I hope someone witnessed my efforts, not to be\u00a0thanked, but to plant the seed in their consciousness that we can all make the world a little less crap-ful for others, haha</p>\n<h6>Related articles</h6>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.wordpress.com/2012/04/18/week-2-compassion/\" target=\"_blank\">Week 2: Compassion</a> (alternateeconomy.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.wordpress.com/2012/04/19/week-2-inward-compassion-a-work-in-progress/\" target=\"_blank\">Week 2: Inward Compassion, a work in progress</a> (alternateeconomy.wordpress.com)</li>\n</ul>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.wordpress.com/2012/04/18/week-2-compassion/\" target=\"_blank\">Week 2: Compassion</a> (alternateeconomy.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.wordpress.com/2012/04/19/week-2-inward-compassion-a-work-in-progress/\" target=\"_blank\">Week 2: Inward Compassion, a work in progress</a> (alternateeconomy.wordpress.com)</li>\n</ul>\n", "post_id": 1759, "location": false, "date": "04-22-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["american friends", "Lesley", "passion", "thanks", "Living in Love", "hate", "happiness", "astrology", "cancer", "alternateeconomy", "alternate", "Award", "remorse", "humanity", "hope", "belonging", "compassion", "healthy-living", "judgement", "The 8 Week Challenge", "loss", "prize", "truth", "sustainable", "security", "art", "selfishness", "sustainableutopia", "vacation hot spots", "best", "Lesley Pelletier", "Life", "movies", "positivity", "emotions", "situational", "receiving", "writing 2012", "gratitude", "joy", "aquarius", "weight-loss", "balanced emotions", "receive", "universe", "vulnerable", "foolishness", "conversation", "fear", "protection", "hatred", "emotion", "love", "family", "community", "altecon", "alternate economey", "open", "true sharing", "story", "create", "vacation", "greatness", "friend", "sharing", "take part", "8", "true", "join", "challenge", "generosity", "utopia", "freedom", "fun", "balance", "vulnerability", "ae", "give", "age of aquarius", "imagination", "gemini", "education", "film", "selfish", "food glorious food", "daring", "inheritance", "travel", "peace", "comments section", "les1lesley", "economy", "alternative", "best friend", "sustainability", "radio show", "overt", "friends", "8 Week Challenge", "together", "greed"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/badge.jpg\"><img src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/badge.jpg?w=300&#038;h=300\" alt=\"\" title=\"badge\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1497\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alternate-economy.com/radio.php\">The Alternate Economy Radio Station</a></p>\n<p>Please tune in to the first episode of the 8 Week Challenge, hosted by Lesley Pelletier on the Alternate Economy&#8217;s Radio!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alternate-economy.com/radio.php\">Week 1 &#8211; Generosity</a></p>\n<p>Follow the link to find the show hosted on my site.

Happiness never decreases by being shared\u201d ~ The Buddha</em></p>\n<p>Among all the helpful emotions developed on the Buddhist path, love is perhaps one of the most important.</p>\n<p>It helps to ensure that a person\u2019s spiritual life is based on healthy and open relationships with the people around them, and with other forms of life.</p>\n<p>It also creates the right inner conditions for the heart to relax and be at peace.</p>\n<p>It is usually easy to have kind and loving feels towards those people that we love \u2013 our friends and family. Focusing on developing those feelings towards the people you care about is an important basis for developing a loving kindness practice.</p>\n<p>The stronger the foundation of our loving-kindness practice is, the easier it is to expand our loving-kindness practice to those people towards whom we would not normally feel kindness. The ultimate goal in developing a loving-kindness practice is to feel the same level of goodwill, love, friendliness, and acceptance towards everyone \u2013 friends and strangers alike.</p>\n<p>The sense of \u201cself\u201d and \u201cother\u201d will fall away, and be replaced by an extensive feeling of open heartedness.</p>\n<p>Here are some of my favourite tips for strengthening loving-kindness:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Practice loving=kindness meditation.</li>\n<li>Be a good listener. Listen fully and openly without thinking about what you are going to say next, or trying to offer advice or a solution</li>\n<li>Smile at everyone</li>\n<li></li>\n<li>Practice random acts of kindness (RAOK\u2019s)</li>\n<li>Cook a meal for family of friends</li>\n<li>Call or visit someone who is sick</li>\n<li>Tell someone you appreciate them</li>\n<li>Pass on feedback if you receive good customer service \u2013 let the person\u2019s manager know</li>\n<li>Be generous with compliments</li>\n<li>Be positive</li>\n<li>Share inspirational quotes</li>\n<li>Be grateful for what you have</li>\n<li>Treat everyone equally and with respect</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And my favourite:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Act on feelings of warmth and compassion. Don\u2019t be afraid to express feelings of kindness and goodwill.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I am really excited about developing my own loving-kindness practice.</p>\n<p>I have only recently started focusing on it intensively, and practising loving kindness-meditation as well. However I can already feel a huge difference.</p>\n<p>A real sense of an opening and softening of my heart, and a very deep desire to help people, and to ease their suffering.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s such a beautiful feeling \u2665</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em>May you be happy</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em>May you be safe</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em>May you be healthy</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em>May you be peaceful</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/flower21.jpg\"><img src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/flower21.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200\" alt=\"\" title=\"flower21\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1771\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 1770, "location": false, "date": "04-22-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["emotion", "alternate", "love", "cancer", "give", "age of aquarius", "gemini", "thanks", "selfishness", "alternative", "hate", "fear", "film", "astrology", "gratitude", "selfish", "story", "inheritance", "peace", "writing", "passion", "happiness", "remorse", "hope", "economy", "compassion", "joy", "aquarius", "judgement", "protection", "security", "loss", "receive", "freedom", "foolishness", "movies", "universe", "hatred", "balance", "greed", "generosity"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/a-ray-of-hope.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1782\" title=\"A-Ray-of-Hope\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/a-ray-of-hope.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>What is Hope?</strong></p>\n<table width=\"150\" border=\"1\" bgcolor=\"#99ccff\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;\" align=\"center\"><a href=\"http://alternate-economy.com/wordpress/blog/2012/01/01/hope/\">Core Essay on Hope</a></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Hope is a powerful tool for the creation of Love. It is the final outwardly expressed emotion that we will be investigating in this challenge. Like Generosity and Compassion, Hope is created through positive action and can be spread to those around us. It is an outward expression of our emotion because it flows most powerfully when it is imparted to another. When we live in Hope we begin to see that every action we take moves us closer to our final goal. Provided we are able to listen to the lesson which accompanies every action. When we live in Hope, we see that even our failures bring us closer to our ultimate destination. Because our failures allow us to more keenly perfect our next positive action.</p>\n<p>Hope comes from within, when we set concrete goals and move forward with positive action. But it is expressed most effectively when it is allowed to shine forth for all around to see. Hope is infectious and as we move closer to our goals, our overwhelming sense of gratitude helps fuel the fires of Love. As we share our Hope with those around us our own feelings of Hope will grow as well.  So long as we are always moving forwards, we are always living with Hope.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/badge.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1497\" title=\"badge\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/badge.jpg?w=300&#038;h=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>This Weeks Challenge</strong></p>\n<p>The word &#8220;Hope&#8221; is characterized by Merriam-Webster as: &#8220;to cherish a desire with anticipation.&#8221; That definition could certainly use some expansion. Hope comes from setting concrete goals, taking positive action and sharing our gratitude to create hope in others.</p>\n<p>Being Hopeful may seem difficult in this day and age, but it&#8217;s just a matter of making that conscious switch in your mind, until it becomes automatic. When fear stops you in your tracks take a deep breath and remember to have faith in yourself. Sometimes life will be difficult, it just will be. But that&#8217;s okay. Assuming we take our failures in stride and learn the lesson presented to us, we can keep a sense of hope. Even in failure, we can still move closer to our goal, if we are able to see the lesson in our failure, and adapt our next positive action accordingly.</p>\n<p>The following examples are suggestions only. Feel free to incorporate as many of them into your daily life as you are able to, or create your own examples of Hope.</p>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:awards@alternate-economy.com\">Send Entries to awards@alternate-economy.com</a></p>\n<p>The following challenge is split into three categories.

This essay can be anywhere from 500 to 1000 words and will become a post on this blog.</p>\n<table width=\"150\" border=\"1\" bgcolor=\"#99ccff\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;\" align=\"center\"><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.wordpress.com/2012/04/26/8-week-challenge-hope-concrete-goals/\">Concrete Goals</a></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The first step to achieving Hope in our everyday lives is creating concrete goals. Without a set of goals, fostering a sense of hope is practically impossible. Hope arrives when we move towards our goals with Love in our heart. Take some time to write down several goals for your life in Love. Set an easily achievable goal for this week, but also write down a few long term goals that have been on your mind recently. Below are a few examples of easily achievable goals for this week.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Choose a neglected area of the house and add a little Love. Watch how the newly improved space helps lift your spirits.<br />\n\u2022 Make a new friend by approaching a stranger. It&#8217;s tough to make new friends, but it is even tougher when we are afraid to talk to new people. You may not end up with a best friend, but you&#8217;ll both be richer for the conversation.<br />\n\u2022 Start Meditating, even for just a few minutes a day. Imagine all of the things you have to accomplish that day, and visualize yourself accomplishing them.<br />\n\u2022 Try to be patient. With yourself, with everyone else. Don&#8217;t give over to frustration, just let go and let everything work itself out.<br />\n\u2022 Do something that scares you. Face a fear. Probe a phobia. Nothing gives more hope than overcoming something you&#8217;ve always been afraid of.</p>\n<table width=\"150\" border=\"1\" bgcolor=\"#99ccff\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;\" align=\"center\"><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.wordpress.com/2012/05/03/positive-action/\">Positive Action</a></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>This part of the challenge is where we begin to take the first step towards completing the items on our list of concrete goals.  Hope is created through positive actions.  It is reinforced when we move towards our goals.  Take some time to really plan out how you will take your step towards your goal, with Love as your motivator.  Then do it!</p>\n<table width=\"150\" border=\"1\" bgcolor=\"#99ccff\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;\" align=\"center\"><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.wordpress.com/2012/05/18/shared-hope/\">Infectious Hope</a></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Infectious Hope is the act of spreading your Loving feelings to others.  It comes from gratitude and arrives when we take a step closer to our goals and then include those around us in our success.  If anyone has helped us to reach our goals we will surely be thankful for their involvement.  Even those who did not help us will be able to see our overwhelming sense of Hope.  By using positive encouragement, we can pass our Hope on to anyone.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Be positive. Curtail pessimism and remember that there is always Hope.<br />\n\u2022 Curtail the pessimism of others. Point out silver linings whenever you can.<br />\n\u2022 Give someone else some Hope. If you know someone who has been struggling with a project for a while, help them complete it.<br />\n\u2022 Listen for opportunities to include people in your goals.  We soon see that any job becomes easier with the help of others.<br />\n\u2022 Don&#8217;t rain on parades. It&#8217;s so easy to fall back into cynical habits and squash the ideas of others. Instead, congratulate them on their creativity and help them succeed.</p>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:awards@alternate-economy.com\">Send Entries to awards@alternate-economy.com</a></p>\n", "post_id": 1781, "location": false, "date": "04-23-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["emotion", "alternate", "love", "cancer", "give", "age of aquarius", "gemini", "thanks", "selfishness", "alternative", "hate", "fear", "film", "astrology", "gratitude", "selfish", "story", "inheritance", "peace", "writing", "passion", "happiness", "remorse", "hope", "economy", "compassion", "joy", "aquarius", "judgement", "protection", "security", "loss", "receive", "freedom", "foolishness", "movies", "universe", "hatred", "balance", "greed", "generosity"], "text": "<p>As my example of outward compassion I will again be posting a copy of a document I wrote a while ago.

It has a population of homeless people that struggle to survive from day to day.  I see many such people on the streets of downtown Ottawa, asking for change.  I often think to myself, &#8220;Give me time and I will bring you change.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A few weeks ago, as I was in line at a local sandwich shop it occurred to me that perhaps I should buy two sandwiches instead of one.   I had some time and felt like making a little change.  I walked around for a bit looking for someone who seemed like they might be hungry.  On this particular day it was rather cold, and there were few people around.  It is funny how when we are looking for something, it is always harder to find it.  I was just getting ready to give up when I rounded a corner a second time and found a man in his early fifties with his hat outstretched and a rather nasty scab on his nose. I offered him a sandwich and asked him if I could sit down. </p>\n<p>He seemed rather surprised at this gesture.  I had two sandwiches, one ham and one roast beef.  I asked him which one he would prefer and he literally stuttered over the answer.  What I gathered was that he would be happy with either one, but I insisted he choose.  He settled on the roast beef and unwrapped it, to take a big bite.</p>\n<p>We ate together, quietly at first. After a couple of bites he put his sandwich aside and he began to talk. I said very little, mostly listened. I know that when I am down, I usually only really want someone to listen to me. So listen I did. </p>\n<p>It turns out his best friend is a bottle. He introduced me to him very quickly and explained how his life now had a lot to do with his daily 8:00 am stroll across the bridge to Gatineau where he has credit at a small depaneur. He would buy himself a couple of tall cans of beer, usually on credit, but then would always pay his debts every Wednesday, when he received his allowance from his mother.  It seems his mother was alive and guarding some small fortune that had been left to him.  Because he can&#8217;t be trusted (his words), his mother gives him $100 a week as an allowance. </p>\n<p>The proof he couldn&#8217;t be trusted was the inch long scab that was healing on his nose.  The result of a drunken brawl from just a couple of days ago.  It seems that at the shelter he stays at he has a few enemies.  Men that harass him for his allowance and even beat him up.  As I tried to think of anything to say, I realized that nothing was expected and instead listened with Love in my heart.</p>\n<p>After I finished my sandwich I excused myself and wished him a good day.  I told him he was a good friend and that I looked forward to seeing him again.  He thanked me for the sandwich and I walked home.  </p>\n<p>Outward compassion is about identifying what someone is really asking for and giving it to them.  When a homeless person asks you for change, don&#8217;t search in your pocket for coins.  Offer them TRUE change.</p>\n", "post_id": 1796, "location": false, "date": "04-23-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["emotion", "joy", "peace", "art", "american friends", "family", "give", "best", "Outward Compassion", "Lesley", "community", "imagination", "passion", "altecon", "alternate economey", "love", "Living in Love", "ae", "open", "sustainableutopia", "happiness", "true sharing", "selfish", "Life", "education", "vulnerability", "daring", "alternateeconomy", "conversation", "friends", "create", "alternate", "balanced emotions", "vacation", "Award", "vacation hot spots", "situational", "les1lesley", "greatness", "best friend", "8", "gratitude", "receiving", "humanity", "friend", "2012", "Lesley Pelletier", "belonging", "sharing", "compassion", "healthy-living", "fun", "radio show", "overt", "true", "take part", "8 Week Challenge", "The 8 Week Challenge", "join", "prize", "sustainability", "receive", "freedom", "challenge", "vulnerable", "together", "emotions", "generosity", "utopia", "comments section", "hope", "truth", "sustainable", "security", "balance", "travel", "positivity", "greed", "thanks"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://sustainableutopia.wordpress.com/\"><img class=\"alignleft\" title=\"a\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/badge.jpg?w=300&amp;h=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"108\" height=\"108\" /></a>When I set out on this part of the 8 Week Challenge, I actually\u00a0 wasn&#8217;t concerned about having nothing to write about at all. Outward Compassion is my thing. I&#8217;m still working on having Compassion for myself, but that&#8217;s another post <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-wink' title=';)'>;)</span>. I don&#8217;t find Outward Compassion to be all that difficult. I make a conscious effort to not judge people, I put myself in the shoes of others, I picture things from other perspectives all the time. It&#8217;s the only way I can accept some of the horrible things that others do. I have to always remind myself that yes, what they <em>did</em> was horrible, but every person has a story and a path that lead them to where they are in their lives, and I can&#8217;t judge them for that. My intention in writing about Outward Compassion, was to take part in a debate while representing a side that I didn&#8217;t personally agree with. It soon became something entirely different.</p>\n<p>Until recently, one of my hobbies was engaging in online debates. No, not as one of those trolls who starts arguments in comments on news articles. I actually sought out and joined an online debate forum. I used to go on there everyday and engage in some pretty lively debates. You&#8217;ll notice that I said &#8220;until recently&#8221;. I&#8217;ve actually noticed that the further my Journey to Love takes me, the less interest I have in engaging in these lively debates with others. Not because I don&#8217;t still like to debate, but because some of the debate tactics of others are some of the most unkind, unloving and disrespectful methods of communication I have ever encountered. Most people today seem to be rather rooted in either very Liberal or very Conservative soil, and their debate tactics reflect that. I, on the other hand, am firmly in the middle. I have some conservative views and I have some liberal views. Both of which will influence my debate arguments. This has gotten me into trouble on these debate forums. You see, most people will expect you to take a position that is either liberal or conservative, and prepare their mud slings to attack your political leanings, not your prepared arguments. I have found this to be the case in nearly every single debate I have been in. The topic will quickly go from taking sides about a particular current event, and devolve into criticizing someone for simply being a bleeding heart liberal or a die hard conservative.</p>\n<p>So, as I said, I logged on to my debate forums this week with the intention of taking an opposite position than what I personally agree with. The topic is unimportant, because, like so many other debates, this one turned into a mudslinging contest within just the first ten posts. It didn&#8217;t take long for someone to notice my tendency to shine light on grey areas and jump on me for it. One person in particular started to make things very personal. She attacked my debate tactics, called me naive, and even pointed out that debating with me used to be much more fun for her before I got all &#8220;Lovey-dovey&#8221;. What started out as me taking part in a debate to try and see from the perspective of another, ended up with me doing just that. But instead of it being as part of the debate, I was now seeing things from the perspective of the other debater. Whereas once I would have become incredibly defensive, and perhaps started to sling some mud of my own, I tried to see where this woman was coming from. I may never know her personal story, but I know that she has one. I know that her cynical nature is a result of the life she has lived, and that I can&#8217;t worry about defending myself from her inaccurate assumptions of me, but instead have compassion for her and her situation. I, of course, did not say these things to her. She would have found that patronizing, I&#8217;m sure, which would not have helped matters at all. Instead, I thanked her for the learning opportunity, and bowed out gracefully from the debate. I haven&#8217;t been back since.</p>\n<p>What are on those forums, and in fact, even what we see on a larger political scale, are no longer debates. They&#8217;re pissing contests. Who can be the loudest, the meanest and the best at tearing down the other side. I have learned that I can no longer engage in those kinds of debates. All that being said, I still Love me a good debate, so if any of my readers out there who are living a Life in Love know of any good debate forums that don&#8217;t devolve into SHTF scenarios, I&#8217;d love to hear about them. <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)</span></p>\n", "post_id": 1804, "location": false, "date": "04-23-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["compassion", "Mantra", "Om mani padme hum", "Buddha", "8 Week Challenge"], "text": "<p>Just like Lesley of <a href=\"http://sustainableutopia.wordpress.com\">Sustainable Utopia</a>, I also did not keep a journal of my negative mental chatter, as part of Compassion week of the <a title=\"8 Week Challenge\" href=\"http://wp.me/p21f5h-o8\">8 Week Challenge</a>. I&#8217;m very aware of it though, as I&#8217;ve <a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/imagescahpg6wh.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-1810\" title=\"Lotus   www.fcit.usf.edu\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/imagescahpg6wh.jpg?w=259&#038;h=194\" alt=\"\" width=\"259\" height=\"194\" /></a>been working with this issue for a long time. I&#8217;ve learned some things about the self-defeating thoughts that go through my head, unbidden. Here are a few gems I&#8217;ve acquired along the way &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.. It&#8217;s my hope that they will be of some use to you:) ****PLEASE NOTE: I frequently catch myself saying &amp; listening to unsolicited &amp; hateful thoughts; it is a long-standing habit. <em>I am worthy of love &amp; well-being anyway:)****</em></p>\n<p><strong>Negative thoughts</strong> are like unwelcome guests &#8212; you have to acknowledge that they are there; that&#8217;s the reality of it, &amp; no good comes from acting like <em>they are not what they are</em>. But, as with an unwelcome guest, we can <strong>firmly &amp; graciously refuse to entertain them</strong>\u00a0&#8212; kick their asses out! It is an act of quiet upliftment &amp; tacit forgiveness to disallow self-hate.</p>\n<p>I have found over the years that <strong>it&#8217;s not always easy</strong>, or even possible, <strong>to stop the mental berating</strong> I put myself through. But <strong>it IS always possible to replace it with something kinder</strong>. Affirmations are very beneficial for this. I like to compose one or more affirmations aimed at undoing whatever crap I am telling myself. The key is counteracting &amp; counterbalancing. For example: <em>How could you let yourself gain so much weight?!? &#8212;-&gt;&gt;&gt; I am a woman of fierce &amp; vibrant beauty, who needs no one else&#8217;s approval! </em>The worst that will happen is that we will forget the undermining script, for awhile. The best that might happen is &#8230;&#8230;&#8230; we may come to believe it!! The important thing here: Halting the unkind thought stream.</p>\n<p>A few years ago, I discovered <a title=\"Japa mantra\" href=\"http://www.sanatansociety.org/yoga_and_meditation/mantras_japa.htm\">japa mantra</a>, &amp; then received a Guru mantra from Amma. The word &#8216;mantra&#8217; itself means to &#8216;go away from the mind'; it is a powerful means of controlling the contents of <a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/imagescathegkg.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-1811\" title=\"Lotus   www.realmsofrealities.com\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/imagescathegkg.jpg?w=247&#038;h=204\" alt=\"\" width=\"247\" height=\"204\" /></a>our minds. I run various mantras through my head <em>a lot</em>. I mean, thousands of times a day now, walking &#8230;&#8230;&#8230; washing dishes &#8230;&#8230;&#8230; before sleeping &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. in the shower &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.. And lo, I increasingly find that the Guru mantra is <em>coursing through my mind without being consciously started</em> &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.\u00a0 So, if I step off the curb in the path of a runaway bus, a mantra, for example, <em><a title=\"Om mani padme hum\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Om_mani_padme_hum\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">Om mani\u00a0padme hum</a>,</em> might be the last thought stream of my dying mind. As opposed to, say, <em>What kind of a\u00a0friggin&#8217; loser is broke in her mid-50s?!? </em>Oh, so much more auspicious!! <strong>Our crummy self talk lowers our vibrational pattern; mantra actually raises it</strong>, making of us our own Higher Self.</p>\n<p>Which raises the question: If I&#8217;m saying thousands, tens of thousands of mantras each day, <em>how many ugly thoughts might I otherwise be having?!?</em> Good Goddess Almighty, is THAT a frightening realization, or what!? <strong>If we</strong> &#8212; the collective We &#8211;<strong> have been telling ourselves frightful, undermining, self-hating things</strong> bazillions of times a day &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; <strong>ALL of our lives</strong>\u00a0&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.. no wonder the world has such horrors in it, no wonder so many seek desensitizing activities &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; <strong>no wonder so many are suffering</strong>, living as if in hell on earth. Sobering, eh?</p>\n<p>By allowing the foetid junk that free floats through our wee minds to remain, then we are colluding in creating that hell. And that is an ugly, reprehensible behavior, which we can choose to discontinue. The <a title=\"Gautama Buddha\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautama_Buddha\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">Buddha</a> put it this way, simply:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;With our minds we create the world.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>So, there&#8217;s really no other way to see it: By stopping our destructive mental habits, replacing them with more uplifting, kind thought streams, we collectively can begin to create a wholly different kind of world. This can be a world of affirming <a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/imagescafnv8yr.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-1812\" title=\"Lotus   www.flickr.com\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/imagescafnv8yr.jpg?w=275&#038;h=183\" alt=\"\" width=\"275\" height=\"183\" /></a>ourselves &amp; one another, if we want it to be. It can be a world where Joy &amp;\u00a0Compassion &amp; Peace are what we birth, from the seeds of our thoughts, instead of those that begin &amp; perpetuate Destruction, Greed &amp; Hate. Here <strong>we can take the Lotus</strong>, so beloved an image in Asia, <strong>as the symbolic guide for our journey</strong>: <em>It is rooted in the yucky, mucky pond bottom, &amp; rises through the murky water, where it blooms vividly &amp; open to the light on the surface.</em>\u00a0And so it is with us &#8212; we too begin mentally mired in the mucky, yuckiness of self-destructive chatter. As we realize our desire for A Better Way Of Being, our vision is at first clouded, as it is difficult to see clearly, through the murky, clamorous environment of contemporary life. But, as we reach toward that Better Way, <em>as <strong>we become that Better Way</strong>,</em> we too will move into the light, where our blooming, vivid &amp; open, will be of benefit to others &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. It all begins with one thought &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. then, another &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. then &#8230;&#8230;.</p>\n<h6>Related articles</h6>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.wordpress.com/2012/04/18/week-2-compassion/\" target=\"_blank\">Week 2: Compassion</a> (alternateeconomy.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://theworldswisdom.com/2012/04/23/for-the-liberation-of-all-beings/\" target=\"_blank\">For the liberation of all beings</a> (theworldswisdom.com)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://mysticword.wordpress.com/2012/01/27/om-mani-padme-hum/\" target=\"_blank\">Om mani\u00a0padme hum.</a> (mysticword.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.wordpress.com/2012/04/22/week-2-outward-compassion-doing-my-doody-duty/\" target=\"_blank\">Week 2: Outward Compassion, Doing my doody duty</a> (alternateeconomy.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.wordpress.com/2012/04/23/8-week-challenge-outward-compassion/\" target=\"_blank\">8 Week Challenge: Outward Compassion</a> (alternateeconomy.wordpress.com)</li>\n</ul>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://jobblog2011.wordpress.com/2012/04/12/tibet-om-mani-padme-hum/\" target=\"_blank\">Tibet: Om Mani Padme Hum</a> (jobblog2011.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.wordpress.com/2012/04/18/week-2-compassion/\" target=\"_blank\">Week 2: Compassion</a> (alternateeconomy.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://greenteakarma.wordpress.com/2012/02/24/om-mani-padme-hum/\" target=\"_blank\">Om Mani Padme Hum</a> (greenteakarma.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.wordpress.com/2012/04/22/week-2-outward-compassion-doing-my-doody-duty/\" target=\"_blank\">Week 2: Outward Compassion, Doing my doody duty</a> (alternateeconomy.wordpress.com)</li>\n</ul>\n", "post_id": 1808, "location": false, "date": "04-24-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["emotion", "alternate", "love", "cancer", "give", "age of aquarius", "gemini", "thanks", "selfishness", "alternative", "hate", "fear", "film", "astrology", "gratitude", "selfish", "story", "inheritance", "peace", "writing", "passion", "happiness", "remorse", "hope", "economy", "compassion", "joy", "aquarius", "judgement", "protection", "security", "loss", "receive", "freedom", "foolishness", "movies", "universe", "hatred", "balance", "greed", "generosity"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/pour-concrete.jpg\"><img src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/pour-concrete.jpg?w=300&#038;h=199\" alt=\"\" title=\"pour-concrete\" width=\"300\" height=\"199\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1820\" /></a></p>\n<p>As part of this week\u2019s Hope Challenge, I have decided to participate and post some examples of my own that I will be Hoping to accomplish this week.  Without concrete goals, maintaining a feeling of Hope is rather difficult.  Hope requires a destination.  It arises when we move towards that destination with positive action, but it first requires we know where we are headed.  I will be posting three goals for this week as well as one long term goal and I will follow up with my POSITIVE ACTION post to let you know how I fared.</p>\n<p><strong>1: Short Term &#8211; Organize My Closet</strong></p>\n<p>This may not seem like a very inspiring action, unless you consider that I do not have a closet, but rather a floor and a laundry room.  And way too many clothes.  Clothes I never wear.  Clothes that clutter my space.  Clothes that I cannot tell if they are dirty or clean it has been so long that they are in the laundry room&#8230;  I am a bit of a pig sometimes&#8230;</p>\n<p>This week I am going to take some garbage bags to my bedroom and laundry room and sort out the clothes I need from the clothes I do not.  I will wash all the ones I need and organize them on a bookshelf that is sitting empty in my room.  I will donate the bags of clothing to the Salvation Army.  And I will feel much better for doing it.</p>\n<p><strong>2: Short Term &#8211; Foster a Sense of Receiving</strong></p>\n<p>This one may seem a little vague, but I have been single for 8 months and I still miss my ex every day.  I sometimes get caught up in the feeling that I will never meet anyone else.  I think to myself that my last girlfriend was perfect for me, or so I remember, and she got bored with me.  So how could I ever find anyone that will feel the same way for me as I do for them? </p>\n<p>This week I will move forward with the knowledge that my last girlfriend was not perfect for me.  She was just a person, like any other.  I am Love, so anyone I meet will be perfect for me, provided they are willing to give me a chance.</p>\n<p>This week I will keep my eye open for those chances.  And I will remember that I am here to receive Love, because I am Love.</p>\n<p><strong>3: Short Term &#8211; Eat more Vegetables</strong></p>\n<p>It is funny, as I look through my bags of seeds and prepare the ground at the farm I realize that 90% of these vegetables never grace my refrigerator and if they do, they rarely make it to my stomach.  I am growing this garden for the Alternate Economy because I like to garden and to be outside and to give to my peers.  I don&#8217;t really care that much for vegetables&#8230;</p>\n<p>That isn&#8217;t really true, there is just a certain amount of effort that goes along with cooking a meal involving fresh veggies.  Not much effort, just a little bit more.  And it is that little bit of effort I rarely decide to make.  </p>\n<p>So this week I am going to make an effort.  I am not only going to buy some new and interesting vegges that I never cook with, but I am also going to cook them!  Sometimes I am guilty of forgetting about things until it is too late.  This week I will make an effort to expand my diet.  For both my health and my peace of mind.</p>\n<p><strong>4: Long Term &#8211; Reach 250,000 People Ready to Live in Love</strong></p>\n<p>This one you guys are probably familiar with, but I keep reminding you because I need your help.  I WILL reach 250,000 people, and sooner than you might guess.  This blog is sitting at 2,079 followers as of today.  But I need your help.  I have been overwhelmed with the number of reposts and references this 8 week challenge has received.  I would Love to see that continue.</p>\n<p>For this goal I will not be changing much.  I have been working towards this goal since October of 2011.  And I don&#8217;t plan on stopping.  Even if it kills me, which it probably will.  But everyday I log on to this blog and I am filled with Hope for the future.  I go to sleep and when I wake up 5 new people have found my blog.  There are always new comments every time I return to my computer.  Thank you all so much for being so involved in this project!  Please know that even if I do not respond, I read every single comment and Love you all for your contributions!</p>\n<p>Thank you for helping me get to where I am today.  I can&#8217;t wait to show you what I am capable of!</p>\n", "post_id": 1819, "location": false, "date": "04-24-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["emotion", "joy", "peace", "art", "american friends", "family", "give", "best", "Lesley", "community", "imagination", "passion", "altecon", "alternate economey", "love", "Living in Love", "ae", "open", "sustainableutopia", "happiness", "true sharing", "selfish", "Life", "education", "vulnerability", "daring", "alternateeconomy", "conversation", "friends", "create", "alternate", "balanced emotions", "vacation", "Award", "vacation hot spots", "situational", "les1lesley", "greatness", "best friend", "8", "gratitude", "receiving", "humanity", "friend", "2012", "Lesley Pelletier", "belonging", "sharing", "compassion", "take part", "fun", "radio show", "overt", "true", "8 Week Challenge", "The 8 Week Challenge", "join", "prize", "sustainability", "receive", "freedom", "challenge", "vulnerable", "together", "emotions", "generosity", "utopia", "comments section", "hope", "truth", "sustainable", "loving advice", "security", "balance", "travel", "positivity", "greed", "thanks"], "text": "<p>The theme of this week\u2019s challenge is, as the title suggests, Hope. When I first floated the idea of starting a Challenge to Tristan of the Alternate Economy, I knew that a couple of the weeks were going to be a bit difficult for me, but none more so than Hope. Do I believe in Hope? Of course, and I\u2019ll never stop working towards a future where the world will recognize it. Do I live my life in a way that is conducive to spreading Hope to others? Without a doubt. I\u2019m the queen of silver linings. I can turn a frown upside down in a heart beat and stop pessimism dead in its tracks. The problem is, that\u2019s all for other people. The truth is, I\u2019m not a very Hopeful person.</p>\n<p>What? You don\u2019t believe me? I know, I put up a very good front, and trust me, I feel like the biggest hypocrite in the world sometimes. Who am I to be constantly cheering people up, when inside I\u2019m just as down in the dumps as they are? I feel like sometimes I\u2019m only being optimistic so that there\u2019s at least one person in the room who can point out the bright side of something, even if I personally don\u2019t see it myself. I figure that somebody\u2019s got to be positive, and if no one else will do it, it\u2019ll be my job. The problem with that, though, is that being Hopeful shouldn\u2019t be a job, because then it\u2019s an obligation. I find myself growing resentful of always having to be the happy person. I feel guilty when I\u2019m not in the best of moods, and then I try to force good humour. I get so tied up in showing people the silver lining, that I don\u2019t even notice\u00a0 when my \u201cLoving\u201d advice turns out to be a great big dark cloud that ruins someone\u2019s otherwise perfect day.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not like I\u2019m completely without Hope though. I am very Hopeful for others. I like to help others achieve goals, I want to see the world succeed, I want to abolish fear in the minds of the masses. I just have such a hard time when it comes to me. It\u2019s one thing to smile at someone and tell them it\u2019s all going to be all right, it\u2019s another thing to believe that for yourself. Sometimes I feel that my life has strayed so far from where I thought I would be that I just sit with my head in my hands and I can\u2019t even weep I\u2019m so Hopeless. And then, of course, I feel guilty for thinking that way, because I have so much that I\u2019m grateful for. But even though I\u2019m so happy and fulfilled with what I have, there are still some things that I want that I know I\u2019ll never have. What\u2019s the point in holding out Hope for something that is impossible? What lesson is there in Hoping for something that will never be? Sometimes Hope just seems so\u2026. useless. There\u2019s an expression (if you\u2019ll excuse my crudeness) that goes \u201cHope in one hand and shit in the other, see which one fills up faster\u201d, and most days, that\u2019s exactly how I feel about Hope. It doesn\u2019t get you anything except disappointment. This is why I feel like such a hypocrite for spending my days trying to inspire Hope in others, because I just don\u2019t have any left for myself. I even considered not participating in the challenge this week, and just hoping (ironically, of course) that no one would notice. But, because the challenges are about inspiring others, and I can\u2019t possibly be the only person in the world who feels this way, I\u2019m participating anyway, albeit in a slightly altered way.</p>\n<p>My goal, short term and long term, is to try and find Hope. Not to spread it around, because if I can find it for myself, spreading it to others will happen on its own. I need to believe in Hope again. I need to find the proof that having Hope is not a fruitless endeavor. I need to see Hopes coming true and paying off. I need to stop Hoping for things that are impossible, and Hope for things that are achievable. I need to be able to be Hopeful for something, strive for it, and actually accomplish it. I need Hope.</p>\n<p>So, not the most inspiring, uplifting or Hopeful post this week, but it was Honest. Please, feel free to share your stories of Hope with me. I could use the inspiration.</p>\n", "post_id": 1831, "location": false, "date": "04-25-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Pamplona", "Bipolar Dance", "compassion", "Alternate Economy", "Mantra", "MindMindful", "Mindfulness", "8 Week Challenge"], "text": "<p>I got a very interesting, evocative response to my post, &#8220;Week 2: Compassion, Forgiveness Dialogue &#8212; We be Lotus&#8221;\u00a0\u00a0 <a href=\"http://wp.me/p21f5h-ta\">http://wp.me/p21f5h-ta</a> (on Alternate Economy), <a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/images.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-1837\" title=\"Lotus   www.lotusonthenile.com\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/images.jpg?w=256&#038;h=197\" alt=\"\" width=\"256\" height=\"197\" /></a><a href=\"http://wp.me/p1zocx-1lD\">http://wp.me/p1zocx-1lD</a> (on <a href=\"http://mindmindful.wordpress.com\">MindMindful</a>). I was writing about the use of affirmations &amp; <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Mantra\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantra\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">mantras</a> to quell negative thoughts we so often have about ourselves. Anita S, who blogs at <a title=\"Bipolar Dance\" href=\"www.anitasimpson.com\">Bipolar Dance &#8230;&#8230; coming to you from the edge of surreality</a>, said she also has used affirmations &#8220;to counteract my self-hateful thoughts&#8221;, but has not used mantras before. Then, she goes on to speculate:</p>\n<blockquote><p>the mantras have a potential to have a much greater effect because an affirmation often brings about argument in my head; for example \u201cI\u2019m fat and ugly\u2026 I have a strong and healthy body\u2026 no I\u2019m terribly out of shape\u2026 My body fulfills my needs\u2026 yeah but it\u2019s a really sucky body, people must cringe when they see me\u2026\u201d and so on. <em>A mantra, however, is not a head-on contradiction of a negative thought, so it may not stir up that critical, argumentative part of me. </em>(Italics mine)</p></blockquote>\n<p>I think this is a very perceptive insight, &amp; may be the reason I moved to using mantras far more than affirmations, myself. Chanting mantras completely bypasses that part of my/our minds that wants to fight over being &#8220;right&#8221;. This part of MY mind, that earnest, adversarial ego, is often <em>very</em> willingly engaged &#8212; it,<em> that is: I</em>, sometimes just wants to hang on to an idea, &amp; fight over who is right &amp; who is wrong, til finally the &#8216;other side&#8217; is willing to give up, exhausted. Alas, this tendency &#8212; while perhaps useful in a lawyer &#8212; has caused me SO much trouble over the years!! The way scorched earth warfare causes trouble. And I&#8217;ve worked hard, for a long time, to temper this habit, &amp; to let it out only when it&#8217;s really useful. The process has been much like stopping the bulls running at <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Pamplona\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pamplona\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">Pamplona</a>: not very easy, &amp; not very suc<a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/imagescamsa3xe.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-1838\" title=\"Lotus   www.figureworks.com\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/imagescamsa3xe.jpg?w=201&#038;h=251\" alt=\"\" width=\"201\" height=\"251\" /></a>cessful. This tendency in myself began to be far less knee-jerk, &amp; much less easily set off, when I began diligently working with mantras.</p>\n<p>I wanted to get rid of, to completely eradicate, this argumentative aspect of my mind. I always saw it as &#8220;not good&#8221;, &amp; hated it. But, as I write this (which so often happens!!), I am realizing that there is another way to see this combative side of my mind: It has been, &amp; is still, a powerful motivator toward quieting my mind, learning to pause before responding &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. &amp;, perhaps most importantly, letting many things just go by, without engaging adversarily. It has been a major factor in my journey toward a more mindful way of being.\u00a0 So &#8212; turning my &#8220;battle&#8221; with this aspect of mind around, I am now seeing it THIS way: I can forgive myself for its excesses, while resolving to keep it pacified. <strong>I can now be grateful for it, because it has led me to the ability to create more peace in the world.</strong></p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.wordpress.com/2012/04/24/week-2-compassion-forgiveness-dialogue-we-be-lotus/\" target=\"_blank\">Week 2: Compassion, Forgiveness Dialogue &#8211; We be Lotus</a> (alternateeconomy.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://moulsinc.com/2012/04/12/how-mantra-meditation-improves-quality-of-life/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">How Mantra Meditation Improves Quality of Life?</a> (moulsinc.com)</li>\n</ul>\n", "post_id": 1836, "location": false, "date": "04-25-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["emotion", "alternate", "love", "cancer", "give", "age of aquarius", "gemini", "thanks", "selfishness", "alternative", "hate", "fear", "film", "astrology", "gratitude", "selfish", "story", "inheritance", "peace", "writing", "passion", "happiness", "remorse", "hope", "economy", "compassion", "joy", "aquarius", "judgement", "protection", "security", "loss", "receive", "freedom", "foolishness", "movies", "universe", "hatred", "balance", "greed", "generosity"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/hope1.jpg\"><img src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/hope1.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" alt=\"\" title=\"hope1\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1843\" /></a></p>\n<p>In a world wracked with fear, in a life full of suffering, in a time that knows only war, how can we possibly find hope?  Where does it exist?  With so many failures and so few supporters, how can we keep that tiny flicker of hope aflame?  As I see the responses to this week&#8217;s challenge emerge I have come to realize that maybe we need a little more Hope this week, to get us started.</p>\n<p>Fear.  Everywhere fear.  Fear of death.  Fear of losing our property.  Fear of unemployment.  Fear of our secrets emerging.  Fear of rejection.  My personal favourite.  The fear that we are somehow different than everyone else.  That we just don&#8217;t fit in.  That we are alone in a world of madness and chaos.  The fear that nobody wants us around.  That nobody understands.  That nobody cares.</p>\n<p>Who does not suffer this fear?  The fear of walking up to a stranger and saying to them, &#8220;I get a really good energy off of you, would you like to grab a coffee?  My treat?&#8221;  Why is that so terrifying?  All we really want is to have more Love in our life.  So why can&#8217;t we ever seem to muster the courage to go out and find it?</p>\n<p>Today I went out for lunch at Moxie&#8217;s, a chain restaurant in the area.  I was with my grandfather and we had a nice chat and took some time to catch up.  While there I couldn&#8217;t help but notice that our waitress was very attractive.  I also couldn&#8217;t help but notice that she was only really talking to me and she was making very good eye contact with lots of smiles.  Granted I was with a man 50 years older than her, but she definitely was showing me a lot more attention.</p>\n<p>&#8220;So, how long have you worked here?&#8221;</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s it.  That&#8217;s all I had to say.  I wanted to.  She would have answered me.  She would have chatted with me.  She might even have agreed to coffee later.  But I was with my grandfather.  Hardly the time to talk to a stranger&#8230;</p>\n<p>Why?  Why not talk to her?  Because of my grandfather?  Sure, nice try.  Because of fear.  Fear that my grandfather would be embarrassed, which is silly.  Fear that she would be uninterested, which is sillier.  And fear that she might actually say yes&#8230;  you heard me.  Fear that I would have to introduce her to someone I do not always trust.  Tristan.</p>\n<p>I am so tired of fear.  It hurts my soul.  It brings me down.  It makes my food taste bitter and my mood even worse.  I would rather live in Hope.  I would rather live in Love.</p>\n<p>But how?  What to do?</p>\n<p>This week, as part of my Challenge to Live in Hope, I will be taking my show on the road.  I am going to go back to Moxie&#8217;s with a pen and a pad of paper.  I am going to ask for a table for one and order some lunch and write a post for my blog.  And I am going to initiate a conversation with my waitress and find out her name.</p>\n<p>Wish me luck!</p>\n", "post_id": 1842, "location": false, "date": "04-25-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Bodhisattva", "Low carb diet", "Vermicompost", "Mindful eating", "hope", "8 Week Challenge"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/imagesca5o4sud.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-1853\" title=\"Hope   www.flickriver.com\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/imagesca5o4sud.jpg?w=259&#038;h=194\" alt=\"\" width=\"259\" height=\"194\" /></a>Lesley of <a href=\"http://sustainableutopia.wordpress.com\">Sustainable Utopia</a> so perfectly expressed <a title=\"Lesley Pelletier's post, 'Hope'\" href=\"http://wp.me/p21f5h-tx\">the way I feel about &#8220;Hope&#8221;, </a>as well as my personal experience of it, that I won&#8217;t bother writing about it, ha!

The earliest strategy has morphed a bit to counting carbs. A <a title=\"Low-carbohydrate diet\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-carbohydrate_diet\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">low carb diet</a>\u00a0has always been the best for me, in terms of how I feel &amp; how I end up looking. Because of the circumstances of my life right now, this is a bit difficult to pursue in the way I&#8217;d prefer, but still do-able. The ultimate strategy for Remodeling the Temple is to recreate my whole relationship with food &amp; eating, moving toward mindful eating instead of turning to food to fulfill other, more basic hungers. This is a long term, lifestyle issue really, so I&#8217;ll just stick to the immediate goal of weight loss for this post. But I cannot say that it&#8217;s going all that well at this time, though I do feel quite a bit better.</p>\n<p>**I want to create a business, raising compost worms &amp; harvesting the <a title=\"Vermicompost\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermicompost\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">vermicompost</a>.

A worm wrangler I am, yearning to be\u00a0unleashed!! But, I have no land. I have not got the monetary resources to even buy a pound of compost worms, &amp; no place to set up on even a very modest scale. I&#8217;m not able to borrow money, from either institutions or the fam. And &#8212; here&#8217;s where despair really lies in wait &#8212; I see no prospects for gainful employment in my near future. In short &#8212; in this area of my life, I really &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.. i\u00a0really feel hope less &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; Still, I know that there&#8217;s a place for this, at some point in my future. I keep up with blogs &amp; web sites on vermicomposting (<a href=\"www.redwormcomposting.com\">here&#8217;s one of my faves</a>), I price equipment, I plan for the start up\u00a0business &amp; its subsequent expansion, I&#8217;m determined to avoid whining. I&#8217;m not giving up; I just don&#8217;t see how the-way-it-is-right-now is going to become what-I-want-it-to-be any time soon. SIDE NOTE: The plans, &amp; hopes, for such a business are still in process, though mostly unseen. Which is largly the way in which compost worms themselves go about <em>their</em> business, haha</p>\n<p>**This is less of a <em>concrete</em> goal, is perhaps more &#8230;&#8230;. <em>silken</em>. I want to make continuous progress toward my many-lifetime goal of transforming into a bodhisattva, reaching enlightenment for the sake of the enlightenment of other sentient beings. I&#8217;ve written about this many times on <a href=\"http://mindmindful.wordpress.com\">MindMindful</a>, so I won&#8217;t go into it much right here. Suffice it to say, that I will continue to examine my mind by meditating, writing, &amp; avoiding excessively &amp; OBsessively distracting myself from This Present Moment. I will continue my efforts at seeing myself in the behaviors &amp; failings of others, &amp; vice versa. I will keep on making my heart more open, even when it hurts, &amp; when it&#8217;s veryvery frightening.</p>\n<p>**<a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/images1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-1852\" title=\"Laughing zebra   www.photo-dictionary.com\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/images1.jpg?w=183&#038;h=275\" alt=\"\" width=\"183\" height=\"275\" /></a>And, I will keep on laughing, &amp; helping others to find that giggle that trumps their frown. This goal is also not so <em>concrete</em>. More &#8230;&#8230;. like &#8230;&#8230; <em>bubbles!</em>\u00a0In reminding myself &amp; everyone else to look for the funny story in whatever situation they may be in, I will be aiding all of us in staying present, no matter the situation. This will help us all turn our minds from the habit that nearly all of us have: grousing about the circumstances of any given moment, rather than celebrating what&#8217;s best about it. Maybe we will all have a little more gratitude this way, &amp;, if nothing else, we&#8217;ll all get to have an entertaining moment as we laugh the troubles off later.</p>\n<p>And with this one I realize I&#8217;ve strayed into the Infectious Hope section, so yea for me!!

Make a friend. I&#8217;ve said it before and I&#8217;ll say it again; my social life is entirely an online experience. It&#8217;s so weird. I feel like I can start a conversation with anyone, chat for what many would consider an inappropriate length of time with a complete stranger and never feel even remotely self-conscious. When I try and translate that over into an ongoing friendship, however, I freeze up. I have no idea why I do this. I always feel that I&#8217;m being somehow presumptuous when I try and instigate a friendship. When it comes right down to it, I&#8217;m a great big scaredy cat who doesn&#8217;t want to risk the possible rejection from someone who may only be humouring me in conversation, but really has no intention of ever really being my friend. Well, this week I&#8217;m going to throw caution to the wind and start throwing out invitations left and right. What&#8217;s the worse that could happen? They&#8217;ll say no. In that case I&#8217;m really no worse off than I am right now, except my ego may be a bit bruised. Well, that&#8217;s nothing I can&#8217;t handle. So, to heck with rejection, I&#8217;m going to try and make a friend.</p>\n<p>My plan of action for this is to contact every one of my facebook friends that still live in my area and try to reconnect with them. I&#8217;m also going to invite some of the women (or men) at our weekly playgroup over for a playdate with the kids. My third plan is probably going to sound a bit desperate, but seeing that there are already a dozen or more ads on there for this sort of thing it doesn&#8217;t bother me. I&#8217;m going to place an ad online. Hey, why not? We live in a technological age, I might as well take advantage of it and use the free classifieds to find something that I really need. Even if all I get out of it is someone to go see a chick flick with once a month, I&#8217;ll be thrilled. I&#8217;m ready to take whatever the Universe is ready to give me.</p>\n<p>2. My second short term goal is something I&#8217;ve been thinking about for a while. As some of you may know, I&#8217;m a bit of a shutter bug. (Shameless self promotion is 3&#8230; 2&#8230; 1) You can see some of my work <a title=\"Sustainable Utopia Photography\" href=\"http://sustainableutopiaphotography.wordpress.com/2012/02/07/photography/\">here</a>. Currently, when I do make money from my photography it&#8217;s by shooting weddings or family portraits. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I love doing this (well, if I&#8217;m being honest, I don&#8217;t really like the weddings.\u00a0 I don&#8217;t like to charge a lot of money because I think everyone deserves awesome wedding pictures, but it&#8217;s a long day, hours and hours of editing and just a lot of work. But I do like taking family portraits), but my real passion with photography is the art part of it. I would love nothing more than to know that a picture that I took, edited and poured a little bit of myself into was hanging on someone&#8217;s wall.</p>\n<p>I know that I can&#8217;t make someone buy my art, but I certainly can&#8217;t expect someone to buy it if I&#8217;ve never made the attempt to have it shown. So that&#8217;s my next short term goal. I&#8217;m going to become a member of my local artists coalition and submit my work to be displayed in their gallery. They&#8217;re a pretty awesome organization. If my portfolio is accepted, they&#8217;ll display my photos in their gallery, help promote me by putting my work into exhibits, or even helping to organize an exhibit just my own. They also have relationships with local businesses who display the art in their establishments. So really, even if I never sell a single photo, they will be displayed in coffee shops and doctors offices for all to see.</p>\n<p>3. My third goal is health related. For the most part, I&#8217;m a pretty healthy person. Good blood pressure, amazing immune system, no heart problems, good blood sugar, etc. I am, however, having extreme difficulties with my digestive track. I have been having extreme tummy troubles for at least the last four years, and I was never exactly normal before that. Yesterday, at the ripe old age of just 28, I had a colonoscopy to help figure out what is going on. Now, I know that there is nothing I can do to influence the results, but I can start to make myself more comfortable. Because I&#8217;m currently starting with a clean slate, so to speak, as there&#8217;s still nothing inside of me, I&#8217;m going on a mission to find out what&#8217;s causing the most trouble. I&#8217;m going to go on a monofood diet. What this means is that everyday, all day, I will only eat one type of food. Every time I find something that causes the upset, I&#8217;m going to write it down. If the last year has taught me anything about the practice of medicine and the health system in general, it&#8217;s that the absolute best thing you can do to be healthy is to do the research and look out for yourself. An elimination diet may not be the best long term solution for whatever is ailing me, but it&#8217;s certainly something that I can actively do right now to positively alter my situation. I&#8217;m already feeling good about this goal. All I&#8217;ve had today is cottage cheese, and I&#8217;m happy to report that it is staying down and I have yet to feel any rumblings from below.</p>\n<p><strong></strong>Long Term Goal</p>\n<p>Now, before I go and disappoint you all, my long term goal is a completely selfish goal. It&#8217;s not spiritual, it&#8217;s not deep or noble or anything that will save humanity. It&#8217;s for me, pure and simple. Aside from my family, my greatest passion in life is fiber. I love to knit, crochet, weave, and most of all, I love to spin my own yarns. I&#8217;m not really a fiber snob, because I love to spin anything and everything. So, my long term goal is actually something that not only will I never complete, but I&#8217;ll be highly disappointed if I do manage to complete it in this lifetime. My goal is to spin as many different and exotic fibers as I am able to. Anything that is\u00a0 stringy or fluffy, I want to spin it. You know what, sometimes that&#8217;s not even a requirement. My favourite yarn that I have spun to date had lace, feathers and pearls in it, hardly fluffy materials. Look, isn&#8217;t it pretty?</p>\n\n\t\t<style type='text/css'>\n\t\t\t#gallery-1857-1 {\n\t\t\t\tmargin: auto;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t#gallery-1857-1 .gallery-item {\n\t\t\t\tfloat:

I know I do.  Or at least I did.  Until I learned Forgiveness.  But what is forgiveness?  Does it mean we are simply supposed to forget the past.  To pretend it didn&#8217;t happen and move forward never thinking about it again?</p>\n<p>Forgiveness starts with yourself.  And it arrives from Awareness.  It arrives from remembering our past, and honestly confronting the mistakes which bring us regret.  It comes from taking ownership of the role you played in your mistake.  And it is solidified when we make the decision to never make that mistake again.  Forgiveness does not arrive from pretending everything we did was perfectly acceptable.  Forgiveness arrives when we accept that what we did was wrong and take measures to ensure our actions are never repeated.</p>\n<p>It turns out that Loving ourselves it tightly linked to our ability to Forgive ourselves.  I know this because for a long time I did not Love myself.  I also did not forgive myself.  I had ruined all of my relationships, I had lost money, respect, dignity and pride.  Such a fool.  And I can never take it back.  But I can move forward with forgiveness and Love and make sure I never act like a fool again.  I can look at my mistakes and try to figure out what caused me to react in the way I did.  I can identify the triggers so that I recognize them in the future.  And I can begin to Trust myself again.</p>\n<p>The funny thing about forgiving yourself in this manner, is that you start to come to a realization.  You start to see that you are not at all perfect.  That you have made many mistakes.  Some small, but others large.  You have hurt people.  Sometimes on purpose, sometimes unintentionally.  Sometimes we do not even know we have hurt people until years later.  But if we can do these things, and still deserve to be forgiven, then surely others deserve forgiveness as well.  In fact, before we can ever truly forgive others and honestly carry no grudges, we must first come to this crucial realization.  The realization that if we deserve forgiveness despite our transgressions, so do others as well.</p>\n<p>If we do not first learn to forgive ourselves, our forgiveness of others will never be truly sincere.  It will always feel tainted, forced or somehow like we have compromised and lost.  We must be able to accept that all people are human.  All people make mistakes.  But that does not mean they intended to hurt you.  And even if they did it does not mean they still wish to hurt you.  And even if they do, it does not mean they know what they are doing.  Forgiveness must start with ourselves.  It must come from the realization that we have screwed up, over and over again, yet we know we are still good people, deep down in our hearts.  We can live in shame and regret and denial.  Or we can look at our past with honesty and compassion and begin the long process of forgiving ourselves.</p>\n<p>And in the end, once you master forgiving yourself, you start to see a new pattern appear.  Most, not all, but most of the suffering in your life has come from <strong>not</strong> forgiving others when they make a mistake.  From taking offense to silly comments.  From rewinding a nasty scenario over and over in your head.  From resentments and regrets and grudges.  Most of the suffering in our lives comes from our inability to forgive.  If we just forgave people, we would soon start to see that nothing they can do can ever harm us.  Because we know who we are.  We know how we got here.  And we know we deserve to be Loved.  So how could any other person&#8217;s actions change that?</p>\n<p>I have made mistakes.  I have hurt many people in the past.  But in the end, it was never my intention to hurt them.  I was usually just being selfish, or blind, or impatient.  I forgive myself because I know that I am done with those days of Selfishness.  I am done being blind.  I am ready to live in Love.</p>\n<p>And I forgive you.  Please know I forgive you.  It doesn&#8217;t matter what you did.  It doesn&#8217;t matter why you did it.  I still Love you.  As long as you still Love me, then I will always forgive you.</p>\n", "post_id": 1873, "location": false, "date": "04-27-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["emotion", "alternate", "love", "cancer", "give", "age of aquarius", "gemini", "thanks", "selfishness", "alternative", "hate", "fear", "film", "astrology", "gratitude", "selfish", "story", "inheritance", "peace", "writing", "passion", "happiness", "remorse", "receiving", "hope", "economy", "compassion", "joy", "aquarius", "judgement", "protection", "security", "loss", "receive", "freedom", "foolishness", "movies", "universe", "hatred", "balance", "greed", "generosity"], "text": "<p><em>Today we have a new contributor to the 8 Week Challenge.  <a href=\"http://sharingitforward.wordpress.com/\">Sharing it Forward</a> has joined the challenge and has submitted this essay for her week of Generosity.

My grand-kids are Rylie (3) and Alana (1). On Wednesday I left early so I could spend some time with my daughter before she left and I wanted to take Alana to the park.</p>\n<p>It was a great time for her and me too to spend some alone time together.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/alana-april-2012-11-hamilton-park.jpg\"><img src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/alana-april-2012-11-hamilton-park.jpg?w=112&#038;h=149\" alt=\"\" title=\"alana-april-2012-11-hamilton-park\" width=\"112\" height=\"149\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1880\" /></a>        </p>\n<p>My daughter and her new boyfriend left to celebrate Easter with his Grandmother who she was meeting for the first time. I spent the night and the next day playing and taking care of the kids.  Then I brought Rylie home with me and he stayed until Sunday. He spends every other Thursday-Sunday with me. He is one of the best babies I know and very sweet and sympathetic for his age.  But, he had some things in store for me this weekend.</p>\n<p>I quit counting how many times I had to put him in time out. He refused to sleep or nap even to the point I had to wipe his eyes with cold rags because they burned for sleep. I talked to him about the changes in his life and how they were impacting him.  He can\u2019t tell me how he feels so he was doing a pretty good job of showing me.</p>\n<p>I kept my cool when he decided to get up during nap time (I was participating in nap time too) and emptied all the coffee in the house onto the couch and painted the couch so pretty with my favorite bottle of fingernail polish or even the two gallons of milk he spilled on the kitchen floor.</p>\n<p>With my compassion and love that I have for this little boy I fulfilled my True Sharing without even realizing it. I spent almost four days giving him the attention that he is craving and understanding the hurt that he is feeling inside. I kept my promise to love him unconditionally by keeping discipline constant and showing and telling him how I love him and how special of a person he is becoming.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/rylie-april-2012.jpg\"><img src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/rylie-april-2012.jpg?w=138&#038;h=149\" alt=\"\" title=\"rylie-april-2012\" width=\"138\" height=\"149\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1882\" /></a></p>\n<p>This past week was a difficult week for me to touch on things that I\u2019ve done because I usually go into town to the gym everyday but didn\u2019t make it everyday so I have to be\u2026lets say\u2026creative with some of my days.</p>\n<p>On Monday I got a call from my friend saying that \u201cI needed to come quickly because someone was freaking out\u201d. That\u2019s it, that was my explanation.  I didn\u2019t ask any questions, she lives less than a minute away so I hopped in my car and drove down there.  When I arrived she and her soon-to-be daughter-in-law sat at the kitchen table looking as casual as any other day.</p>\n<p>I thought, maybe I\u2019m at the wrong place? What was so urgent? So I sat down and began to listen. After a short explanation my friends soon-to-be daughter-in-law, let\u2019s call her Sam. Well, Sam has some mental issues and is dealing with getting on Social Security Disability at a young age, she will be 41 this year. She\u2019s having issues getting the information correctly both to SS and her lawyer. My friend, knowing that I\u2019ve also been through the same process in my 30\u2032s called to me for help (I have medical memory problems as well as other issues). So I stayed to help her the best I could.</p>\n<p>My friend left after a while saying that Sam needed to be around people her age that understood what she was going through.  Now, I already knew Sam through my friend but it was kind of an awkward moment.  I didn\u2019t know what to say, so I listened and asked questions that required a response from her.</p>\n<p>After a few minutes Sam started crying. I\u2019m ashamed to admit that my first instinct was to run to my car\u2026drive home and cuddle up on my couch and never answer my phone ever again.  I\u2019m nowhere near the point to deal with my own emotional problems and Sam\u2019s were too close for comfort.</p>\n<p>But I didn\u2019t run, I stayed.  It\u2019s not a fun day when you realize after a long battle at trying to keep a job(s) that you are no longer able to be a part of society in that way.  It\u2019s like a death of part of yourself.  And my friend was right, I was able to help Sam because I knew where those tears were coming from. I didn\u2019t rush her, instead waited for her to finish. We had a real deep conversation until she had to go. She asked me to come up the next day because she was going to start her new medication, Lithium.  She wanted my friend and me to watch her for possible side effects.</p>\n<p>I came up the next day and we all sat around the kitchen table, drank coffee and Sam faxed some SSDI paperwork to her attorney. Sam said she felt real good in the morning. It hadn\u2019t even been 24 hours since she started taking her new medication so we will be keeping an eye on her, making sure she doesn\u2019t have any negative side effects. I also called her on the phone throughout the week to remind her that I was there for her and stopped by on my way home the other day. She says she feels a little better but is still having issues with sleeping at night.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday I went to Curves in a desperate attempt to collect endorphins. I always feel better after Curves and Wednesday was no different.</p>\n<p>While I was out I made it my mission to sprinkle around some situational generosity. So often I see people wearing something or being their best and I think about it in my mind but don\u2019t always say it.  If you look hard enough you will find that most everyone has something that can positively commented on. But the people who deserve the compliment never get it if I keep it in my mind.</p>\n<p>A woman was leaving Curves as I was coming in.  She was wearing the sheerest, springy blouse that was really becoming on her. I told her that I  loved her top and that it looked great on her.  She thanked me, smiled and went on her way.  Maybe she thought about this later in the day when she took it off too.  It makes me feel good to make other people feel good.  Why don\u2019t I do this more often? I realize now that it\u2019s more of a conscious decision to make, much more so than entering a room wearing a smile which is something I always do.</p>\n<p>Another thing I discovered is that situational generosity doesn\u2019t have as much to do with the people I choose to sprinkle, but more with how I\u2019m feeling at that moment. It\u2019s kind of like the saying, \u201cWhat goes around comes around\u201d. What\u2019s ironic about this is, how I\u2019m feeling at any given moment is highly dependent on the actions of others and whether I\u2019ve been sprinkled lately.<br />\nThis is my Generosity Essay for the 8 week challenge offered by Alternate Economy/Daring to Live in Love.

My Mother suffered from depression so having a child with such a lively nature was wearing on her. I was also very religious, something I got from joining an after school bible class my friends had joined. Day School Gospel League.

I had been given spending money by my Grandmother and was standing at the candy counter during intermission waiting to choose my treat. The smaller child in front of me was short of money for their chosen candy so I stepped forward and offered a nickel.  I was always impulsive and the gesture was instantly accepted which left me short for my own treat when I got to the front of the line. Empty handed I walked back to my seat. I can&#8217;t say I wasn&#8217;t disappointed but I wasn&#8217;t angry either. I just accepted the inevitable and made a note to self to practice my math.

Hope is the aspect of Emotion that can sometimes appear to be the most illusive.  It is very vague in its definition.  Perhaps we would be wise to review the negative expression of hope first.  The one thing that is most destructive to our feelings of hope, is fear.  At first it may not appear to be so, but upon closer inspection we will find that this is the truth.  Fear causes us to shut down and retreat from things that we do not trust.  For us to experience fear, we must first have experienced love.  Let us take the most common fear as an example; the fear of death.  For many, the fear of death is the ultimate fear.  We do everything in our power to avoid death.  But this is only because we love life.  If we did not love our life we would not care if we lost it.  What we truly fear is losing something we love; life. We do not really fear death.  We don&#8217;t really know what death is.  We fear the unknown.  It would seem that what we fear most is change whose outcome we are unable to predict.</p>\n<p>Since most fears in life can be reduced to a basic fear of the unknown, this leads us to avoid change.  Or at least, to monitor change in a very distrustful way.  This unwillingness to change due to a fear of the unknown creates a lack of motivation.  We soon find ourselves avoiding most new things in life simply because they are new.  Fear is the selfish form of hope.  When we live in fear we are concerned only with keeping things the same, so that our comfort is not disturbed.  But fear has a nasty habit of perpetuating itself, as all selfish forms of emotion do.  When we are fearful we are unable to trust.  Trust is not the opposite of fear, but it is an essential component to hope.  Our lack of trust causes us to assume that we should be fearful of most situations in our lives.  Especially when we have a multi-billion dollar media industry that feeds off of peoples fear.  We are bombarded with images, sound bites and video clips of reasons to be distrustful of other humans.  This distrust causes us to assume the worst in the people in our lives.  Since we have convinced ourselves that those around us are wishing harm upon us, we begin to care less if harm comes to them.  If they do not do something to reinforce our feelings of fear first, then we are going to do something to reinforce theirs. </p>\n<p>When we are unable to trust those around us, we often lash out at the slightest provocation.  Because we have assumed that all people are selfish and will eventually harm us, we have become selfish.  Yet most times we learn only too late that we have misunderstood the situation.  We lash out too quickly and push away a person who did not actually intend us harm.  Fear again enters and stops us from reconciling with that person.  Now we fear they will reject us.  In the end we have lost a potential friend due to fear and one misunderstanding.</p>\n<p>Fear is cyclical in nature.  When we live in fear, we are unable to trust which causes us to push away those we love, which reinforces a sense of isolation and again breeds more fear.  Hope is the opposite expression of fear.  When we live in hope, we trust those we love which causes us act positively, which reinforces a sense of support and breeds more hope.</p>\n<p>Hope is not so much a dream, or a desire.  Hope is the feeling you get when you take a positive action towards achieving your goals.  It really doesn&#8217;t matter what your goals are, you become hopeful when you take a step closer to achievement.  But hope cannot exist when fear is present.  Fear causes us to avoid change by sapping us of our motivations.  Hope causes us to seek change by empowering us to take positive actions.  The more steps we take towards our goal, the stronger our feeling of hope.</p>\n<p>Hope requires patience as well.  Not every positive action will equal a success.  We will also be confronted with many failures in life.  When we live in fear we take each failure as a confirmation that we should not attempt to change.  This is the selfish form of our emotions.  It is selfish because we assume that the world is out to get us, and that we will never succeed because we are destined for failure.  When we live in hope we see that every failure is in fact a lesson.  If we possess the patience to endure our failures and instead begin to assess each success and failure in an attempt to perfect our plan, hope will remain.  By taking the time between each step to assess what we have learned from that positive action, we soon find that we have fewer and fewer failures to endure.  Hope allows us to learn from our mistakes and move forward in the pursuit of our goals. </p>\n<p>Hope comes from a position of gratitude.  When we receive our first success on the road to achieving our goal, we cannot help but be grateful.  Not to anyone in particular, but to life in general.  This gratitude spreads.  If anyone has helped us in achieving our step, we will surely express our excitement and gratitude to them.  This will make them more inclined to help us in the future.  Not to mention that hope is just as infectious as fear.  The more we see others live in a state of hope, the harder it is to justify living in a state of fear. </p>\n<p>Fear is a wounded emotion.  It comes from a lack of trust and only creates more fear.  When we live in fear the expectation is that change brings us pain.  It is a selfish emotion, because it shifts our focus inward in a negative way.  In our attempt to protect ourselves from harm, we instead block ourselves from everything.  By assuming the worst in those around us, and refusing to trust in those we love, we ultimately reinforce our fears.  Before we learn the truth of a situation we shut down and retreat, generally lashing out at the nearest person in the process.  Sometimes this response is justified, but often it is not.  By the time you have realized that you were not in any danger, it is too late.  The damage is done. </p>\n<p>Hope is a healthy emotion.  It comes from positive actions and the patience to endure our failures.  Hope comes from gratitude, because it shifts our focus onto the possibilities in life and the people that helped us get there.  When we learn from our mistakes and press forward we create hope around us.  Hope is akin to inspiration.  It builds upon itself and spreads to others. It comes from the patience to perfect your ideas.  Hope brings balance, because evaluating our mistakes and learning from them generally leads to fewer mistakes.  In the end we are able to control our emotions in order to guide our positive actions in the direction that we desire them to go.  Hope creates balanced emotions, through patience and knowledge.</p>\n<p>Read Next:</p>\n<table width=\"250\" border=\"1\" bgcolor=\"#99ccff\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://alternate-economy.com/wordpress/blog/2012/01/02/passion/\">Passion</a>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.alternate-economy.com\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.alternate-economy.com/Images/banner-alternate-economy.jpg\" alt=\"The Alternate Economy\" width=\"450\"></a></p>\n", "post_id": 1904, "location": false, "date": "04-30-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Alternate Economy", "Dismal Science", "Economic"], "text": "<div>My association with Alternate Economy began with an exchange of comments to a MiNdFuLnEsS MoMeNt I posted on my own blog,\u00a0<a href=\"http://mindmindful.wordpress.com\">MindMindful</a>\u00a0&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; &amp; now I&#8217;m\u00a0AltEcon&#8217;s\u00a0Twitter tweeter!!

And, evidenced by the Occupy Wall Street movement, the current recession &amp; every political gasbag, talk about &#8220;the economy&#8221; is seemingly fraught with confrontational &amp; adversarial positions. People, if they have any knowledge of economics at all, tend to divide into different schools of thought, &amp; commence\u00a0to argue. The topic of &#8220;economics&#8221; is seen by many as abstruse &amp; arcane, as bleak &amp; blustering, as dreary &amp; drab &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. in short, <em>dismal</em>.\u00a0\u00a0 I think it&#8217;s safe to say that few people find much <em>hope</em>\u00a0in economics, not much spirituality, or even very much of anything that directly relates to their own daily lives. Econ just is not felt to be ver<a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/generous-world-hands.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-1913\" title=\"Generous world hands\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/generous-world-hands.jpg?w=144&#038;h=149\" alt=\"\" width=\"144\" height=\"149\" /></a>y approachable. I mean, how touchy-feely\u00a0does the &#8216;Empress of the Social Sciences&#8217; inspire YOU to be?!?</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the thing though: The economy IS veryvery\u00a0spiritual, in the sense that it depends upon the beliefs, hopes &amp; personal myths of individuals &amp; businesses, &amp; their willingness or reluctance to exchange with each other. The word &#8216;economy&#8217; comes from the Greek &#8216;oikos&#8217;, which means &#8216;household.&#8217; EVERYbody lives in a household, in one form or another, &amp; so it is true: Economics is intimately attached to every aspect of our lives. And it is our <em>attitudes toward &amp; our beliefs about</em> money, finances, wealth, sharing, etc that creates what we call The Economy<em>.</em> As if it is outside of ourselves.<em> As if we have nothing to do with it.<a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/reflected-back.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-1917\" title=\"Reflected back\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/reflected-back.jpg?w=127&#038;h=149\" alt=\"\" width=\"127\" height=\"149\" /></a></em></p>\n<p>The truth of it, though, is that the economy, <em>economics</em>, more than many facets of life, reflects the play of consciousness of all the entities within it. It mirrors back to its constituents what they most believe. So, when fear &amp; uncertainty are the prevailing emotions &#8230;&#8230;..?? What do they tell us about ourselves? They tell us that we have given up our personal power to those who will use it against us &#8230;&#8230; &amp; that we need to continue to do this because &#8220;they&#8221; are the ones who will take care of us in the long run. These emotions make us collectively feel we need to hold onto our own, to defend ourselves &amp; what we have from those who would take it &#8230;&#8230;.. &amp; that some elements of society will always have muchmuch\u00a0more than everybody else. And they tell us that hope &#8230;&#8230; &amp; love &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. &amp; connectedness have no place in our shared, public life &#8230;&#8230;.. when, really, these are the very qualities that will get us out of the current national/global financial crisis. It is love, hope, interconnection, generosity, caretaking of each other that are the answers to the existential lamentation: &#8220;<a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/mind-awhirl.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-1915\" title=\"Changing the world with our minds\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/mind-awhirl.jpg?w=148&#038;h=149\" alt=\"\" width=\"148\" height=\"149\" /></a>Why do I have so much, but I feel so empty?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Which brings me back to <a title=\"The Alternate Economy\" href=\"http://www.alternate-economy.com\">The Alternate Economy</a>. These creative folks (full disclosure: myself, recently included) propose an economy of generosity, one NOT based on profit at all costs, which promotes &amp; rewards greed. This alternate economy will instead promote &amp; reward sharing, &amp; people doing productive work they love. It involves chartering a bank, &amp; democratically deciding which projects &amp; businesses to fund. It promises to be <em>participatory</em>, &amp; not <em>predatory</em>. Wait, you say. An economy based on taking care of each other? An economic life which values generosity above greed?! YES! And THAT is an economy I want mirrored back to me &#8212; one that reflects the highest, &amp; noblest aspirations of the human soul, rather than the consciousness of &#8216;only the strongest, most mercenary survive&#8217;.</p>\n<p>This excerpt from The Alternate Economy&#8217;s <a title=\"Alternate Economy Mission Statement\" href=\"http://alternate-economy.com/missionstatement.htm\">Mission Statement</a> reveals where my personal aspirations most clearly intersect with this grand, yet humble social construct:<a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/images5.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-1914\" title=\"Yin/Yang generosity\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/images5.jpg?w=150&#038;h=134\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"134\" /></a></p>\n<blockquote><p><em>The first step to making this change is by changing our expectations of life.

I&#8217;m actually not kidding about this. I&#8217;ve done some googling this morning, and (at least according to various interviews he&#8217;s given) his ideals sync up pretty well with ours.

But I maintain they are different things. Passion is in fact a form of Love, not the be all and end all of Love. Passions arise when we feel a certain connection to the object of our Love. They are cultivated when we allow ourselves an honest appraisal of our new Love. And they become reality when we allow ourselves to become immersed in them.</p>\n<p>But Passion is a slippery slope. It can often lead to imbalances, rather than bringing balance. This generally happens when we refuse to see the truth behind our passion. Nothing is perfect and neither is our passion. That does not make it less deserving of our Love. It in fact makes our passion more deserving of our Love. When we are able to live in balanced Passion, we begin to see that it is precisely because the object of our passion is not yet perfect that we Love it so much. We wish to add to it. To help it become perfect. And so it becomes our passion.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/badge.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1497\" title=\"badge\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/badge.jpg?w=300&#038;h=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>This Weeks Challenge</strong></p>\n<p>This week&#8217;s challenge for Passion will require that you take some time to sit and honestly ask yourself what your passions are and why you are passionate about those things. You will be asked to reminisce. To confront your past honestly. And to look to the future with a new awareness. Passion arrives when we allow ourselves the opportunity to become lost in the object of our Love. But we can still become lost with a sense of purpose. We can immerse ourselves in the truth of our passions. We can learn every facet there is to know about them. And then we can share our new found Love with everyone around us.</p>\n<p>The following examples are suggestions only. Feel free to incorporate as many of them into your daily life as you are able to, or create your own examples of Passion.</p>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:awards@alternate-economy.com\">Send Entries to awards@alternate-economy.com</a></p>\n<p>The following challenge is split into three categories. Please complete each category and send an email with an essay describing how your week of Living in Passion has changed you. This essay can be anywhere from 500 to 1000 words and will become a post on this blog.</p>\n<table width=\"150\" border=\"1\" bgcolor=\"#99ccff\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;\" align=\"center\"><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.wordpress.com/2012/05/09/honest-passion/\">Honest Passion</a></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Honest Passion is the ability to look at the object of your affection and know exactly why you Love this person or thing. It comes from an honest assessment of your passion and your relation to it. Often times we get caught up in Loving our Passions so much we forget to stop and ask ourselves why we Love them. By getting to know our relationship with our passion, we help to better get to know both ourselves and the object of our affection.</p>\n<p>For this week, choose one person or activity that you are passionate about. Write a list of honest pros and cons about your relationship with this passion. With every con you find, try to rationalize why this con actually makes you Love your passion more. By getting to know your Passion truthfully, you can only bring yourself closer to it.</p>\n<table width=\"150\" border=\"1\" bgcolor=\"#99ccff\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;\" align=\"center\"><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.wordpress.com/2012/05/08/exploratory-passion/\">Exploratory Passion</a></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>A sense of Passion does not arrive on its own. There must be some willingness to explore on your part. For this week try to think of a thing you imagine you are passionate about but have never tried. Or pick something that you &#8220;used to be&#8221; Passionate about and rekindle your exploration of this Passion. Either way, make sure to leave the house and engage your passions this week. There is no better feeling than doing something you Love.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Join a sports team, be it a fantasy league online or a real team with real people in the real outdoors.<br />\n\u2022 Take some lessons in a subject that has always fascinated you. You can sign up for a class, or even just go to the local college and audit the course for free. You will be surprised how a little knowledge on the matter can open doors for you.<br />\n\u2022 Set aside some quiet time to begin a new or old hobby. Try to get to know your Passion and remember why it is that you wanted your alone time in the first place.<br />\n\u2022 Introduce yourself to that one person. You know the one I mean. The one that makes you nervous every time you see them. The one that makes your throat dry and your mind suddenly blank. Go and talk to them. Just talk. No expectations. No plans for the future. Just introduce yourself and see what happens.</p>\n<table width=\"150\" border=\"1\" bgcolor=\"#99ccff\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;\" align=\"center\">Shared Passion</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>I lied. There is one thing better than doing what you Love. It is doing what you Love with someone you Love. For this weeks challenge, try to set aside some time to include someone you Love in your Passions. Whether you decide to share the fruit of your Passions with them, or the knowledge which allowed you to create that fruit, it matters little. But do your best to include as many people in your Passions as possible and watch your Passion grow.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Invite your friends over for a hobby night. Get each person to bring some info on their hobbies while you do the same for yours. Take the time to listen to what your friends are presenting. You may find that they share a hobby with you, or even better, that their hobby compliments yours somehow.<br />\n\u2022 Put on a performance for your local community. Get out there and shine. Whether your passion is poetry, acting, music or even activism, bring your show to your neighbours. They want to see it, trust me, so don&#8217;t deny them your talents.<br />\n\u2022 Spend the day producing your Passion and then gift the products to those you Love. If you knit, then knit. If you cook, go ahead and cook. If you dance, offer some lessons. Whatever it is you do, do it well and share it freely.<br />\n\u2022 Try one of your Lover&#8217;s Passions. Even if it is not one of your own, you would be amazed how just watching your Loved one get immersed in their Passion has a way of lifting your spirits.</p>\n<p><a

that some of you may feel that I have unfair expectations of humanity.\u00a0 It is obvious I have come from a privileged life.\u00a0 It is nice that I am able to boast about living in love, but obviously I have never had to face any real challenges, or I would know that the world is a cold and cruel place.\u00a0 In the real world my writings are a nice fantasy to retreat to, but are nothing more than that.\u00a0 There is no future in my words.\u00a0 Because we all know people just aren&#8217;t cut out to love one another.\u00a0 Maybe the privileged ones can live this way. but they are few and far between.\u00a0 Plus, they have never known true suffering, so of course they will think a utopia is possible.\u00a0 It is only a delusion, however.\u00a0 In the real world, love is an ideal, not a reality.</p>\n<p>Hmmm&#8230; How to respond to this.\u00a0 I&#8217;m not sure how to splash a glass of ice water in someone&#8217;s face verbally.\u00a0 The words &#8220;wake up&#8221; seem appropriate.\u00a0 I will agree with you.\u00a0 The world is a cold and cruel place.\u00a0 It is also true that everyone on this planet, and I do mean every single person currently alive, has suffered.\u00a0 The thing about suffering is that it is a personal story.\u00a0 For some the suffering in their life is obvious.\u00a0 Some simply cannot afford to eat.\u00a0 Some are sold as children to the sex trade.\u00a0 Some brutally beaten by their parents.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I will not deny I came from a privileged life.\u00a0 I have suffered far less than anyone else I know.\u00a0 I am truly lucky.\u00a0 But I see this privilege as a responsibility.\u00a0 Who better to share the wealth of love than someone so privileged as to receive it in such vast quantities.</p>\n<p>But to assume my life has been without suffering is a little insulting.\u00a0 I was born into a white middle class family in Canada that loved me.\u00a0 For that I am eternally grateful.\u00a0 There is no more privileged a position in our world, that I can tell.\u00a0 But that is pretty much where it stops.\u00a0 My father was an alcoholic.\u00a0 Not a particularly abusive one, but more of an absentee.\u00a0 My grandmother was also an alcoholic, although she was more of the abusive kind.\u00a0 My mother attempted to raise me while coping with her mother&#8217;s abuse and my father&#8217;s absenteeism.\u00a0 My grandmother killed herself when I was seven, which smartened my dad up and got him to quit drinking.\u00a0 The damage was done, however, and my parents divorced.\u00a0 They stopped talking to each other directly, and instead sent angry messages to one another through me.\u00a0 In highschool I became very introverted, partially because I had developed very severe acne.\u00a0 I had no real friends for about 3 years during highschool.\u00a0 I would tag along behind a group of outcasts, but even they did not really like me that much.\u00a0 They were too nice to tell me, but I\u00a0knew that I was never really invited.\u00a0 I decided to take Accutane to help with my acne.\u00a0 This incredibly potent drug not only caused my skin to flake and peel off, but also gave me horrible pains deep in my hip bones.\u00a0 A couple of years later I started becoming very sick.\u00a0 I was having diarhhea pretty much constantly.\u00a0 Some days up to 15 times a day.\u00a0 Yet I was not eating anything.\u00a0 Anything I did eat just came straight out, so instead I tried starving myself to see if that would help.\u00a0 Amazingly it did nothing to stop the diarhhea.\u00a0 The doctor&#8217;s told me I had Crohn&#8217;s disease.\u00a0 After doing some research I realized that Accutane is often associated with the development of Crohn&#8217;s disease.\u00a0 My acne medicine had given me an auto-immune disease that is essentially the opposite of AIDS.\u00a0 Instead of my immune system shutting down, it has gone wild and is literally eating holes in my body.\u00a0 At first this was mostly in my small intestine.\u00a0 It soon spread to my anus.\u00a0 You can imagine the pain associated with this disease is rather severe.\u00a0 I had to have surgery to stop the spread of the fissures in my anus.</p>\n<p>I have received gifts of love many times.\u00a0 Once in University my great-grandmother gave me $10,000 to put towards my tuition.\u00a0 She gave it to me in October, though and I had already paid my tuition.\u00a0 So I decided to be smart and invest it.\u00a0 Every penny was stolen from me by an online scam artist.\u00a0 He got away with over $250,000 in people&#8217;s hard earned money and was never heard of again.\u00a0 Since that day I have struggled with massive debts.\u00a0 It turns out University is much more expensive than I imagined.\u00a0 That $10,000 would have been much better used to pay for food and rent.\u00a0 But I could hardly ask for more money now.\u00a0 I was so embarrased.\u00a0 So instead I applied for a visa with a $15,000 limit, which I received at the age of 21 with no real job, past or present.\u00a0 I paid for my University using my Visa card at 19% interest.\u00a0 8 years later I am still attempting to pay off the interest of that loan.\u00a0 The capital remains untouched.</p>\n<p>Welcome to my priviledged life.\u00a0 I know deep down in my heart that i am one of the lucky ones.\u00a0 That makes me so incredibly sad.\u00a0 If I am the priviledged one in this world, and I actually think that I am, then what does that say about our world?</p>\n<p>Maybe it is time to stop judging everyone against everyone else.\u00a0 I have suffered.\u00a0 You have suffered.\u00a0 My suffering may not seem like much to some.\u00a0 It may seem like an awful lot to others.\u00a0 But none of that matters.\u00a0 My suffering meant something to me.\u00a0 It was mine and mine alone.\u00a0 Only I can understand the complexity of emotions that go along with this story.\u00a0 Just like only you can understand the complexity of emotions that go along with your story.</p>\n<p>The point I am trying to make is that suffering is only what we make of it.\u00a0 Some days I cannot stand up straight because my stomach hurts so much.\u00a0 But I never call in sick.\u00a0 I never cancel my plans.\u00a0 I fight through the pain.\u00a0 I want to live my life, I will not allow pain to hold me back.</p>\n<p>The same goes for our personal stories of suffering.\u00a0 Yes, we have all suffered.\u00a0 You can either take that suffering and turn it into a life of pain and misery.\u00a0 You can focus on it selfishly and say to yourself that all the bad things in life only happen to you.\u00a0 Or, you can take your suffering and turn it into a lesson.\u00a0 You can see that measured against others, your suffering has not been that bad.\u00a0 Or maybe it has been much worse.\u00a0 Either way, you are still alive.\u00a0 You have survived your suffering, so you must be strong enough to take it.\u00a0\u00a0 So be strong.\u00a0 Take it.\u00a0 Take your suffering and turn it into love.\u00a0 If I can do it, so can anyone.\u00a0 It is not easy, I will not make that claim.\u00a0 But it is possible.</p>\n<p>When I was going to work today I parked my car in my usual spot.\u00a0 It is about two blocks from where I work.\u00a0 As I opened the car door I was immediately greeted with a freezing cold air.\u00a0 It is the first day to hit -7 degrees and the doors to the car were frozen shut when I tried to start it.\u00a0 Upon exiting the car all I could

I still maintain that passion is not quite the same as love, but is in fact a way of expressing it.  Passion has a positive and negative form, as all the expressions of emotion do.  In its positive expression it is what we most commonly refer to as love; although I feel that the word &#8220;adoration&#8221; is more appropriate.  Passion can also be expressed negatively.  Hatred is most definitely a passionate experience, but it is not at all the same as adoration.</p>\n<p>Hatred is passion expressed in anger.  When we feel hatred for something we react in one of two ways.  We either retreat into ourselves and avoid the object of our hatred at all costs.  Or we begin to plot and connive against the object of our hatred in an attempt to harm it.  Both of these forms are the selfish form of passion.  They are selfish because we feel justified in our hatred.</p>\n<p>Hatred always comes from love.  Let us use an example of hatred that is relatively benign.  Many people hate certain foods, such as mushrooms.  This hatred derives first from a love of food and pleasant flavours.  When we first start trying new foods we are very passionate about exploring new flavours.  When we encounter one that displeases us we begin to hate it.  Now we retreat into ourselves, avoiding that food for the rest of our lives.  But many people begin to realize as they age that their palates change.  People who hated mushrooms start to realize that there are many types of mushrooms, all of which taste different.  They start by experimenting with one type and realize it isn&#8217;t quite as bad as they remember it.  All of a sudden, they like mushrooms again.  They rarely begin to become passionate about mushrooms, but they are able to appreciate them and leave their position of hatred.  This is a story that is familiar to many of us.  How does this example apply to the rest of our passions?</p>\n<p>Passions do not arrive from logic.  They arrive from powerful emotions which create false assumptions.  We don&#8217;t hate mushrooms for any logical reason.  Often we don&#8217;t even actually hate the taste of mushrooms, we simply hate the idea of them.  I know many people who will tell you how much they enjoyed a meal until they find out that there were mushrooms pureed into the sauce.  All of a sudden their face screws up and they start to think to themselves that they obviously did not like that meal.  Even though they just said aloud that they did.  Hatred arrives when our passions cloud our judgment.  The emotional response takes over and logic is no longer allowed to have access.</p>\n<p>Hatred expresses itself in more than just benign situations, however.  When we point our hatred at an individual it is generally because we feel they have done us some sort of harm.  Whether they have spread rumours about us, or physically hurt us, or told us we are unintelligent; it matters little.  The end result is that in our emotional response to their offensive behaviour we begin to hate them.  The thing about hatred is it has a tendency to breed vengeance.  Vengeance is a selfish act.  It comes from the expectation that we are justified in hurting others because they have hurt us.  So once we have decided to hate someone, we often go out of our way to begin spreading rumours about them, getting into physical fights with them, and insulting their character.  When we do this, there is really only one scenario that will present itself.  The object of our hatred will continue to act negatively towards us.  Because now they hate us too.</p>\n<p>Hatred is cyclical.  When we live in hatred, we take every offense as an excuse to hate, which causes us to become vengeful, which creates hate in those around us.  There is another version of this cycle, which is a little more personal.  When we live in hatred, we also begin to avoid anything associated with the object of our hate, this causes us to have a lowered understanding of the object of our hate, which causes us to retreat deeper in hate.  Either way, hate creates more hate.  But hate is a selfish act.  Hatred implies a lack of knowledge and a large number of assumptions.  These assumptions are always very selfish in nature because they cause us to justify our hatred.</p>\n<p>Passion also has a positive expression; adoration.  Adoration is not really the healthy version of passion, though.  Health comes from balance, and adoration is not very balanced.  Adoration is putting the object of your passion on a pedestal.  When we do this we are still making assumptions about the object of our passion.  This time the assumption is that the object of our passion can do no wrong.  This causes us to defend them and stand behind them no matter what they do.  This could be a positive thing if it were coming from a position of compassion.  But in this case it is not quite the same as compassion and ultimately leads to a negative expression of passion.  When we blindly support our passions, we support them in health and woundedness.  When we support the object of our passions wounded emotions, we only perpetuate those wounded emotions in both ourselves and the object of our passion.  Adoration is the opposite of hatred, but it is not its healthy expression.</p>\n<p>A mother adores her child and feels they can do no wrong.  So when her child comes home from a fight in the schoolyard the mother quickly runs to her child and cleans them up.  All the while she reassures them that this is not their fault and that the other child is a terrible thing for doing this to their baby.  The mother does not ask how the fight started.  She does not want to hear that her adorable little child might have started that fight.  But what if the child did start the fight?  Now their mother is reinforcing in them that this was ok.  The mother is reinforcing hatred in their child through their blind adoration.  If the mother knew that she was actually harming her child, she would probably be horrified.  But adoration is just as wounded as hatred.  So she will not see that she is in fact harming her child.  She will instead begin to hate the child that hurt her child.  Adoration creates hatred.</p>\n<p>Now let us look at things from the child&#8217;s perspective.  The child knows that they started the fight.  When their mother showers them with adoration and tells them it was not their fault, they do not begin to adore their mother.  They begin to disrespect their mother for her ignorance.  They see that they are now able to get away with pretty much anything.  So they will try to get away with everything.  They are already living in hatred, which is a wounded emotion.  Now the child knows they can manipulate their mother.  Manipulation is a form of vengeance, because it is assuming that a person is receiving what they deserve.  When the child begins to manipulate their mothers adoration, they are in fact living in hatred.  The mother&#8217;s adoration has caused her child to hate her and treat her with no respect.  Adoration does not create adoration; it creates hatred.</p>\n<p>Balanced passions come from a position of gratitude.  When we live in adoration we are being selfish, because we are refusing to see the truth of the object of our passions.  Balanced passion is living in true love, because it is living with an understanding that the object of our passion is not perfect.  When we live in adoration we look at the object of our passions and see only what we can get from them.  The mother&#8217;s personal pride in her motherhood is at stake when her child makes a mistake.  She is unwilling to see her child&#8217;s faults, not because her child is perfect, but because she is selfish and refuses to admit that her parenting might not be perfect.  When we live in balanced passions we look at the object of our passions and see only what we can give to them.  This is the position of gratitude.  We are grateful to have our passion in our life, so we only want to see it succeed.  But in order to succeed our passion must first falter and make mistakes.  When we live in balanced passions we live in a position of knowledge.  The only assumption we have now is that when the object of our passion makes a mistake we are there to offer it guidance, in order that it does not repeat the mistake.</p>\n<p>We still adore our passion.  But we adore it with an understanding that it is not perfect.  It is this understanding that balances our passions.  It also balances hatred.  If we understand that the object of our hatred is not perfect we will be less likely to be offended by it.  Therefore we will not engage in vengeance or retreat from it.  When we live in balanced passions we start to see that everything is deserving of our adoration.  Within limits.  Nobody is perfect, but if we feel they are deserving of our love then we will want to help them grow.  This means being patient when they make mistakes.  Soon we will come to realize that the things we feel are deserving of our love make just as many mistakes as everyone else.  All of sudden everyone appears to be deserving of our love.</p>\n<p>Adoration and hatred are two forms of a wounded emotion.  They are not really that different, because they result in the same thing; hatred.  Hatred breeds hatred through vengeance, while adoration breeds hatred through a continued loss of respect.  Either way, hatred and adoration are selfish because we look at the object of our passion and only try to see what they are giving to us.</p>\n<p>True passion is balanced and is a healthy emotion. Balanced passions are cyclical.  When we live in true passion, we see that the object of our passion is not perfect, which causes us to love them more, which creates a feeling of supportiveness, which in turns causes us to realize that all souls are deserving of our love.  Balanced passions could be called love.  When we live in love we look at the object of our passions and try to see what we can give to them.  This is the grateful form of passion.  We are grateful to have our passion in our life, so we try only to help it grow.  This in turn creates gratitude in the object of our passion.  Balanced passions create true love.</p>\n<p>Read Next:</p>\n<table width=\"250\" border=\"1\" bgcolor=\"#99ccff\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://alternate-economy.com/wordpress/blog/2012/01/03/a-spirit-of-receiving/\">A Spirit of Receiving</a>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.alternate-economy.com\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.alternate-economy.com/Images/banner-alternate-economy.jpg\" alt=\"The Alternate Economy\" width=\"450\"></a></p>\n", "post_id": 1947, "location": false, "date": "05-02-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["emotion", "alternate", "love", "cancer", "give", "age of aquarius", "gemini", "thanks", "selfishness", "alternative", "hate", "fear", "film", "astrology", "gratitude", "selfish", "story", "inheritance", "peace", "writing", "passion", "happiness", "remorse", "receiving", "hope", "economy", "compassion", "joy", "aquarius", "judgement", "protection", "security", "loss", "receive", "freedom", "foolishness", "movies", "universe", "hatred", "balance", "greed", "generosity"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/the-girl-in-goma.jpg\"><img src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/the-girl-in-goma.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200\" alt=\"\" title=\"the-girl-in-goma\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1960\" /></a></p>\n<p>This post is going back to our week in Hope.  To give my example of Positive Action and how it can result in a stronger sense of Hope, I will be discussing my Love life.  I had made a point to open myself to new situations this week, in order to try to meet some new people.  I had resolved to greet new chances at Love with open arms and a smile.  So, here is my story.</p>\n<p>As you may remember, I went for lunch last Wednesday with my Grandfather and met a very attractive and friendly waitress.  It did not seem very appropriate to initiate a conversation at the time, but I did make a mental note to go back, alone, and see if I couldn&#8217;t strike up a conversation with her.</p>\n<p>So that is what I did.  I grabbed a pen and a pad of paper and went out for lunch solo two days ago, with the intention of writing for the blog and making a new friend.  When I arrived I could see it was quite busy.  Because I was not sure what her name was, and because I did not want to end up in someone else&#8217;s section, I decided to grab a seat at the bar, near the area where the servers pick up drinks.  After a few minutes of surveying the restaurant I came to the conclusion that my waitress from last week was not there.</p>\n<p>But I was on a mission, and I had come that far, so why not continue.  I had made to decision to leave myself open to any opportunity for more Love in my life, so why not talk to someone else?  There were two bartenders at first, both quite busy.  After a bit one of them took notice of me and informed me of the specials.  I decided to let the Universe take over and made sure to just try to make as much eye contact with her at first, as possible.  I truly believe the eyes are the window to the soul, and one of the best ways to communicate feelings of support and Love.</p>\n<p>I asked her what her favourite wine was and ordered a glass of that.  It was a sweeter Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand, Monkey&#8217;s Bay, I think.  A little sweet for my taste, but I enjoyed it all the same.  I then ordered a pasta and opened my notebook to start writing.  I didn&#8217;t say much at first, and she was pretty busy, so it was fine.  I just wrote.  And wrote.  And wrote.  I got 3 pages out before my food arrived and another 3 while eating.  She asked a bunch of questions throughout about how I was enjoying the food and wine.  I responded gently with full eye contact and a big smile.  As the bar started to empty and things started to wind down from the lunch rush, I could see that my bartender was eyeing the notebook relatively often.  So, when it came time for dessert, I put my pen down and engaged her a little more seriously.</p>\n<p>I told her to surprise me with dessert.  That I trusted her to make the right decision.  Then I asked her how long she had been working there.  Turns out she has been there for several years.  We talked a little about my work, also a restaurant.  We talked about how it is nice to feel like a family at work with your co-workers, and how I miss that a little, now that I work in such a small place.  We chatted about school and wine and even the weather.  In the end I asked her name and told her mine.  We shook hands and she told me to come back in soon so that we could chat some more.  And then I took my leave.</p>\n<p>It was nice.  Nice to know how easy it is to start a conversation with a stranger.  Nice to see someone meet my eyes when I hold onto theirs with mine.  It made me feel a little more confident.  Put a little spring in my step.  And it certainly has helped me to choose my new hangout.</p>\n<p>It is positive actions like these that keep Hope alive.  Hope does not come from getting what you want immediately.  Hope comes from taking small steps towards your goals and leaving room to enjoy the anticipation of finally getting what it is you Love.  I am going to go back again next week to see if I can&#8217;t have another conversation.  At this point, a little Hope is exactly what I need.</p>\n", "post_id": 1959, "location": false, "date": "05-03-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Sunday Post", "MindMindful", "passion", "WordPress"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/images.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-1964\" title=\"Aphrodite www.goddessofthemonth.mystaiofthemoon.com\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/images.jpg?w=183&#038;h=275\" alt=\"\" width=\"183\" height=\"275\" /></a>So, I have to say, I don&#8217;t really have any passions, nothing that I am consumed by in the way that <em>being passionate about something</em> usually means.

I know for me it is definitely the aspect of Love that I struggle with the most.  I even considered taking a &#8220;break&#8221; from the challenge for a week and allowing people to rest.  I even allowed one of the contest participants to convince me that it was a good idea to avoid Receiving for a week.</p>\n<p>Most people who live in Love feel it is better to give than to receive.  I do not agree.  It is better to give and receive equally.  If we give more than we receive we find that we run into emotional imbalances.  No matter how we try to justify it to ourselves, in the end we always feel like we are being neglected.  We like to say we are fine with never receiving, but how do we really feel about that?</p>\n<p>Receiving is difficult in this world, because it requires us to truly Love ourselves.  This is the big test.  This is the week where we find out if we actually Love ourselves, or if it is all an act.  Because in order to properly Receive Love, we must know in our hearts that we deserve to Receive that Love.  This comes from a position of self-confidence.  A position of knowledge and awareness of one&#8217;s worth.  We need to realize that we deserve to be spoiled just as much as those we spoil.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/badge.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1497\" title=\"badge\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/badge.jpg?w=300&#038;h=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>This Weeks Challenge</strong></p>\n<p>This week we will be concentrating on three areas of Receiving.  I will ask you to first start listening to those around you.  How often do we Receive compliments and not even realize it?  How often does someone reach out to us with Love only to be refused out of politeness?  How often do we say &#8220;no&#8221; to Love?  You might be shocked to learn the answer&#8230;</p>\n<p>But Receiving is not just about passively accepting compliments.  Receiving is also about actively engaging your Loved ones, so that they know what it is you require from them.  If we never tell someone we Love what we expect, obviously we will never Receive it.  Our Lovers cannot read our minds any better than we can read theirs.  Receiving starts with honestly admitting when you need help and ends when we actually allow someone to include themselves in our life. </p>\n<p>The following examples are suggestions only. Feel free to incorporate as many of them into your daily life as you are able to, or create your own examples of Receiving.</p>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:awards@alternate-economy.com\">Send Entries to awards@alternate-economy.com</a></p>\n<p>The following challenge is split into three categories. Please complete each category and send an email with an essay describing how your week of Living in the Spirit of Receiving has changed you. This essay can be anywhere from 500 to 1000 words and will become a post on this blog.</p>\n<table width=\"150\" border=\"1\" bgcolor=\"#99ccff\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;\" align=\"center\"><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.wordpress.com/2012/05/22/gracious-receiving/\">Gracious Receiving</a></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>For this week I would like everyone to keep a journal again.  This time, write down anything that could possibly be taken as a compliment that you have received from another person during the week.  Notice how at first you are very critical in your assessment of what passes for a compliment.  Try to remember how you respond to the various comments and write that down as well.  Do you change the subject after a compliment?  Do you say &#8220;thank you, I have always noticed that about myself as well&#8221;?  Try to pay attention to your natural response to compliments.  If you are not Receiving Graciously, but are instead down-playing most compliments, or even failing to notice them, then it is time for a change.</p>\n<table width=\"150\" border=\"1\" bgcolor=\"#99ccff\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;\" align=\"center\"><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.wordpress.com/2012/05/11/seeking-help/\">Seeking Help</a></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Don&#8217;t be afraid to ask.

If your Loved one never hears about the bad days, of course they will seem unsupportive and self-absorbed.  But maybe it is less to do with them not caring about you as much as you care about them.  Maybe in our refusal to share our true feelings, we ourselves have created a situation where we feel like we get taken advantage of.</p>\n<p>This week, tell me about your bad days.</p>\n<table width=\"150\" border=\"1\" bgcolor=\"#99ccff\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;\" align=\"center\"><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.wordpress.com/2012/05/23/balanced-expectations/\">Balanced Expectations</a></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>This section of the challenge is all about analyzing our expectations.

Maybe it is time to Balance our expectations in life.  Do you deserve to be treated fairly?  Do you deserve freedom?  Do you deserve affection?  Do you deserve self confidence?  Do you deserve support?  Do you deserve to Receive Love in all of its forms?</p>\n<p>The answer can only be yes.

type.\u00a0 Big and small, swimming and flying, creepy and crawly.\u00a0 I Love them.\u00a0 But mostly I Love raising animals and breeding them.\u00a0 It makes me so happy to plan breeding programs.\u00a0 To match different coloured parents and wait to see what the babies might look like.\u00a0 I am not a fan of purebreds.\u00a0 I Love the mutts.\u00a0 The weirder the colouration the better.\u00a0 When I was in highschool I used to breed Lovebirds and budgies.\u00a0 I remember buying a pair of orange faced Lovebirds and being so excited.\u00a0 This was a very new and rare mutation, and I was one of 4 breeders in Canada with a pair of Orange Faced Lovebirds.\u00a0 And not only that but my birds were carriers for the Olive (dark) gene, as well.\u00a0 This meant that one in four babies would be an olive green\u00a0(double dark) with an orange face, and the other babies would be like mommy and daddy and be carriers of the dark gene with an orange face.\u00a0 I found breeding the lovebirds to be so much fun.\u00a0 I was not very good at it, but I was young and inexperienced.\u00a0 I was only 16 at the time.</p>\n<p>It has been a long time since I have raised any animals.\u00a0 It has always been a passion of mine, so I have decided to rekindle it with a small animal, to start.\u00a0 I know I have spoken about it before, but my exploratory Passion for this Summer will be my Beehive.\u00a0 I am super excited to say that I installed the bees in the hive this morning and it went very well.\u00a0 No stings!\u00a0 They are almost nice&#8230;\u00a0 Here are a few photos to show you how it went!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/dscf32301.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1979\" title=\"DSCF3230\"

pretty tightly attached to the walls of the box at first, and the bees were everywhere.\u00a0 Once I figured out that you could just kind brush them aside and there would be no real reaction, it

width=\"450\"></p>\n<p>In our world today, we are preoccupied with loss.  When we evaluate our lives we do so with regret at the poor decisions we have made and the love we have lost because of it.  For some, this becomes a way of life.  Living in loss has an unfortunate way of perpetuating itself, however.  When we live in loss our expectation is that everything we love will eventually be taken from us.  This causes us to act in one of two ways; both equally destructive.  When we expect the things we love in life to inevitably leave us, we often become detached.  In an attempt to lessen the pain when the thing does finally disappear, we build a wall.  This is the selfish form of this emotion.  It is selfish because we shift our focus inwards and assume that we will eventually be hurt.  In our assumption we create barriers between us and our loved ones.  We never truly allow them in; we never let them to get to know us.  Why would we, they will only leave us anyway?  In so doing, however, we only end up pushing that loved one away.  No matter how hard they try to connect to us, we will not allow it.  We are too selfish to see that they are sincere.  We only see the loss that we will eventually feel when they leave us.  So, try as they might, eventually our loved one will tire of this battle to reach us.  They will give up, and they will leave us.  Just as we had imagined they would.  But they did not leave us because they did not want to love us.  They left us because we are living in loss and refused to allow them in.  Loss creates more loss.</p>\n<p>I mentioned a second negative form of this expression.  Loss is not only expressed by shutting people out.  Loss can also be expressed through an obsessive neediness.  This expression leads to the same thing, however; more loss.  When we live in loss, our expectation is that the things we love most in life will eventually leave us.  When we have this expectation and we find something that we truly feel we cannot live without, we begin to act in a very unhealthy way.  In our attempt to secure our love we go way overboard and instead freak our new love out.  The amount of attention we shower upon them in our attempt to keep them interested only has the effect of pushing them away.  This is the selfish form of our emotions.  It is selfish because we are not taking our loved one&#8217;s feelings into consideration, only our own.  Again our feeling of loss is reinforced.  This time, we have pushed our loved one away by not allowing them the freedom to be themselves.  We force our life upon them, and in the end we lose them.  Loss creates more loss.</p>\n<p>But loss has an equal and opposite expression of emotion.  The spirit of receiving is another way to live our lives.  If we live in the spirit of receiving our expectation is that we will always receive more love.  This is the idea of inheritance.  You receive love because you are somehow deserving of it.  In families this idea flows most easily, although it is not the case in all families.  Some families live in loss and are unable to express this.  But many families know the idea of inherited love.  Love that is not earned but simply given because you are family.  Truly living in the spirit of receiving is understanding that all of humanity is your family.  With this mentality, we give and receive our love freely with all those around us.  When we live in this way, we will find that it also perpetuates itself.  By living in the spirit of receiving, we live in balance.  The spirit of receiving is a position of gratitude.  It does not imply that we only receive.  It implies an understanding that giving and receiving are in equal proportions when dealing with love.  When we are able to balance the giving of love, with the receiving of love, we begin to live in the spirit of receiving.  Notice earlier that the two forms of negatively expressing this emotion are not only imbalances in the receiving aspect, but are also imbalances in the giving aspect.  In the first scenario, we build a wall around ourselves and refuse to give enough love.  When we do not give, we do not receive.  In the second scenario we go over board and love too intensely.  This frightens away most balanced souls and again we find ourselves alone.  Only when we balance our ability to give love freely to everyone are we able to start receiving it from everyone.</p>\n<p>Loss is a wounded emotion.  It is the assumption that we will never receive love in this life.  It is the selfish form of our emotions because it assumes the worst in ourselves; that we are unworthy of love.  When we live in loss we only create loss in our life.  By never allowing anyone healthy into our lives, we eventually find ourselves surrounded with loss.</p>\n<p>The spirit of receiving is a healthy emotion.  It is the assumption that we deserve to be loved and that love will come naturally, so long as we love in return.  In this form we express gratitude.  We are grateful for the love we receive and we reciprocate to those around us.  This in turn generates gratitude in those we love and they feel compelled to share their love with us.  Gratitude perpetuates the receiving of love.  When we live our life in balance, we are living our life with healthy emotions.  Receiving love is as simple as giving it.  But we must give it equally to all, not all of it to one person.  When we share our love equally with everyone in our lives, we begin to notice that we are receiving love from everyone in our lives.  Love perpetuates love, through the act of balanced receiving.</p>\n<p>Read Next:</p>\n<table width=\"250\" border=\"1\" bgcolor=\"#99ccff\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://alternate-economy.com/wordpress/blog/2012/01/03/joy/\">Joy</a>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.alternate-economy.com\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.alternate-economy.com/Images/banner-alternate-economy.jpg\" alt=\"The Alternate Economy\" width=\"450\"></a></p>\n", "post_id": 1995, "location": false, "date": "05-08-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["emotion", "alternate", "love", "cancer", "give", "age of aquarius", "gemini", "thanks", "selfishness", "alternative", "hate", "fear", "film", "astrology", "gratitude", "selfish", "story", "inheritance", "peace", "writing", "passion", "happiness", "remorse", "receiving", "hope", "economy", "compassion", "joy", "aquarius", "judgement", "protection", "security", "loss", "receive", "freedom", "foolishness", "movies", "universe", "hatred", "balance", "greed", "generosity"], "text": "<p>As part of her prize, I Stop for Suffering has shared this post with us.

Because those \u201cFour words that encapsulate for me the whole of Buddhist psychology, philosophy and spiritualism as I have come to realize it. \u201c</p>\n<p>This really sums up my practice for me also.</p>\n<p><strong>What we do matters</strong></p>\n<p><em>What we say</em></p>\n<p><em>What we think</em></p>\n<p><em>The person that we are in this world</em></p>\n<p>I\u2019ve seen a few posts lately on why (and how) people came to be Buddhists.</p>\n<p>For me, it was not a sudden decision that I made. It was born of divine luck.</p>\n<p>About 5 years ago a close friend at the time was feeling very stressed and wanted to attend meditation classes at a local temple. She asked me if I would go with her.</p>\n<p>I had done meditation in the past, as part of a yoga class that I took. I remember the first time that I meditated (in the class). It changed my world. Literally. I felt a peace and centredness that I had never before experienced. As a highly anxious and \u2018nervy\u2019 person it was not a state that was common to me.</p>\n<p>So I excitedly agreed to join my friend in the meditation class. As part of the class, we also had a \u201cIntroduction to Buddhism\u201d class that followed.</p>\n<p>Prior to then I knew nothing about it. Literally nothing. I had no understanding, no thoughts and no misconceptions.</p>\n<p>The class itself, and the way it was presented, was mildly interesting.</p>\n<p>However it sparked something deep within me. I knew that this was my path.</p>\n<p>I always had a very strong desire to be a good person. To be kind to other people. A respect for all forms of life. And Buddhism was the perfect fit for me. The more I read \u2013 and I read A LOT \u2013 the more I knew that it was the path for me.</p>\n<p>It was not accepted in my family though.</p>\n<p>We had a very \u201cnon-religious\u201d upbringing. We actually didn\u2019t have a religion as such.</p>\n<p>I remember telling my parents \u2013 eventually. My father\u2019s reaction \u201cIt\u2019s a cult!\u201d. My mother\u2019s \u201cIt\u2019s a fad, she\u2019ll snap out of it\u201d.</p>\n<p>And of course it was neither.</p>\n<p>So I kept my faith and practice to myself. I quietly read, and learned, and deepened my practice.</p>\n<p>That was 5 years ago.</p>\n<p>Then 12 months ago my world fell apart. My husband left. My son was diagnosed with Aspergers Syndrome. I lost my house. I had a serious car accident (head on collision into a tree), and I wrote off my car.</p>\n<p>Amongst other things.</p>\n<p>I wouldn\u2019t change any of this for the world though \u2013 it\u2019s made me the person I am today.</p>\n<p>I experienced true pain and suffering, and now I know empathy and love.</p>\n<p>For me it was also a time of great realisation \u2013 and the greatest one was that when everything fell apart, all that was left was my son and I.</p>\n<p>There was literally no one I could turn to.</p>\n<p>And I realised that was because most of my relationships and friendships \u2013 even my connection to my family \u2013 was superficial.</p>\n<p>I didn\u2019t put the time or effort into these relationships that I should have, and that they deserved.</p>\n<p>I have turned that around.</p>\n<p>But more importantly I realised \u2013 I want to be there for other people.</p>\n<p>I want to help them and ease their pain. To be there for them when they are suffering and need help. To be the port in the storm, providing calm and shelter.</p>\n<p>So with these intentions in mind, I continue my practice.</p>\n<p>I proudly follow the 5 precepts:</p>\n<p><em>\u201cDo not kill.\u201d</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cDo not steal.\u201d</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cDo not engage in improper sexual conduct.\u201d</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cDo not make false statements.\u201d</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cDo not drink alcohol.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>I also follow the Eightfold Path:</p>\n<p><em>Right View</em></p>\n<p><em>Right Intention</em></p>\n<p><em>Right Speech</em></p>\n<p><em>Right Action</em></p>\n<p><em>Right Livelihood</em></p>\n<p><em>Right Effort</em></p>\n<p><em>Right Mindfulness</em></p>\n<p><em>Right Concentration</em></p>\n<p>Although this is not to say that I don\u2019t make mistakes. But I try to learn from them.</p>\n<p>And so I walk along the path\u2026.</p>\n<p>Humbled and grateful for the opportunity to do so.</p>\n", "post_id": 1998, "location": false, "date": "05-08-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["emotion", "alternate", "love", "cancer", "give", "age of aquarius", "universal", "gemini", "selfishness", "alternative", "hate", "fear", "happiness", "astrology", "gratitude", "selfish", "inheritance", "god", "peace", "religion", "passion", "holy night", "greatness", "remorse", "hope", "economy", "holy", "compassion", "joy", "aquarius", "judgement", "protection", "imagine", "security", "loss", "receive", "science", "foolishness", "generosity", "truth", "universe", "hatred", "balance", "greed"], "text": "<p>This is me singing Oh Holy Night.\u00a0 I changed one or two words.\u00a0 See if you can spot them.</p>\n<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='420' height='315' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/oEuC42TSNho?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span>\n<p>All my love,</p>\n<p>Tristan</p>\n", "post_id": 200, "location": false, "date": "12-24-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["emotion", "love", "family", "Lesley", "thanks", "sustainableutopia", "happiness", "Lesley Pelletier", "Life", "alternate", "passion", "les1lesley", "greatness", "8", "hope", "week", "gratitude", "compassion", "joy", "photography", "passions", "sustainability", "honest passion", "Passionate", "8 Week Challenge", "receive", "challenge", "honest", "generosity", "utopia", "sustainable", "security", "balance", "honest passions"], "text": "<p><strong>Exploratory Passion</strong></p>\n<p>So, as you know, I\u2019m all about the crafts. So, when I read the Exploratory Challenge, my creative gears immediately started turning. What craft hadn\u2019t I tried that I\u2019d always wanted to? Well, to be honest, loads of things came to my mind. I had some criteria, though, which helped me narrow it down. It had to be cheap, it had to be easy to get the tools for, and it had to create something useable or decorative in the end. There, of course, are many options out there that would work, but I settled on learning how to burn wood. No, not just build a fire, but use a wood burning \u201cpen\u201d and create pretty pictures. It followed all my rules, so seemed the perfect choice. It was cheap, the pen was only ten bucks, it was easy to find (Hello Walmart), and it definitely would have an end product that could (potentially) be displayable.<br />\nSo, I got right down to it. I picked out some practice wood, sketched out rough outlines and started burning. It was\u2026 cool. Actually, as it turns out, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something I can get Passionate about. I know, this challenge is supposed to be about finding a new passion, but you know what? Sometimes you\u2019re going to get a bunch of duds before you find something\u00a0 you can really throw yourself into. It\u2019s not like I didn\u2019t enjoy the wood burning. I did. I\u2019ll probably do it again. It\u2019s just that\u2026 well, it was <em>too easy. </em>It\u2019s really just like drawing. It didn\u2019t challenge me at all, I could just sort <em>do</em> it, without much effort.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://sustainableutopia.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/dsc00431.jpg\"><img title=\"SONY DSC\" src=\"https://sustainableutopia.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/dsc00431.jpg?w=411&amp;h=614\" alt=\"\" width=\"411\" height=\"614\" /></a></p>\n<p>First Attempt</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://sustainableutopia.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/dsc00433.jpg\"><img title=\"SONY DSC\" src=\"https://sustainableutopia.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/dsc00433.jpg?w=411&amp;h=614\" alt=\"\" width=\"411\" height=\"614\" /></a></p>\n<p>Second Attempt</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://sustainableutopia.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/dsc00437.jpg\"><img title=\"SONY DSC\" src=\"https://sustainableutopia.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/dsc00437.jpg?w=614&amp;h=411\" alt=\"\" width=\"614\" height=\"411\" /></a></p>\n<p>Third Attempt</p>\n<p>Yeah, I know, there\u2019s room for improvement, for sure, I just don\u2019t think I\u2019m all that interested in improving.

I don\u2019t really have a lot to write about on the subject just now, because I haven\u2019t really started yet. My husband wants to help me with my Photography business (because I\u2019m doing oh so well on my own lol), and I thought it would be fun if he knew his way around a camera. For father\u2019s day this year, I\u2019m going to find him a DSLR of his own and teach him the ins and outs of my Passion. If he learns to Love it as much as I do, it will open up a whole new world of possibilities for us for everything from vacations to careers. It\u2019s going to be a very exciting new era for us. Stay tuned, I\u2019ll update you as the lessons progress.</p>\n<p>I hope you guys enjoyed learning about Passion this week, and would Love it if you would join us in the 8 Week Challenge. Next up with be learning to have a Spirit of Receiving (something I\u2019ve always struggled with, so this week should be particularly helpful for me), but you can always go back to the beginning and start whenever you\u2019d like. I can\u2019t tell you how this Challenge is changing my life on a daily basis. I\u2019m seeing things differently than I ever have before, and I\u2019m becoming a better person for it.

As you may have gleaned from my posts up to this point, I have a <em>lot</em> of hobbies, and I\u2019m passionate about every single one of them. I love crafts, pretty much all of them.\u00a0 I\u2019m also really into survivalism and learning primitive skills (think fire with sticks and flint knapping, baby, I\u2019m all over that stuff). I\u2019m also pretty Passionate about the people I Love. The problem is, I don\u2019t like being needlessly cruel, so I didn\u2019t want to write out a big list of cons about anyone I Love. Sure, their faults only make me Love them more, but I don\u2019t really think it\u2019s appropriate to spell them out for all the world to see. So what I finally settled on was my photography. There is so much I Love about photography. I Love to capture moments. Not just someone posing, but getting those candid\u00a0 shots of people just living. I Love taking a picture, giving it to someone and having them smile, not just because of the picture, but because of the memory it represents for them. I Love the solitude the camera brings. Even in a crowded room, surrounded by people, it\u2019s just me and my camera. I can slink through the swarm, casually snapping pictures as I go, and no one will bother me. Alternatively, I Love how it draws people in. It doesn\u2019t matter where I am, whenever I pull out my camera with the big, professional looking lenses, there will be without fail at least one person who is curious about it. Just the other day I was at the zoo with my family and was approached by someone asking about how well the camera worked, and what brand I used and if it really made it seem like the bars weren\u2019t there. I don\u2019t mind at all. I Love photography, and I\u2019m always happy to chat with someone about my passion.</p>\n<p>Don\u2019t think it\u2019s all a magical Love affair though. My relationship with Photography is definitely Love/Hate. One thing I should say is that I do this professionally. Not all the time, not even for a lot of money, but I do consider this to be my career, and am hoping that once my kids are older I can put enough focus on this to really make a go of it. The problem is, I don\u2019t know the first thing about running a business. That\u2019s not really the problem, anyone can learn how to run a business. The problem is, I don\u2019t <em>want</em> to learn how to run a business. I hate numbers, I\u2019m not good at networking, I don\u2019t like advertising and I\u2019m horrible about negotiating prices with people. I do this because I Love it, and I think everyone should have beautiful pictures to put on their wall. I can say with certainty that I\u2019ve been taken advantage of in the money department. People want the best bang for their buck, and if they\u2019re able to trick some dupe into negotiating away any possible profit, they\u2019re going to. And because I\u2019m not really doing this for the money, I let them. I\u2019m learning though. I did a 12 hour wedding, with another 15-20 hours of editing after the fact for only $200 bucks last year, and have definitely started to have a better respect for not only what I do, but my time doing it. I\u2019m good at what I do, and I deserve to be treated like a professional. So, even though I\u2019m not fond of the business aspect of running a Photography business, it\u2019s making me appreciate my skills in a whole new light, aprofitable light.</p>\n<p>Another downside of Photography is that it requires patience, which is not something I\u2019ve always been good at. I really Love doing nature photography, but nature is far from predictable, and not always very accommodating. You can sit in the woods for days with your finger on the trigger, so to speak, and never get a shot of a deer. Then of course, you can go out on a hike without your camera the next week and see three. It\u2019s incredibly frustrating waiting for nature to comply. The nature photos, of course, are not what pay the bills. For that, I do a lot of family portraits. I Love this. It gets me interacting with lots of people and interacting with some of my favourite people; children. The problem with children, though, is that they\u2019re a lot like animals. They don\u2019t really like to cooperate. For ever picture that turns out like this:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://sustainableutopia.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/t001.jpg\"><img title=\"SONY DSC\" src=\"https://sustainableutopia.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/t001.jpg?w=296&amp;h=442\" alt=\"\" width=\"296\" height=\"442\" /></a></p>\n<p>You get ten photos that turn out like this:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://sustainableutopia.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/dsc00105.jpg\"><img title=\"Fuzzy\" src=\"https://sustainableutopia.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/dsc00105.jpg?w=296&amp;h=442\" alt=\"\" width=\"296\" height=\"442\" /></a></p>\n<p>But it\u2019s those ten bad shots that make the good one so spectacular. It\u2019s so gratifying to see the parents gush over the adorable moments I\u2019ve captured for them. So, even though it was an hour of wrangling a hyper/cranky/show-off/pouty/mean/mouthy/hungry/crying child, it was totally worth it for that one shot that perfectly captures their perfect angel. It\u2019s those perfect shots that keep me coming back, even after all the frustration, when business is bad, when I don\u2019t want to deal with clients, when nature just isn\u2019t cooperating. No matter how crappy a session is going, there will always be that Perfect Shot to look forward to, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m Passionate about Photography.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.wordpress.com/2012/04/07/the-8-week-challenge/\"><img title=\"week\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/badge.jpg?w=108&amp;h=300&amp;h=108\" alt=\"\" width=\"108\" height=\"108\" /></a></em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Author: Lesley Pelletier of <a href=\"http://sustainableutopia.wordpress.com/\">SustainableUtopia</a></p>\n", "post_id": 2007, "location": false, "date": "05-08-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["emotion", "alternate", "love", "cancer", "give", "age of aquarius", "gemini", "thanks", "selfishness", "alternative", "hate", "fear", "film", "astrology", "gratitude", "selfish", "story", "inheritance", "peace", "writing", "passion", "happiness", "remorse", "receiving", "hope", "economy", "compassion", "joy", "aquarius", "judgement", "protection", "security", "loss", "receive", "freedom", "foolishness", "movies", "universe", "hatred", "balance", "greed", "generosity"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/meditation.jpg\"><img src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/meditation.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" alt=\"\" title=\"lake yoga\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2032\" /></a></p>\n<p>For my example of Honest Passion, I will be attempting to discuss my greatest passion.  But first I must identify my greatest passion.  I am getting the impression that some of you are having a hard time identifying what it is your <em>greatest</em> passion might be.  There is really only one way to find out what it is&#8230; work it out with a pencil.</p>\n<p>So, here is my piece on Honest Passion.</p>\n<p>I am incredibly passionate about several things.  I Love to problem solve.  It is what I do best, in my opinion.  Give me a problem and I <em>will</em> find the answer.  I always do.  But when it comes to problem solving, what gets me the most excited is tackling a problem that has been deemed by society to be &#8220;unsolvable&#8221;.  By introducing Balance and Awareness into my assessment of a problem, I am coming to learn that no problem is unsolvable.  Not one.  There is a solution to any problem this Earth has to offer me.  And the solution is almost always somewhere in the middle.  I am passionate about finding Balance in a situation.</p>\n<p>I am also incredibly passionate about sharing my Love with others.  I Love to Love.  It is what I do best, in my opinion.  Give me a wounded soul, a broken heart, or a tattered self image and I will kiss your wounds, mend your heart and piece together your confidence.  If I am truly honest with myself, the more wounded the better.  This is not the greatest habit on my part, because I am learning that the more wounded someone is the less likely they are to allow me to help them.  But I cannot help myself.  Looking at my track record, the four women I Loved the most in this life were a 16 year old mother, a girl living half way across the world who cheated on me repeatedly, a woman incapable of having sexual intercourse and a hopeless drug addict.  These are not judgments.  I forgave them all and dated them for over a year.  But in the end, they all left me.  I am not great at choosing Lovers&#8230;  But I Love to Love.  I Love to see someone turn from gloomy to smiles all because of me.  And I am good at getting those smiles at first.  But then it all starts to become a bit too much for my Lover.  It all starts to become a bit too much for me too.  I am only truly learning about who I am in the last 8 months.  And I am pretty wounded myself.  But if I am honest with myself then I must admit I am passionate about fixing people.  I just want to make everything better.</p>\n<p>And that is what it all boils down to.  I just want to fix things.  Share myself.  Be the light in someone&#8217;s life.  I am most happy when I know that those around me are also happy.  I am most passionate about Living in Love.  It is my greatest passion.  Living in Love is all that I ever think about.  It is all that matters to me.  When I lie awake at night, I think of ways to fix our economy and introduce equality.  When I drive to work I think about how best to include a loving interaction from recently into my blog.  I want to share.  I want you to see how easy it is. </p>\n<p>But if we are really being honest, I am selfish.  I do not so much want to change the conditions of this miserable world for everyone else.  I do want it for everyone else.  But mostly I want it for me.  I want a world where I am allowed to Live in Love.  I want my neighbours to Live in Love too.  I want you to Live in Love, and your partner, and your friends.  I am tired of fighting.  Tired of the pain.  It is all so unnecessary.</p>\n<p>My honest passion is that I want to change the world, because I know it can be done, and I no longer want to live in a world where I am lonely while Living in Love.</p>\n<p>I want to share my Love with everyone, even the most wounded, because I know you are all capable of what I have.  We are all capable of Love.  I will be the proof.  I will Live in Love.  And before long, I will change the world.</p>\n", "post_id": 2028, "location": false, "date": "05-09-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["emotion", "love", "family", "Lesley", "thanks", "sustainableutopia", "happiness", "Lesley Pelletier", "Life", "alternate", "passion", "les1lesley", "greatness", "8", "hope", "2012", "week", "gratitude", "compassion", "joy", "photography", "passions", "sustainability", "honest passion", "Passionate", "8 Week Challenge", "receive", "challenge", "honest", "generosity", "utopia", "sustainable", "security", "balance", "honest passions"], "text": "<div class=\"wpcom-reblog-snapshot\"><div class=\"reblogger-note\"><p class=\"reblogger-headline\"><img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e2f51c0cd14ea6476e6899f53e2856c6?s=32&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-32' height='32' width='32' /><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.wordpress.com/author/alternateeconomy/\">The Alternate Economy</a>:</p><div class='reblogger-note-content'><blockquote><p>Another post I wrote for my brother&#8217;s Blog!</p>\n</blockquote></div></div><div class=\"reblog-post\"><p class=\"reblog-from\"><img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/554a3611d81ee81240fed36dad86b111?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />Originally posted on <a href=\"http://filmphanatic.wordpress.com/2012/05/05/films-to-see-before-you-die-50-avatar/\">filmphanatic</a>:</p><div class=\"reblogged-content\">\n<p><img src=\"http://images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/2010724//425.avatar.lr.082410.jpg\" width=\"300\" alt=\"avatar\"></p>\n\n<p><em>I have invited my Brother to write another post on my bloggy.\u00a0 This is a movie that is quite close to his heart.\u00a0 For more posts of\u00a0 his, check out his blog at the <a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.wordpress.com\">Alternate Economy</a>.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Avatar (2009)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Director: James Cameron</p>\n\n<p>Cast: Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Steven Lang, Sigourney Weaver</p>\n\n<p>Synopsis: We quickly find ourselves in a vibrant futuristic world following the life of a paraplegic ex-marine, Jake Sully (Sam Worthington).\u00a0 He immediately finds himself entered into the Avatar program and is shipped off to outer space.\u00a0 The destination; Pandora, a fertile and fully inhabited moon in another solar system.\u00a0 When Jake arrives he is debriefed by Col.

And also about not quite trusting </a><em><a title=\"My post, 'Passion, intertwining'\" href=\"http://wp.me/p1zocx-jw\">passion</a>.</em>\u00a0I&#8217;m realizing that my initial response to this topic, Passion, is being colored\u00a0by something that happens to me from time to time: I get too literal, I analyze t0o minutely, I lose my sense of humor. And what I further realize about <em>that</em> is <em>this</em>: It&#8217;s a response to <a title=\"My post, 'Lurking, lurking ......'\" href=\"http://wp.me/p1zpcx-1pJ\">fear, something I&#8217;ve also written about before</a>, a topic of much past &amp; future exploration. Though I&#8217;ve not written much about Week 4 of the<a href=\"http://mindmindful.wordpress.com\">\u00a08 Week Challenge, it&#8217;s been percolating for all this time.</a></p>\n<p>What is relevant here about these revelations (jeez! see what i mean?!?) is that a very real passion of mine is being &#8230;&#8230; revealed (good goddess almighty!!): <em>I love seeing clearly. And I love blogging about it.</em> And &#8212; not incidentally, &amp; not coincidentally &#8212; <em>that is the very point of my blog,\u00a0 </em><a href=\"http://mindmindful.wordpress.com\">MindMindful</a><em>, </em>seeing with clarity, which is &#8220;mindfulness&#8221;. So, here, making me laugh, &amp; lifting some of the fear,<em> I am doing something I am really becoming passionate about: blogging. </em>I find myself talking about &#8220;my blog&#8221;, &#8220;my blogging fr<a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/untitled.png\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-2040\" title=\"Cat wrangling\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/untitled.png?w=275&#038;h=183\" alt=\"\" width=\"275\" height=\"183\" /></a>iends&#8221;, &#8220;blogs that are about &#8230;..&#8221;, trying to get others interested in reading blogs, &amp; writing their own. I hope I&#8217;m not being annoying! I hope people will find something that helps them in some way through blogging. Is there a career in being a blogging ambassador??</p>\n<p>So, the honest assessment of this passion of mine includes: The &#8216;fors&#8217; &#8212; Connection with others, Wrangling with myself til I see something clearly, The spectacular insights that are sometimes revealed <em>as I write</em>, Expressing things within myself &amp; my life that may be\u00a0of benefit to others, Time flies by. The &#8216;againsts&#8217; &#8212; Wrangling with myself til I see something clearly, Wrangling with <em>myself</em> til I see something clearly, Wrangling with myself <em>til I see</em> something clearly, Wrangling with myself til I see something <em>clearly.</em></p>\n<p>I<a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/imagescagww3h5.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-2041\" title=\"Superhero Rogue\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/imagescagww3h5.jpg?w=208&#038;h=242\" alt=\"\" width=\"208\" height=\"242\" /></a>\u00a0think all of these are experienced by many writers, maybe all who write. And we all know the sense of triumph we feel when we&#8217;re able to finally express &lt;&gt;; it feels good!! It feels like We Have DONE Something, right?? Haha, well, by golly we have: We have engaged with that most fearsome of beasts, <em>our selves</em>, &amp; corralled it long enough to find some truth, tiny or tumultuous. I know that I am writing so much because blogging software makes it easy to get the thoughts expressed, &amp; stored, &amp; shared. I have made many discoveries through this process, one being that it is nothing less than a very real journey. And\u00a0 I have discovered just how timid I really always have been. Yet, blogging, the whole system &amp; process, &amp; passion of <strong>blogging &#8212; because I am looking so closely at my mind &amp; its doings, &amp; so often, seeing what is really there, helps me to be fearless</strong>. So, <em>honestly</em>?

I try to learn from everything, everyone; even if something seems bad to others, it seems good to me. A simple thought and a little change of perspective has brought a great transformation in me and hence my life. I still remember when I was in high school and I used to ask questions (although I rarely asked subject related questions\u2026..lol) that were never answered; not because they were very difficult to answer, but they were so w<a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/existentialism.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-2047\" title=\"Existentialism\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/existentialism.jpg?w=277&#038;h=275\" alt=\"\" width=\"277\" height=\"275\" /></a>eird to answer (as they said). Since, no one gave importance to my questions, I started ignoring them too; but I couldn\u2019t! They were in my nerves, haunting me every time, distracting me from focusing unless answered. As I got promoted in this educational system, I entered the field of professionalism, ENGINEERING. A field, where everything should be practical, out of books, and created in the real world. But the word \u2018practicality\u2019 was extinct here. So, this brought in more questions\u2026..actually a flood of weird questions! Woah\u2026.the wave was too gigantic to surf on!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">As I entered my 2<sup>nd</sup> year, something from inside, told me to stop wandering on this endless road with no sign boards. Then came a day, when I \u2018compiled\u2019 all my courage, strengthened my will and decided not to follow the same path as others do. I decided to answer all those weird questions myself and in this growing curiosity, I found a solution\u2026.a medium. My curiosity kept telling me to look inside for answers. Soon, I realized that all those questions that I used to ask were not just questions; they were life changing realizations. These questions were somehow connected to \u2018value of life\u2019, \u2018purpose of life\u2019, \u2018reason for existence\u2019, \u2018defining and creating beliefs\u2019 and so on. All this time, I was struggling with something that was priceless, even more valuable than the most valuable thing on this planet (differs from person to person).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">I found a way to adjust myself in this world and my world of curiosity. Then, I found a way to harness inner peace\u2026\u2026.MEDITATION. Meditation made me realize many new things and sorted out many old beliefs. It gave me the opportunity, the energy to relate my realizations and my answers to the questions of this world, even in my subjects. Soon, I found a wonderful and amazing relation between everything that exists. The doubts in my subjects were now the doubts of my conscious. If somehow I can answer my conscious, my problems are solved in this world too. Singularity is what I saw deep within. Everything was related; I just had to find out how!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">What earlier I experienced, was the beginning of a process, a process to realization of my existence in this world. <strong>Existentialism</strong> is what I live in today and I enjoy it more than anything else. \u00a0It all started with a spark of curiosity and today I\u2019m living the happiest moments of my life. I know my purpose of existence, but with every new day, I realize something new and try to relate it with my earlier realizations. It\u2019s like a chain; ending on SELF-AWAKENING, where a person will achieve the knowledge of ultimate truth. Currently, I\u2019m in a process and every step of this process is bringing new excitements, new challenges and new adventures.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Through my experience, I would like to spread the message of awareness. People should be curious about things going around them. Some things demand reason, some things do not. Live your life for a purpose; a purpose not for telling it or showing it to the world, but only YOU. This is the way of life and this is how it is supposed to be, according to my beliefs. Your life depends on your beliefs; live well\u2026..!!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><a title=\"Varun K. Sharma\" href=\"http://varungenius.wordpress.com\">\u00a9Varun K.

They are relatively simple jobs, but they tend to get overlooked when I am busy trying to update the blog.</p>\n<p><strong>1: Twitter Administrator &#8211; Filled</strong></p>\n<p>Thank you <a href=\"http://mindmindful.wordpress.com\">MindMindful</a>!</p>\n<p><del datetime=\"2012-04-24T17:15:53+00:00\">I feel like my twitter account is pretty lame and doesn&#8217;t have many followers. I pretty much only tweet my new posts, so it is no wonder that it doesn&#8217;t have much of a following. Plus, I am not sure how you market twitter effectively. I would Love it if someone would take over the responsibility of posting daily tweets on the topic of Love and trying to promote the Alternate Economy&#8217;s twitter account. If you are interested, let me know in this comment thread.</del></p>\n<p><strong>2: Newsletter Administrator</strong></p>\n<p>I actually do have a newsletter list going, with a decent number of emails on it. I do not currently send out any newsletters, as those who are on the list may have noticed. I find there is just no time to get this organized. I would Love it if someone would take over the responsibility of writing a bi-weekly newsletter, featuring recent award winners, links to various related news articles and updates on the Experimental Farm. If you are interested in composing a bi-weekly newsletter for the Alternate Economy, let me know in this comment thread.</p>\n<p><strong>3: Promoter</strong></p>\n<p>The main goal of the Alternate Economy is spreading the word. The more time I spend at the experimental farm, the less time I have to promote this idea. I need someone who is willing to spend a few hours a week promoting the Alternate Economy by posting links back to this site on various related forums and blogs, etc. by leaving comments. This is NOT a SPAM job, but will require that you join some community sites and engage the members in a way that encourages them to visit our blog. If you are interested in promoting the Alternate Economy, let me know in this comment thread.</p>\n<p><strong>4: Radio Host &#8211; Filled</strong></p>\n<p>Thank you Katrina!</p>\n<p><del datetime=\"2012-05-15T11:54:39+00:00\">I am trying to create an archive of Radio shows that feature Living in Love as their main theme.  This is another project that I just cannot seem to keep on top of.  I would Love it if someone with a outgoing personality was interested in recording a show once every week for the Alternate Economy.  This job will take a bit of a commitment, but you will have an audience of close to 2,000 listeners.</del></p>\n<p>I would like to thank you in advance. I really appreciate the help and I feel that it will only move this idea forward. We can all play a role in promoting the idea of Living in Love. If you feel this cause is worthy, but don&#8217;t know what you can do to help, here are a couple of ideas&#8230;</p>\n", "post_id": 2057, "location": false, "date": "05-11-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>As part of her prize, I Stop for Suffering has shared this post with us.

If we feel Joy, then we are doing well and if we feel the opposite, remorse, then we are not doing so well.  I imagine for many of the people participating in this challenge Joy will be the greatest tease.  It should be the easiest challenge.  But I am willing to bet that many of you find that compassion and generosity come much more instinctively.  When confronted with situations that require compassion, I never seem to fail to act appropriately.  But Joy is slightly different.  It is true that while in public and surrounded by strangers, my instinct is to present Joy.  But when I am alone, or with people I trust, my default position is not always Joy.  In fact it is rarely Joy in those scenarios.</p>\n<p>Why is it that the simplest emotion, Love is Good, is the hardest to remember behind closed doors?  Joy is often confused with happiness, but these two ideas are slightly different.  Happiness requires Joy, but the same cannot be said for Joy.  Joy can exist without happiness, and in fact it most often does.  Joy is more complex than happiness because it arrives from an awareness of one&#8217;s position in life.  Joy is taken from the journey, rather than from the particulars.  When we come to see that our life is an adventure full of ups and downs but with one specific target in mind, the particulars become less important.  The voyage takes primacy.  Joy is found in the moment, when we allow the moment to simple be what it is.  Joy is not so much created, as it is participated in.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/badge.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1497\" title=\"badge\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/badge.jpg?w=300&#038;h=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>This Weeks Challenge</strong></p>\n<p>Most people equate joy with happiness. But let&#8217;s take a look at Happiness, shall we? &#8220;Happy&#8221; comes from the root word &#8220;happen&#8221;. Furthermore, &#8220;Happen&#8221; comes from &#8220;Hap&#8221;, meaning chance or fate. So, one can reasonably conclude that The feeling of &#8220;Happiness&#8221; comes from something happening to a person simply by chance. Joy is completely different. Joy is a source of delight, it&#8217;s what &#8220;happens&#8221; to bring about happiness.</p>\n<p>Joy is often confused with our more fleeting emotions. Joy comes not only from happiness, but from anticipation, excitement, contentment, comfort, affection, pride, satisfaction and wonder. They are all Joyful states of mind, but unlike Joy, none are permanent. Joy is the path we take to arrive at these emotional destinations. Where happiness is a destination, Joy is the journey. We must not get too caught up in the destination, when the journey alone is something to rejoice in.</p>\n<p>The following examples are suggestions only. Feel free to incorporate as many of them into your daily life as you are able to, or create your own examples of Joy.</p>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:awards@alternate-economy.com\">Send Entries to awards@alternate-economy.com</a></p>\n<p>The following challenge is split into three categories. Please complete each category and send an email with an essay describing how your week of Living in Joy has changed you. This essay can be anywhere from 500 to 1000 words and will become a post on this blog.</p>\n<table width=\"150\" border=\"1\" bgcolor=\"#99ccff\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;\" align=\"center\">Joyful Excitement</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The most common form associated with true Joy, Joyful excitement is essentially &#8220;happiness&#8221;.  It is Joy that arises from the act of having fun.  When we pursue activities that bring us a thrill we will find that we cannot help but be Joyful.  This form of Joy is easily spread to others as well.  By including others in our moments of excitement we can also help them to feel our Joy.  Joy can be as infectious as any of the other emotions and times of excitement are often the times when we share Joy most freely.</p>\n<p>For this week, try to engage in as many activities that you know bring you Joy as possible.  Invite your friends and loved ones to join you as well.  Joyful Excitement is created by going out there and grabbing life by the horns.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Go for a hike somewhere in Nature that you have never been before.  Turn it into an adventure by packing a lunch and bringing your camera along.<br />\n\u2022 Take a day off and visit a water park or amusement park.  Go on rides, eat cotton candy.  BE a kid for a day.<br />\n\u2022 Rent your favourite movie and have some friends over.  Make a fun party snack that you Love and share it with everyone there.</p>\n<table width=\"150\" border=\"1\" bgcolor=\"#99ccff\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;\" align=\"center\">Joyful Anticipation</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>This next category that we will investigate this week is one which I believe is very important to fostering a permanent sense of Joy in our lives.  Joy comes from many things, but one of the greatest sources of Joy is the ability to recognize happy events in the future and look forward to them with true anticipation and Joy.  This is not quite the same as Hope, because in Hope we create Love by moving towards our goals with positive actions.  In Joy we simply move through life with a pleasant spirit and a positive mind frame, enjoying every bump along the way.  There is less creation and more participation in Joy.  Joyful anticipation arrives when we see the good in waiting for things.</p>\n<p>There are many experiences in life that can bring us remorse or sorrow if we look at them through tinted glasses.  A lover leaving on a trip for three weeks could be a sad event.  Or it could be a Joyful one.  It all depends on how you view it.  If you are able to keep Joyful anticipation in mind, even when we are forced to separate from our Loved ones, we can still see the Joy in our separation.</p>\n<p>For this week, try to think of something that you know will be coming to you in the future.  Try to rationalize to yourself why it is better to wait.  Come to understand that the waiting is what makes the event so special and plan on greeting the wait with Joy.</p>\n<table width=\"150\" border=\"1\" bgcolor=\"#99ccff\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;\" align=\"center\">Joyful Contentment</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Another label for this category could have just been &#8220;At Ease&#8221;.  When we find joyful contentment, we arrive at a position of satisfaction.  We are at ease with our positioning in life and satisfied with our contributions.  We are grateful for what we have and aware of both the positive and negative influences in our lives.  But even the negative influences bring a smile to our face.  Because we understand that without them we would have no reference point.  Life would become boring and Joy would seem mundane.  Joy arrives when we accept that life is not always perfect, but that is what makes it so amazing!</p>\n<p>For this week, try to visualize the path that has brought you to where you are today.  It will be full of positive memories and negative ones.  Please, write about how the person you are today could only have existed with both stories in your past.  The positive stories shape our expectations, but the negative stories shape our reference point.  They allow us to understand compassion and generosity and the more complex emotions.  And they lead us to new and interesting perspectives.  Joyful contentment comes from recognizing your past and greeting it with a smile.</p>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:awards@alternate-economy.com\">Send Entries to awards@alternate-economy.com</a></p>\n", "post_id": 2079, "location": false, "date": "05-14-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Wiccan", "Space-time", "Buddhist", "Dharma", "MindMindful", "Karma", "8 Week Challenge"], "text": "<p><strong>Balanced</strong> <strong>expectations</strong>\u00a0\u00a0 This section really will be <em>an analysis of what I believe.</em> Many changes have come about since I&#8217;ve begun to seriously &amp; diligently &#8220;work&#8221; the <a title=\"Buddhism\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">Buddhist</a> dharma teachings. This is the whole point of them: The world isn&#8217;t made different; <em>the practitioner is</em>.

Ripples &#8230;&#8230;. Because of these changes within me, I have to re-examine everything &#8212;&gt;&gt; So, beliefs about expectations that I&#8217;ve held in the past, well, I guess I&#8217;m unsure of just what they are now &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.</p>\n<p>When my world view was predominantly <a title=\"Wicca\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicca\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">Wiccan</a>, I believed wholeheartedly in the idea that what you send out returns to you three times (or ten, there&#8217;s some variation here). I don&#8217;t really DISbelieve that, now &#8212; the gift within this teaching is to make people very conscious of what they do &amp; don&#8217;t do, how they think &amp; don&#8217;t think. This is a good thing! But I still always have been more convinced that &#8216;what we get from life&#8217; has much more to do with the <a title=\"Karma\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">karmic</a> burdens we&#8217;ve constructed. That is, we have to live out the consequences of our thoughts &amp; actions, in this life, &amp; eons of others. It&#8217;s entirely self-created, so it&#8217;s not a means of avoiding responsibility at all &#8212;&gt;&gt; <em>&#8220;I did &lt;&lt;whatever&gt;&gt;, so its natural consequences will come around, &amp; I have to play them out.&#8221;</em>\u00a0The main reason I moved to having a guru, Amma, &amp; working the dharma teachings is to learn to avoid creating karma (&#8220;bad&#8221;) to make fewer natural consequences that are troublesome for my future, &amp; for the world as a whole. Buddhism offers you the opportunities to learn how to make those changes within yourself, the ones that will help you avoid re-creating the troubles you&#8217;ve had in this life &#8212; this is the &#8216;suffering&#8217; the Buddha was teaching about, the natural consequences of your own actions, &amp; your responses to them, &amp; what <em>that</em> creates in turn.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/imagescaivucvr.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-2113\" title=\"Fabric of space-time   www.blog.world-mysteries.com\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/imagescaivucvr.jpg?w=240&#038;h=205\" alt=\"\" width=\"240\" height=\"205\" /></a>Like I said, this examination of my beliefs &amp; ideas re expectations (&amp; many other things too!) will undoubtedly continue, which is part of what my blog is about. There&#8217;s so much that we absorb from our family of origin, schooling, culture that we mostly don&#8217;t ever really look at. All those presumptions sit quietly within our psyches, guiding us, leading us. And until we begin to minutely examine those for some reason, we may never be aware that <strong>&#8220;the way it is&#8221; doesn&#8217;t necessarily have to &#8220;be the way it is&#8221;.</strong>\u00a0Hmmmm &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.</p>\n<p>Jeez, re-reading those previous paragraphs makes me see what I DO believe re expectations: I believe that</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em><strong>when I change myself &#8220;for the better&#8221;, I bring about some alteration in the fabric of space-time through which I live &amp; move</strong>.</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em>Ergo, I re-create the future.</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em>Hmmmmmm &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.</em></p>\n", "post_id": 2098, "location": false, "date": "05-15-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Synergy", "Dharma", "MindMindful", "Karma", "The Buddha", "receiving", "8 Week Challenge"], "text": "<p>The <a title=\"8 Week Challenge\" href=\"http://wp.me/p21f5h-o8\">8 Week Challenge </a>is pushing me to examine some things in my own blog, <a href=\"http://mindmindful.wordpress.com\">MindMindful</a>, &amp; for that I am grateful, as uncomfortable as some of it is.

In the meantime, I&#8217;m moving on to finish up Week 5 because I am really looking forward to this next week&#8217;s topic of Joy.</p>\n<p><strong>Gracious receiving\u00a0\u00a0 </strong>Personally, I don&#8217;t have much trouble in receiving a compliment, or a gift, or even help from someone else. What I have trouble with is in craving acknowledgement, or in feeling bereft of the &#8220;goodies&#8221;. I am a very nice person, &amp; I do some wonderful, interesting, creative, life-enhancing things, &amp; I love being helpful &#8212; why shouldn&#8217;t I be complimented? In return, I hand out compliments willy nilly myself &#8212; they cost nothing, &amp; can go a long way toward helping someone else feel joy in living. Graciousness is a big thing for me, &amp; &#8212; as I write this I am realizing something &#8211;<a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/untitled1.png\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-2102\" title=\"Offering   www.buddhachicklife.com\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/untitled1.png?w=200&#038;h=200\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" /></a> <em><strong>I wish the world would be kinder, more gracious, nicer. So, I&#8217;ve become pretty gracious &amp; kind myself</strong> </em>&#8230;.. hmmm. That &#8220;being the change you want to see&#8221; &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. I&#8217;ve never looked at this aspect of myself in this way before. <em>Good Goddess Almighty! I love this blogging stuff!!</em></p>\n<p>So, I&#8217;ve learned to accept it with equanimity, when someone offers me that gift of recognition &#8212; because my insecure little self, way down deep, craves being seen as the <del>good girl</del> the <em>worthy woman</em>\u00a0I really am. And &#8212; I say this only 3/4 joking: It trains people in learning to see the good stuff in others, recognize it, &amp; say something about it. Nice little circle, ya? Plus, I make a big effort, nearly constantly, to look for &amp; mention the good stuff of others, even strangers &#8212; I mean, I love it, so I like to give it forward too. Now, this doesn&#8217;t mean that that insecure part of me always quite <em>believes</em>\u00a0I deserve such gracious recognition. And sometimes, I frankly am wary of a compliment being used as an attempt to manipulate me; but this is my junk, not the others person&#8217;s (usually). Here&#8217;s the truth of it: I do deserve to be recognized &amp; acknowledged for all my fine qualities &#8212; &amp; so do YOU! So, here&#8217;s one for you:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I very much appreciate that you take the time out of your life to give a little attention to what I say through blogging. It is a gift to me that my thoughts put into words are of interest to others, &amp; maybe are even helpful in some way. Thank YOU for this:) (((You obviously are a deeply intelligent &amp; highly interesting person:):):)</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Seeking help</strong>\u00a0\u00a0 I learned to begin asking for help, of a practical kind, when I had my kid. I was single, her father was only kind of involved, &amp; I quickly realized that the mountain of custodial care an infant requires left not-enough time for everything else. At that time, I had a good circle of friends, all of whom were child-oriented folks, so they were all willing to help out. And, I with them. The &#8220;village&#8221; works, in raising kids.</p>\n<p>The kind of help that <em>is</em>\u00a0difficult for me is when I am ego-involved in the outcome of something. A very prevalent part of the American mythos is &#8220;the lone wolf&#8221;, the pioneer. The one who doesn&#8217;t need anyone else. (Which is all crap, really &#8212; more homesteads had a barn or quilts or crops, more quickly, when others came over to help bring them about.) But, I was steeped in this mythology just like the rest of us, &amp; part of me feels I can do, &amp; <em>should</em> do everything, all by myself. My wishful self wants to believe that no one <em>needs</em> anyone else. But my wiser self knows that when folks come together for tasks small or large, grand or mundane, practical or abstract, <em>&amp; work companionably &amp; respectfully</em>\u00a0together, greater things can be\u00a0done. And they can be done with more fun along the way &amp; maybe more quickly, so we can all get to the celebratory party afterwards:)<a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/imagesca8cgh0a.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-2103\" title=\"Synergy   www.infusezeal.com\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/imagesca8cgh0a.jpg?w=225&#038;h=224\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"224\" /></a></p>\n<p>I highly value <em>helpfulness </em>&amp; it is one of my favorite things about myself. And a friend from a long time ago taught me a wise lesson in helping me to see that <em><strong>it undervalues others to refuse to let them help you</strong></em>. Where this gets turned on its head in ShalaWorld\u00a0is when I forget that I do not have every ability, &amp; every skill. And when I undervalue those that I do have. BUT, I realize from the depths of my heart, &amp; from the furthest reaches of my mind, that I have valuable things to contribute, of many kinds, &amp; that&#8221;I&#8221;, my full self, is better, more far-reaching, &amp; groovier when I am a part of a group working toward a common goal.</p>\n<p>My &#8220;bad days&#8221;, as Tristan invites, come when I forget all of this, when I try to conform to that idea of not needing anyone. It is the sense of being connected to others around me, &amp; of contributing (with, hopefully, recognition, acknowledgement &amp; some compliements too:) to the common well-being that dissolves them. This might take the practical form of mowing my dad&#8217;s yard. Or, the abstract form of sending loving-kindness to others. So, I think what I mean is this: any bad days, or moments, I have come when I buy into the delusion that I Am An Island in the sea of humanity, separate from others, not needing them &amp; not being necessary to them also. When I come back to my senses, I remember that the tiniest thing, such as my smile, can alter someone else&#8217;s whole day. The &#8220;bad moment&#8221; then becomes an opportunity to see where I am blocking the connection that we all innately have with each other, which is where compassion is born. And <em>compassion is nothing more or less than the ultimate form of synergy</em>, &lt;&lt;me&gt;&gt; &amp; &lt;&lt;you&gt;&gt; being &lt;&lt;we&gt;&gt;.</p>\n<h6>Related articles</h6>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.wordpress.com/2012/05/07/week-5-receiving/\" target=\"_blank\">Week 5: Receiving</a> (alternateeconomy.wordpress.com)</li>\n</ul>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.wordpress.com/2012/04/24/week-2-compassion-forgiveness-dialogue-we-be-lotus/\" target=\"_blank\">Week 2: Compassion, Forgiveness Dialogue &#8211; We be Lotus</a> (alternateeconomy.wordpress.com)</li>\n</ul>\n", "post_id": 2099, "location": false, "date": "05-14-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["emotion", "alternate", "love", "cancer", "give", "age of aquarius", "gemini", "thanks", "selfishness", "alternative", "hate", "fear", "film", "astrology", "gratitude", "selfish", "story", "inheritance", "peace", "writing", "passion", "happiness", "remorse", "receiving", "hope", "economy", "compassion", "joy", "aquarius", "judgement", "protection", "security", "loss", "receive", "freedom", "foolishness", "movies", "universe", "hatred", "balance", "greed", "generosity"], "text": "<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.alternate-economy.com/Images/joy.jpg\" width=\"450\"></p>\n<p>In our world today, many people live their lives in the pursuit of this one aspect of emotion above all others. The one constant that keeps popping up in all of the aspects of emotion is the concept of balance leading to their healthiest expressions. Joy, often referred to as happiness, is a bit of a catch 22 for this reason. When we pursue joy above all other aspects of emotion, we live out of balance. When we are living out of balance we find that the opposite expression of joy has a chance to make an appearance.</p>\n<p>Remorse is the opposite expression of this aspect of emotion. Remorse is a selfish emotion because there is the expectation that happiness is unattainable for you alone. Joy is often associated with happiness. The pursuit of happiness is interestingly enough a selfish pursuit. When we assume that joy can only be attained through happiness we assume that we must always be happy and so we selfishly attempt to only participate in the things we enjoy doing. Joy does not only include happiness though. Joy has many other expressions. Pride is a form of joy; when we feel a sense of accomplishment at completing a difficult task. There is little happiness in this process. But there is definitely joy at its end. Anticipation is also a form of joy. We have not received our happiness yet, but the excitement of receiving it soon is certainly a joyful thing. And what of affection? Is there not joy in the giving and receiving of affection? Joy comes in many forms.</p>\n<p>Remorse enters the situation when we assume that joy requires a perpetual sense of happiness. Not only is this false information, but it is very destructive. Now when we are not happy we become remorseful. Being the selfish form, remorse centers around self-pity. When we are remorseful we feel like the world is very unfair. We see everyone else having fun all the time. Why do we have to work and do chores and all the things we hate doing? We should be allowed to have fun all the time. That is what freedom is, isn&#8217;t it?</p>\n<p>This position is one of gross ignorance. Joy has nothing to do with having fun all the time. It is impossible to have fun all the time. Things are fun because they are new, or rare. The more we do something the less fun it becomes. If we do something over and over again it either becomes boring or a passion. But something we are passionate about is not really something fun. It is more than that. It brings us true joy, but it is often difficult to master our passions. It requires patience and skill and rarely is all that much fun. All in all, doing things repetitively never leads to much fun. So the only way to continuously have fun is to continuously do new and different things. How realistic is it to expect that we will be able to constantly try new and fun things in our lives? The pursuit of happiness necessitates failure. You will never be happy all the time, because happiness implies stimulation of the new and exciting kind.</p>\n<p>You can, however, be joyful all the time. When you are joyful you live in balance. You understand that happiness is a form of joy. An important one, but still only a part of a greater whole. When we live in joy we have the expectation that life is happiness. This is a position of gratitude. From this perspective, we cherish every joyful moment for what it is. When we live in remorse, we compare each joyful moment to the last in an attempt to find out if we have gotten any closer to happiness. The funny thing about this approach is that each happy moment is in fact equal. But memory has a tendency to play tricks on us. Because we long for happiness above all else, we put it up on a pedestal. So when we try to compare our current happiness to our imagined previous happiness, it never quite measures up. Not because we are truly less happy. But because we are living in remorse and so we are tainting our current experience. Instead of truly living in the moment and fully experiencing our joy, like we profess to be doing, we are constantly checking in to make sure we are in fact having fun. Remorse leads only to more remorse. By selfishly hoping to increase our happiness at the expense of all else, we focus only on being happy. The act of focusing on being happy makes us either force our happiness or worse still, wait for it arrive.</p>\n<p>Joy is none of these things. Joy comes from gratitude because it is the assumption that when we live in love happiness will seek us out. We cannot help but be grateful when we receive happiness in our lives. We are wise enough to know that happiness cannot exist all the time. You have to have a reference point for happiness to exist. If it always existed it would cease to exist because there would be nothing to compare it to.</p>\n<p>Joy is understanding that happiness will come to you as long as you live in balance. Sometimes you will not be happy, but that only makes the times when you are all the more special. Joy, like all aspects of emotion, is cyclical. Once we begin to realize that joy is not something you seek out, but something that arrives through balanced loving, we are able recognize joy more often. By living in joy we are able to see the joy in everything. We are no longer comparing our happiness to the last experience. Now we are investigating our happiness in its every detail. Soon we find that everything in our lives makes us joyful. Not because they make us happy, but because we are able to appreciate every aspect of every moment. Joy is appreciation, not happiness. When we live in joy we feel a sense of satisfaction in knowing that everything in life is connected. It is the connections between events that bring us joy, not the events themselves. Once we begin to open ourselves to the idea that joy is all around us, we begin to see that the path to joy is more important than the joy itself. Once we are able to see this, we are able to always feel joyful. Because we are always on the path to joy. We may not always be experiencing joy. But we are always on the path towards it, as long as we do not live in remorse.</p>\n<p>Remorse is a wounded emotion. It is selfish because we feel that we deserve to be happy all the time. So when we are not happy we feel that the world is treating us unfairly. This causes us to avoid things that are hard at first or that are not particularly pleasant. The longer we put them off, the harder they become. Once we finally do get around to doing the things that make us unhappy they truly are no fun. This only reinforces in us that we should try to stick to happiness. But happiness will not arrive all the time. It cannot. So we perpetuate our remorse with each new miserable task. And since happiness requires an aspect of newness, as we age we find happiness less and less while living in remorse. This only causes more remorse. &#8220;Oh to be young. To have it all. If only I knew then what I know now.&#8221; Remorse creates more remorse.</p>\n<p>Joy is a healthy emotion. It comes from gratitude because we feel that happiness comes naturally. We cannot help but be grateful for the happiness we receive when it does finally arrive. Because we were expecting it to arrive, yet at the same time we are able to understand that happiness does not occur at all times, when it does arrive we cherish every moment of it. Joy perpetuates joy. Soon we learn that the path towards joy is just as joyful as joy itself. Once we have reached this stage we will truly always live in joy. Because now we have learned to appreciate every detail of our lives, good and bad. We live in balance, so we understand that love includes more than just happiness. Joy springs forth from an understanding and connection to love. When we are able to accept that love exists in many forms we begin to see joy in every moment of our lives. Joy creates more joy.</p>\n<p>Read Next:</p>\n<table width=\"250\" border=\"1\" bgcolor=\"#99ccff\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://alternate-economy.com/wordpress/blog/2011/12/17/gratitude/\">Gratitude</a>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.alternate-economy.com\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.alternate-economy.com/Images/banner-alternate-economy.jpg\" alt=\"The Alternate Economy\" width=\"450\"></a></p>\n", "post_id": 2118, "location": false, "date": "05-16-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["emotion", "alternate", "love", "cancer", "give", "age of aquarius", "gemini", "thanks", "selfishness", "alternative", "hate", "fear", "film", "astrology", "gratitude", "selfish", "story", "inheritance", "peace", "writing", "passion", "happiness", "remorse", "receiving", "hope", "economy", "compassion", "joy", "aquarius", "judgement", "protection", "security", "loss", "receive", "freedom", "foolishness", "movies", "universe", "hatred", "balance", "greed", "generosity"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/freedom.jpg\"><img src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/freedom.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200\" alt=\"\" title=\"Freedom\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2122\" /></a></p>\n<p>We currently live in the free world. We are told that we are free because we are able to own property, seek out paid employment and elect our leaders democratically. These are all important freedoms, and we are lucky to have them. But how free do these freedoms make us? Are having freedoms the same as being free?</p>\n<p>Let us first examine our supposed freedoms. One of the major freedoms that we are told that we possess is the right to own personal property. Most times this property is in the form of land or housing. We are free because we can own our own home. But how many people truly own their home? Although we are free to own property, the price of owning property is such that most people are required to go to a bank to receive a loan to help them purchase their home. Not many people are able to drop $200,000 in cash on a new home. So, for the majority of people, our freedom to own property is subject to receiving a loan from a bank first. And banks have to right to refuse our request for a loan if they feel that we will be a liability. So now, only those with sufficient standing amongst the banks are free to own property. And even once they purchase this property with the loan from the bank, they still do not legally own that property. If they fall behind in their payments, the bank has the right to claim the property as their own and evict the \u201cowners\u201d. It seems that the freedom to own property really only applies to those wealthy enough to purchase it without the help of a bank. Because even if the bank will help you to purchase your property, they still technically own it for the next 25 years, until you have paid off the mortgage in full.</p>\n<p>We are also told that we are free because we are able to seek out employment which allows us to earn money. This is an interesting freedom, because choosing not to seek out employment means choosing not to receive money. Since we have established that in order to exercise your freedom to own property you need a substantial amount of wealth, it seems that choosing not to seek employment would be rather foolish. Seeking employment is more of a responsibility than a freedom in our current system. Add to that the fact that the United States is currently upholding a 9% unemployment rate (with this number only including those members of society that are actively seeking assistance from the government) and all of a sudden seeking employment has become more of a challenge, than a freedom. We must seek employment to exercise our freedom to own property, yet there is not enough employment to go around.</p>\n<p>Finally, we are told that we are free because we live in a democratic system which allows us to vote. But how often do we get to vote? And what are we voting on? In our current democracy we are voting once every four years, or so, in order to elect a representative. We then grant this representative the power to conduct the rest of the voting for us. When any issues about our livelihood or well-being arise, we defer to the authority of our elected leader and allow them to decide how to vote for us. So in reality, if voting is what makes us free, then we are only free while we are electing our representative. After that, the representative is free to vote for us and we become their servant, following their decisions. If we do not like the decisions they are making for us we can choose to elect a new representative, but we will have to wait the appropriate number of years until we are free to vote again. Until that time we must remain faithful to our representative and follow their new laws. It seems that unless you are one of these representatives, you are really only free one day every four years, or about 0.1% of the time.</p>\n<p>It seems that all of our supposed freedoms come with some rather heavy restrictions. The very word freedom seems to contradict the idea of restrictions, however. So what is freedom? Do we truly possess it in our current system?</p>\n<p>Freedom is the essential right to do whatever it is that brings you Joy without receiving anyone\u2019s permission. If there is any restriction to freedom, it is a moral one. Your Joy should not be harming anyone else in the process. Other than that, there are no restrictions to freedom. That is what freedom is; a lack of restrictions.</p>\n<p>So how do we design a system where freedom is a reality, accessible to all? It seems a community that removed the restrictions from the current system would fare much better. Housing is far too costly. Make whatever excuses for the cost of housing that you want, in order for us to be free we need to change this. Ultimately, all housing should be free. Free housing for a free people. In the same way, employment must be stimulated. It seems the easiest way to stimulate employment would be to allow people to pursue the career they are most passionate about. If communities \u201cgo local\u201d and begin to produce most of their essential goods themselves, rather than relying on super-corporations which mass produce items at the cheapest rate possible, the community will find that they easily meet their need for employment. Humans are specialists, and we will naturally filter into all of the jobs required to meet a community\u2019s needs. By accepting this truth and working with it, employment should never be an issue for humanity. Finally, instead of a democratic system where representatives are elected to make our decisions for us, perhaps one where everyone has the right to suggest new ideas and then to vote on them would be more appropriate. If people choose not to vote, that is their choice, but they should have the opportunity. Freedom means having a say in the laws that are created in your community.</p>\n<p>We may not quite live in a free world yet, but we are certainly on the right track. We have come a long way in the last 300 years, but we still have further to go. We should not allow our freedoms to let us forget that we ultimately want to be free. Free of restrictions.</p>\n", "post_id": 2121, "location": false, "date": "05-16-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["existentialism", "question", "everything", "reason", "curiosity", "answer", "varungenius", "ask"], "text": "<p>Uncommon in this common world,<br />\nI rely on instinct, neither vision nor word;<br />\nUnlike any common man,<br />\nI do what I should, not what I can;<br />\nDifferent from any common perspective,<br />\nI see through uncommon angles with no aim, no objective;<br />\nSeparated from the common path of virtuality,<br />\nI walk on a different path, where dreams become reality.<br />\n<a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/question-mark.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-2125\" title=\"3d human with a red question mark\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/question-mark.jpg?w=300&#038;h=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a><br />\nI talk of religion, I talk of spirituality,<br />\nBut when I question, texts become reality;<br />\nI talk of politics, I talk of crime,<br />\nBut when I question, laws become prime;<br />\nI talk of relations, I talk of humanity,<br />\nBut when I question, everything becomes formality;<br />\nI talk of blind faith, I talk of superstition,<br />\nBut when I question, they become religion;<br />\nI talk of nature, I talk of equality of living,<br />\nBut when I question, caring becomes killing;<br />\nI talk of honesty, I talk of self-satisfaction,<br />\nBut when I question, money becomes passion;<br />\nI talk of knowledge, I talk of practicality,<br />\nBut when I question, numbers become personality;<br />\nI talk of innovation, I talk of technology,<br />\nBut when I question, &#8220;new&#8221; becomes a terminology;<br />\nI talk of music, I talk of art,<br />\nBut when I question, meanings fall apart;<br />\nI talk about wrong, I talk about right,<br />\nBut when I question, &#8220;big becomes bright&#8221;;<br />\nI talk of love, I talk of emotions,<br />\nBut when I question, reasons become illusions;<br />\nI talk of answer, I talk of reason,<br />\nBut when I question, silence becomes a prison.</p>\n<p>Everything that happens, happens for a reason,<br />\nQuestion any time, any day, any season;<br />\nFor all that has a question, must have an answer, I believe,<br />\nIt&#8217;s the home for curiosity, something I can&#8217;t leave;<br />\nThere&#8217;s nothing wrong in questioning, be it anything,<br />\nLive your life for a reason, live curious, QUESTION EVERYTHING&#8230;..!!!</p>\n<p>\u00a9<a href=\"http://varungenius.wordpress.com\">Varun K.

While Happiness is a temporary possession &#8212; it comes &amp; goes, &amp; we chase it round &amp; round.

It is pretty much all I do.</p>\n<p>Then it hit me yesterday, as I was driving to work.  The perfect example.</p>\n<p>Every day, when I get in my car, the first thing I do is roll down the windows and turn up my music.  I set the dial to my favourite radio station and I start singing.  Really singing.  Truly belting it out.  I sing at the top of my voice.  And I dance too.  I bop and weave.  I groove to the rhythm.  And I sing beautifully.</p>\n<p>I rarely know the words, but I am very good at hitting the melody.  I have perfect pitch, or damn close to it, and an uncanny ability to mimic a song even when hearing it for the first time.  But most importantly, I love to sing.  It cheers me up.  It distracts me from my worries.  And it puts a smile on my face.</p>\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter if I am stuck in stand still traffic.  It doesn&#8217;t matter if I am stopped at a red light and surrounded by pedestrians.  It doesn&#8217;t matter if I am whipping down the highway.  I am singing and smiling and dancing inside my car.</p>\n<p>I am Hope.</p>\n<p>It is true I Love to sing.  But mostly I know that others Love to hear me sing.  And I also know that everyone Loves to see someone beating the odds and having a good time in their car.  I don&#8217;t sing and dance to be noticed.  I sing and dance to bring a smile to another&#8217;s face. There is a subtle difference.  I do want to be noticed.  But not because I think I look cool, or sexy, or intelligent.  I want to be noticed because I look Joyful.  I want people to see how much Love I possess.  All the time.  I want to inspire Hope in others.  I want to prove to them that someone out there is able to stay positive.  I drive a junk heap.  It is severely dented and rusted and the Toyota symbol has fallen off&#8230;  I do not look rich.  I do not look attractive.  I just look happy.</p>\n<p>And do you know what?  It works.  Every time.  All the time.  Every day people catch a glimpse of me looking like an idiot in my car and every day they stop and smile.  Sometimes cars will even pace me on the highway until I look over to acknowledge them. Then they wave and laugh and drive off.  This happens to me regularly.</p>\n<p>I am Hope.</p>\n<p>Today I came to realize that I possess a unique skill.  One which may not be held by many other people.  I possess the ability to inspire True Hope in those around me.  Because I know that what I say is true.  I know that Love is attainable.  I know that peace is now.  I know that you are good.  And I know that we are better off together.</p>\n<p>I will do it if you want me to.  I will be that guy.  I will show you it can be done.  Because I am Hope.</p>\n", "post_id": 2149, "location": false, "date": "05-18-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Cold War", "joy", "MindMindful", "M.A.J.", "Mutually Assured Destruction", "8 Week Challenge"], "text": "<p>Herewith another rumination on the 6th topic of the <a title=\"8 Week Challenge\" href=\"http://wp.me/p21f5h-o8\">8 Week Challenge</a>, JOY &#8230;&#8230;. &amp; perhaps a reason for why Joy is so difficult to find &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.</p>\n<p>As I am of the famous &amp; infamous generational cadre known as the <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Baby boomer\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_boomer\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">Baby Boomers</a>, I grew up during the <a title=\"Cold War\" href=\"http://www.history.com/topics/cold-war\" rel=\"historycom\" target=\"_blank\">Cold War</a>.

And, then it held sway over the next two generations also. Some families in the U.S. built bunkers in their backyards &amp; stocked them with canned goods. The suspicion of &amp; hunt for Communists pervaded nearly every government action. Children learned to &#8220;duck &amp; cover&#8221; through drills in elementary school. We all waited for &#8216;the bomb&#8217; to be\u00a0dropped. Both countries, along with their satellites &amp; allies, built up their military arsenals, &amp; no American politician could afford to be labeled a &#8216;dove&#8217; re the Communist threat. To justify the arms race, fear of &#8220;them&#8221; &amp; their threat to our way of life was a constant refrain in public life. To stave off this nascent threat, <a title=\"Mutual assured destruction\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">Mutually Assured Destruction</a>\u00a0came to be the pervasive government philosophy. <em>The belief that survival depended on the ability to destroy became a way of life.</em></p>\n<p><em>Say, what?!?</em> Yes, we grew up knowing that the only thing keeping us free of the insidious Communist hordes was that our military-industrial complex was the greater of the two. <em>Peace through superior firepower</em>. Until they caught up. Then, we had to increase our potential for deadly force &#8230;&#8230;.. then, they did &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. then, we did &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.. then ..<a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/images1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright  wp-image-2156\" title=\"Mushroom cloud   www.thewordzombie.com\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/images1.jpg?w=251&#038;h=201\" alt=\"\" width=\"251\" height=\"201\" /></a>&#8230;&#8230;. The effect of this was that for all of my lifetime, before the fall of the Soviet Union in the early 1990&#8217;s, we all lived with the presumptive world view that being able to <em>out-destroy someone was a supreme virtue</em>. Put another way, <em>being the most lethal was a higher value than being the most benevolent</em>. No wonder both countries are in such societal trouble now. Under the doctrinal dictates of Mutually Assured Destruction, both countries created destructive cultures. <em>Is it any accident that the acronym for this is M.A.D.?!?</em></p>\n<p>Within such an environment, which went largely unexamined in the developing minds of the U.S.&#8217;s children, where was any emphasis on Joy? Oh, there was plenty of emphasis on <em>being happy</em>, on chasing pleasure, on fulfilling the individual&#8217;s selfish desires. But there was little cultural teaching on creating the enduring benefits of peace, of community, of oneness, of kindness, of respect toward those of &#8216;other&#8217; mindsets. I&#8217;d argue that it was impossible to create those enduring values, when the culture&#8217;s emphasis was on the near-term ability to prevail through assured destruction. No wonder Americans traveling anywhere in the world heard &#8220;Yankee go home!&#8221;</p>\n<p>NOW I can understand one of the reasons it is so hard (for me, &amp; many of my generation) to be truly joyful &#8212; we were all taught, tacitly, that being destructive, &amp; being the ultimate winner, w<a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/imagescalrpd2h.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2159 alignleft\" title=\"Compassion vs cruelty   www.examiner.com\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/imagescalrpd2h.jpg?w=189&#038;h=267\" alt=\"\" width=\"189\" height=\"267\" /></a>as of the utmost importance. And toward that end, the Powers That Be kept beating the drums of fear, suspicion, division, dominance. ((And they still do!)) These qualities &amp; paradigms are the exact opposites of Joy &#8212; Joy cannot exist easily, if it all, in such a culture as ours has come to be. Mutually Assured Destruction, aimed at the former Soviet Union, has nearly destroyed <em>us.</em></p>\n<p>What&#8217;s the antidote, then?? How to undo this long- institutionalized, &amp; psychically enshrined paradigm? By making it unworkable &amp; replacing it with another, much better world view: <em>Mutually Assured JOY! </em>The roots of M.A.D. have\u00a0 dug in deeply, &amp; its poisonous ivy has a chokehold on most governments &amp; many cultures. So, uprooting this toxic view of life will take some energy. We Buddhists, those of the <a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.wordpress.com\">Alternate Economy</a>, &amp; many, many others around the world, are reaching for a new way to be. We seek to create a better, finer <em>way of living</em>. We all want a world where a sense of community reigns instead of division, where love is more pervasive than hate, right? Compassion is the answer. By caring for one another as for ourselves, we can begin to live in terms of We instead of You vs Me. Our exploration of Joy this past week has made it pretty clear that we understand that Happiness comes &amp; goes, &amp; in the grasping after it, people become selfish. Perhaps this is the flip side of M.A.D. &#8212; the urge toward world dominance implies an ultimately finite view &amp; perhaps we instinctively feel that Happiness is limited too. But Joy, the bigger, more encompassing version of being happy is enduring, it <em>can</em>\u00a0include everyone. As it is more a way of being than a thing to be had, Joy doesn&#8217;t come with the same kind of internally presumed limitations.</p>\n<p>So, I&#8217;ve sussed out an underlying presumption &#8212; Mutually Assured Destruction &#8212; buried very very deeply within me. It&#8217;s one I didn&#8217;t realize was <a title=\"My post, 'Lurking, lurking .............'\" href=\"http://wp.me/p1zocx-jw\">lurking in my psyche</a>, but now I can see its influence has been at work upon me my whole life.

Change is never single\u2026..it\u2019s many! When was the last time you tried to change something or someone? There may be many instances when you tried to change the world, but were you successful or are you still trying? Does it ever occur to you that you reach a stage when you feel that the whole world has gone mad? But what if you are the only one who has gone mad? How can you change the whole world by being just YOU?? And why do you think the world needs a change? Can\u2019t it be that your perspective of looking at things is not right? Or maybe you haven\u2019t seen everything you need to see!!!<a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/change.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-2166\" title=\"change\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/change.jpg?w=450&#038;h=281\" alt=\"\" width=\"450\" height=\"281\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Your world is limited; you know only that part of your world which gives you something that is worth living. But this world is not just yours; it\u2019s shared by millions of others too. And we all are connected in some or the other way. You can\u2019t say that you do what you want to without caring about others. Because what you do, has to do something with others too. A little change in any one of us, affects the others too. But that doesn\u2019t mean you have to think a lot before taking any step\u2026\u2026NO! This simply means that you have to be GOOD\u2026\u2026.right or wrong\u2026..doesn\u2019t actually matter. You might be thinking that how can a single person bring the change! That\u2019s a very common excuse to ignore the change. But let me tell you something: <strong><em>\u201cA single person can bring about a change even bigger than he himself ever expected, because when change takes place, it\u2019s not just YOU who\u2019s going to be affected; there are millions!!\u201d</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">The only thing that\u2019s most difficult in bringing the change is <strong>the beginning. </strong>Once you know how to begin, then the toughest part is almost over, because you begin alone. Just a good start, then everything goes right automatically, as long as you are strong in your beliefs. It\u2019s like a chain reaction; if the initiation is good, then everything\u2019s going to be good; you just need to be strong till the end. <strong>I\u2019ve also decided to bring the change not because I think the world has gone insane; but I think the world is perfectly fine, it\u2019s the perspective of people that\u2019s blurred</strong>. People are unknowingly dragged into things that separate them from their own SELF. There needs to be someone or something that can bring to their notice the things which they have not seen or realized in their life yet. People need to be aware of a lot of things that can help keep them close to their SELF, not separated.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Every one of us is capable of bringing the change; a change large enough that it can\u2019t be ignored. But change is never single as I said earlier; when it occurs, it affects many!! It brings many other changes along with it because everything\u2019s related\u2026\u2026everything\u2019s connected! So, when you decide to change something or someone, be sure to check for the consequences, because it\u2019s not only about you!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">When you begin, you are one, but slowly you\u2019ll find people like you coming to you from nowhere. You may be the leader or the follower, doesn\u2019t matter; what matters is that you\u2019ll be a part of the change, be proud of it! Remember, change is in your hands, you just need to start well, rest all will go in the flow!!!!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">\u00a9<a href=\"http://varungenius.wordpress.com\">Varun K.

In general I am very forgiving.  In fact I am probably considered by most to be too forgiving.  I truly feel forgiveness is the key to allowing Love to blossom in your life.  I have forgiven my ex girlfriends, my parents, my brother, my employers, my friends, strangers, enemies and even myself.  I have forgiven cheaters and liars and sexual abusers.  I forgive the thieves in my life and the alcoholics and the maniacs.  I forgive the self cutting, the MDMA taken in secret behind my back, and the one who drank herself to death.  I forgive myself for being so stupid in Scotland.</p>\n<p>But recently I have encountered a situation that I find difficult to fathom.  It is, of course, related to forgiving <em>myself</em>.  The most difficult challenge of all.  It is not so much that I do not forgive myself for my new desires.  I do.  It is more that I am trying to repress them.  Deny these new desires exist.  Hope they will disappear if I distract myself enough.</p>\n<p>This is not what the forgiveness challenge is about.  This is avoidance.</p>\n<p>Forgiveness is about acknowledging our faults and trying to understand where they emanate from, in order to help control the behaviour in the future.  So today I will finally lay it all out on the table.</p>\n<p>I desperately want to buy the new video game Diablo III.  I am Peace.  I am Love.  I am Hope.  And I am a Bloodthirsty Demon Slayer.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/diablo_3_red-1536.jpg\"><img src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/diablo_3_red-1536.jpg?w=300&#038;h=187\" alt=\"\" title=\"diablo_3_red-1536\" width=\"300\" height=\"187\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2176\" /></a></p>\n<p>I, Tristan Nagler, the founder of the Alternate Economy and the author of the 8 Week Challenge to Live in Love, want nothing more than to lock myself in my room for a month and play Diablo III until I go blind.  I want to butcher vast armies of demons and undead.  I want to launch fireballs into the crowd, summon forth powerful monsters to fight at my side and hunt for rare and beautiful treasures.  The question is, why?</p>\n<p>Why do I want these things?  Why do I feel so strongly that I must play this game that is nothing but carnage and destruction?</p>\n<p>It turns out, that I grew up in this world, just like the rest of you.  I watched the Television ads, I witnessed the news stories, I sought out the violent films.  I was very well brainwashed, and I still am.  But there is even more to it than that.  I grew up during a time when computer games took on a whole new life.  I was never really allowed to buy any gaming stations as a child, but I did always have a family computer.  I loved games involving knights and wizards and dragons.  I would play these games as much as I was allowed when a small boy.  It was the magic that really got to me.  There was nothing I loved more than the idea of being able to manipulate and control magic.  Then I turned 15 and Diablo came out&#8230;  I was blown away.  I had never seen anything like this game before.  The graphics where spectacular for the time, the dungeons and treasures randomized, so no two games were alike.  Then there were the spells.  So many spells.  And weapons and armor of almost infinite variation.  Or so it seemed at least.  Diablo was the first game I ever beat entirely and the only game I have beaten more than once.  I was in Love.</p>\n<p>Now, here we are 15 years later and Diablo III has been released.  But I am a different person.  So why do I feel like I cannot resist this game?</p>\n<p>The magic.  It has always been the magic.  I cannot resist the urge to tame the elements.  To master the arts of incantation.  Since I can remember I have pretended that I am a wizard during my fantasies.  And do you know what?  It is because it is true.</p>\n<p>I am a wizard.  Or at least I was.  A very long time ago.  I know it.  It has to be true.</p>\n<p>To prove it I will give you two examples.  The first happened but a few months ago when I met a good friend for the first time. She is a crystal healer and I met her when I found her small stall at a restaurant I worked at.  She had an array of crystals displayed and some information packets.  She is very knowledgeable in these sorts of things, and has a fair bit of knowledge in most energetic healing.  When I went to introduce myself, she asked me to take a look at the crystals and pick out one that was calling to me.  After a few seconds I selected a rather plain, dull greyish, green stone named Labradorite.  I chose it because I thought it winked at me.  Seriously.  I saw a small blue flicker of light come from inside the crystal.  So I picked it up.</p>\n<p>And my new friend looked at me and said, &#8220;I see I have a Wizard on my hands.  You have chosen a stone that only speaks to magical people.  It is almost never selected.  I see it blinking at you.  It only does that around Wizards.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ok, so maybe that alone doesn&#8217;t mean all that much, but again I was given another example.  This one happened on Thursday of this week.  I sent a recent photo of mine to one of my good friends that lives some distance away.  She showed her 3 year old son the photo and he replied with &#8220;Mom, you are lucky to have a Wizard for a friend.&#8221;  From the mouths of Babes.  I was not wearing any costume.  I do not have long white hair, or a pointy hat, or glasses.</p>\n<p>The thing is I <em>am</em> a Wizard.  And certain people are able to recognize it.  Those less concerned with keeping up appearances.  That is why I cannot resist the urge to play games that involve magic and violence.  It is not the violence that lures me.  It is the magic.</p>\n<p>I forgive myself for wanting to play Diablo III.  The truth is I do not have time for such silly distractions at the moment.  Nor am I keen on all the violent scenes I will be forced to watch.  I will instead divert my attention to creating real magic.  I am quite confident I have done it in the past, in other lives.  I am sure that magic exists.  It has just been forgotten.</p>\n<p>I would like to start small.  Nothing crazy.  All I want to do is light a candle&#8230; with my mind.  It can&#8217;t be that hard.  A little focus.  A dash of heat.  Maybe an energectic spark or two.  Surely I can light a candle.</p>\n<p>I am a Wizard after all.</p>\n", "post_id": 2169, "location": false, "date": "05-19-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Life", "death", "love", "freedom", "peace", "passion", "change", "enemies"], "text": "<p>The harsher the oppression &#8212; physical and non-physical &#8212; the stronger it grows: the desire \u2013 the <em>passion</em>, the <em>need</em> \u2013 for Freedom.</p>\n<p>Love and appreciate your so-called enemies, both conscious (living beings) and circumstantial, for the critical role they play; they do you a grand service.

I took the blame.  But of course, now we have a wounded ego to deal with.  So the anger begins.  Now the new girl is a complete pain in the ass.  Everything she does is wrong.  Everything she says is stupid.  A constant stream of criticism emerges.  But it was the chef that screwed up&#8230;</p>\n<p>I can only listen to this for so long&#8230;</p>\n<p>So I stood at the opposite side of the kitchen and loudly told the bartender, across the room,  how I was forced to cover for the chef tonight.  &#8220;How embarrassing&#8221;, I say.  And later, when the nastiness doesn&#8217;t stop, I proclaim to no one in particular.  &#8220;I find self important people so funny.  Look at me, I&#8217;m so important.&#8221;  And finally, when I can take it no more, I look the chef right in the eyes and say &#8220;The amazing thing is, the Nightmare will never end until you wake up.&#8221;</p>\n<p>We create this ridiculous system.  We participate in it.  And then we abuse others when we look bad.  This world we live in is truly a Nightmare.</p>\n<p>Until you wake up.</p>\n<p>Then all the anger just seems so crazy.  So useless.  So divisive.  So unnecessary.   </p>\n<p>I know I should keep my mouth shut.  But seriously, wake up.</p>\n", "post_id": 2180, "location": false, "date": "05-20-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["emotion", "alternate", "love", "cancer", "give", "age of aquarius", "gemini", "thanks", "selfishness", "alternative", "hate", "fear", "film", "astrology", "gratitude", "selfish", "story", "inheritance", "peace", "writing", "passion", "happiness", "remorse", "receiving", "hope", "economy", "compassion", "joy", "aquarius", "judgement", "protection", "security", "loss", "receive", "freedom", "foolishness", "movies", "universe", "hatred", "balance", "greed", "generosity"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/gratitude1.jpg\"><img src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/gratitude1.jpg?w=300&#038;h=196\" alt=\"\" title=\"gratitude1\" width=\"300\" height=\"196\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2185\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>What is Gratitude?</strong></p>\n<p>Throughout this challenge we have looked at 6 ways of expressing Love.  If you have been paying attention to the core essays, you will notice a trend in all of these expressions.  Each one has a negative and positive expression.  When we live in selfishness, we express Love negatively and enter greed, judgment, fear, hatred, loss and remorse.  But if we are able to live in Gratitude, we find that all of the positive expressions of Love begin to manifest: Generosity, Compassion, Hope, Passion, Receiving and Joy.</p>\n<p>It seems that the key to living in Love is maintaining a sense of Gratitude in your life.  When we cultivate a sense of Gratitude we also spread our feelings of good will to others.  Gratitude is a position that we take.  When we see the world as being a gift, we are allowed to more freely appreciate that gift.  If life is all about the experience and Love is created through positive connections, then Gratitude is truly essential.  For without it we enter a stagnation, an unwillingness to move forward and a loss of Love.  If selfishness is turning your focus inward in a negative way, Gratitude is turning your focus outward in a positive way.</p>\n<p>The Idea of Love arrives when we Balance our Emotions with Gratitude.</p>\n<table width=\"150\" border=\"1\" bgcolor=\"#99ccff\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;\" align=\"center\"><a href=\"http://alternate-economy.com/wordpress/blog/2011/12/17/gratitude/\">Core Essay on Gratitude</a></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/badge.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1497\" title=\"badge\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/badge.jpg?w=300&#038;h=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>This Weeks Challenge</strong></p>\n<p>Why is Gratitude so important? If we take a good, honest look at our lives, we will probably notice a common trend. It&#8217;s the &#8220;grass is always greener&#8221; syndrome that we all fall victim to. We get so caught up with what we don&#8217;t have that we very often fail to appreciate what we do have. Nearly every facet of our lives can be influenced by Gratitude, or the absence of it, in some respect. It&#8217;s far more effortless to wallow in self pity than it is to acknowledge our good qualities. It&#8217;s more &#8220;natural&#8221; to loathe our neighbour for their more expensive possessions than to appreciate our own abundances. It&#8217;s simpler to idealize would-be relationships than it is to see the value in the relationships we already have. It is always easier to yearn for something else than it is to be thankful for what we have. So, again, why is Gratitude so important? It&#8217;s important because acknowledging that this life has given us all that we need instead of focusing on what we think we should have is vital to being Balanced and Living in Love. </p>\n<p>When we pause and begin to take notice and be grateful for the life we have chosen, because we have chosen it, we begin to see a life of abundance rather than a life of deficiency. The goal for this week, as it has been throughout, is to change your inner dialogue to one of Gratitude. You will accomplish this by reflecting on all of the ways you have begun to Balance your emotions so far in this challenge and being grateful for not only the changes you have made, but for your ability to make them in the first place.</p>\n<p>The following examples are suggestions only. Feel free to incorporate as many of them into your daily life as you are able to, or create your own examples of Gratitude.</p>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:awards@alternate-economy.com\">Send Entries to awards@alternate-economy.com</a></p>\n<p>The following challenge is split into six categories. Please complete each category and send an email with an essay describing how your week of Living in Gratitude has changed you. This essay can be anywhere from 500 to 1000 words and will become a post on this blog.</p>\n<table width=\"150\" border=\"1\" bgcolor=\"#99ccff\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;\" align=\"center\">Gratitude from Generosity</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>To start, we will go back to week 1.  Spreading gratitude through Generosity is easy enough.  But this challenge is not so much about creating Gratitude in others.  It is about fostering a sense Gratitude within you.  For this week, take a look at your life and the opportunities you have had for Generosity.  Take a look at your contributions for the Generosity week.  Take some time to truly understand how lucky you are to be in a position to give of your excess.  Be Grateful that you have an excess, of anything, to give.  Often times we get caught up wishing we could give more.  Imagine if you were unable to give what you can?  Be Grateful for your life and the Generosity it allows, and write about it for me.</p>\n<table width=\"150\" border=\"1\" bgcolor=\"#99ccff\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;\" align=\"center\">Gratitude from Compassion</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Again, since Compassion is an outward expression, it is easy enough to spread Gratitude through acts of Compassion.  But this weeks challenge will ask you to go a little deeper.  This week we will look at the past traumas we have suffered and be Grateful for them.  For without the abuses and suffering in our life, we would never be able to be the Compassionate people we are today.  Compassion arrives when we realize that suffering is so unnecessary and that we do not wish others to feel what we have felt, or worse.  If we did not suffer in some measure, then how could we be Compassionate.  This week, write about how you are Grateful for the suffering in your life, because it has made you the strong and Compassionate person you are today.</p>\n<table width=\"150\" border=\"1\" bgcolor=\"#99ccff\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;\" align=\"center\">Gratitude from Hope</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>When we Live in Hope, we always move towards our goals with positive action.  This creates a sense of Gratitude most profoundly and should be our easiest section this week.  Take some time to look at how your life has progressed and the actions you have taken that have created a sense of Hope.  Be Grateful for the opportunities you have had and successes you have made.  Remember the goals from your past that you achieved and transfer that feeling towards a continued sense of Hope for the future.  Gratitude from Hope is one of the more obvious types, but it doesn&#8217;t hurt to remind ourselves of how much we have to be Grateful for.</p>\n<table width=\"150\" border=\"1\" bgcolor=\"#99ccff\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;\" align=\"center\">Gratitude from Passion</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Our Passions are what fuel our desires and satisfy our soul.  Without them we would have nothing to strive for.  Nothing to work for.  And nothing to live for.  We are our Passions, in a most direct sense and they are what make us unique.  Our equality comes from our ability to Love, yet our Passions are what make us special.  This week, write about how Grateful you are for the time you have spent with your Passions during your life.  Without this respite, we would truly have nothing to look forward to.  What better cause for Gratitude?</p>\n<table width=\"150\" border=\"1\" bgcolor=\"#99ccff\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;\" align=\"center\">Gratitude from Receiving</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>As we touched on during week 5 of this challenge, the art of Receiving is mastered only after we are able to graciously take a compliment.  In Gratitude we see that we encourage others to continue treating us with Love.  Without some show of appreciation, we can hardly expect our Receiving to continue.  This week, I would like you to take the time to sit down and sincerely thank all of the people in your life, who have helped you to get to where you are.  Let them know that without their Love, you would truly have nothing.  And that is why you are so Grateful to them.</p>\n<table width=\"150\" border=\"1\" bgcolor=\"#99ccff\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;\" align=\"center\">Gratitude from Joy</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Finally, I would ask that you take some time this week and look to the Joyful moments in your life.  Be Grateful for the fun times, the moments of pride and success.  Appreciate the anticipation, the butterflies in your stomach right before a Joyful moment.  Truly look back upon the last few weeks, months and years and reflect on how without those moments your life would be such a drag.  We need Joy to keep us actively participating in life, and we need Gratitude to allow us to fully appreciate each Joyful moment to its fullest.  By embracing the Joy, and being thankful for it, we only allow it to blossom.  Before long, we find Joy and Gratitude in every moment.</p>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:awards@alternate-economy.com\">Send Entries to awards@alternate-economy.com</a></p>\n", "post_id": 2183, "location": false, "date": "05-22-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["emotion", "love", "thanks", "having a laugh", "alternative", "sustainableutopia", "happiness", "gratitude", "self", "sustainable utopia", "passion", "receiving", "hope", "2012", "compassion", "joy", "8 Week Challenge", "loss", "balance", "receive", "challenge", "generosity", "spirit of receiving", "truth", "surprise surprise"], "text": "<p>Yeah yeah, I know, I&#8217;ve fallen behind in my posts. I&#8217;ll admit it, I&#8217;ve been putting this one off. I knew that it would be a hard one for me and I honestly just didn&#8217;t want to do it. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I could have gone through the motions and pulled a half-way decent post out of my- er.. you know, but it would have been all lies. The truth is, I&#8217;m terrible at Receiving, and I know it. I didn&#8217;t want to do this Challenge, because then I&#8217;d have to examine just how bad at it I really am. That being said, I&#8217;m glad that I did investigate this Receiving thing, because I&#8217;ve learned some pretty interesting things about myself.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>Gracious Receiving </strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">This part of the Challenge required that I keep track of every possible thing that could even be remotely construed as a compliment. I&#8217;ll have you know that I don&#8217;t really enjoy getting compliments (surprise surprise), and yet I LOVE getting compliments (huh?). Let me explain. I discovered something very interesting about myself this week, I only like to be complimented for things that I <em>do,</em> not things that I <em>am.</em> For example, I was able to graciously receive any and all compliments on my cooking, knitting, artwork, various other crafts, etc. When it came to compliments concerning me (my appearance specifically), I would practically cringe. The thing is, I know that my cooking and crafting skills are phenomenal. I&#8217;ve worked hard, I practice constantly, and I&#8217;ve honed those abilities. I produce good stuff, and as a result have come to expect compliments. My appearance, on the other hand, is something I don&#8217;t really regard as something to be proud of. I just don&#8217;t believe that I&#8217;m pretty, and have become highly suspicious of anyone who tells me otherwise. I don&#8217;t accept those compliments because I think that if someone is telling me I&#8217;m pretty, they&#8217;re either crazy or having a laugh at my expense.<br />\nHow silly is that? Really, how selfish does a person have to be to deny someone else their opinion? This part of the Challenge has taught me that I have to start letting other people have their opinions, and voice them. I have come to realize that I&#8217;ve been telling myself that I&#8217;m unappealing for so long, that I forget that everyone else hasn&#8217;t been told the same thing. If they want to pay me a compliment, it&#8217;s not because they&#8217;re trying to patronize me, they probably just do like the colour of my eyes.<br />\nIt&#8217;s hard to let go of old patterns, though, and I&#8217;m still having difficulty accepting compliments of a superficial nature. You know what they say though, Fake it &#8217;til you make it, and that&#8217;s what I intend to do. I won&#8217;t modestly shake my head and say &#8220;No&#8221; every time I get a compliment, but I&#8217;ll accept that they believe it, so it must be at least partly true. Eventually my inner dialogue will make the switch too.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>Seeking Help</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">For this part of the Challenge, I&#8217;ve decided to tell you about my Bad Day. It was <em>my</em> bad day, because it was my Birthday, and it was terrible. What made it worse, is that I <em>really </em>wanted it to be good, and the more I tried, the worse it got.<br />\nThe day started out okay. The kids let me sleep in a bit, I went to a lunch seminar with an old work friend, and I even got to visit with my Dad for a bit. I was pretty excited, because my husband had planned for us all to get away for the weekend, and take the kids to the Toronto Zoo. This is where things started to go a bit sideways.<br />\nMy husband came home from work early so that we could get an early start on the drive (it&#8217;s about three hours to Toronto from where we live). Well, of course, my seminar ran late, I hadn&#8217;t packed yet (my bad), and we didn&#8217;t end up leaving until after four. No big deal, it still meant getting to the hotel a bit after seven, which meant the kids would still be in pretty good spirits, but tired enough to get them to sleep in a strange bed. No big deal (famous last words). Running late meant that we ate fast food for dinner. Well, unbeknownst to us, my Dad (who had been watching the kids while I was out) had taken the kids to McDonald&#8217;s for lunch. Apparently my oldest has a junk food threshold. He crossed it. We had to stop three times to deal with vomit situations. When he wasn&#8217;t vomiting, he was screaming. Not about anything in particular, just screaming. This, of course, triggered the competitive spirit in my youngest, because she decided to try and match and/or out scream him the whole way. In addition to this, I was so stressed out that I had a panic attack. I haven&#8217;t had one in months, so, silly me, I went off of my medication. We, of course, had to pull off the highway for that as well. So, because of all the stopping to eat, throw up, find new toys, restart DVDs, have a freak out of my own, console and anything else the kids needed\u00a0 to stop for, our little three hour car ride turned into five and a half hours from Hell.<br />\nYou&#8217;d think after all that, getting the kids to sleep would be easy. I know that five hours of screaming would have made me tired. But, nope, wrong again. I don&#8217;t know what finally worked, but they were both asleep by midnight. And just when I thought the day was over and I could just relax, BAM! F*cking cut myself while F*cking shaving. FML<br />\nThe only thing that made that day seem better, was that the return ride was twice as bad (yay for silver linings). So, my 29th birthday was a total disaster. I&#8217;m keeping my fingers crossed that 30 will be a vast improvement, it couldn&#8217;t get much worse, after all.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>Balanced Expectations</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong></strong>So here&#8217;s where I take everything I&#8217;ve learned this week and put it into practice. I&#8217;ll admit, I don&#8217;t expect much, from myself or from other people. And I always thought that was a good thing. I&#8217;ve come to realize that it&#8217;s not good when it&#8217;s not Balanced. I used to be proud of the fact that I asked nothing of the people I Loved, only that they let me Love them, but I&#8217;m starting to realize that it&#8217;s not very gratifying to Love <em>AT\u00a0</em>people. I would much rather be <em>IN </em>Love with people. In order to engage in Love, there has to be some expectations. I deserve to be treated as I treat others. I <em>deserve</em> to be Loved by the people I Love. <em></em>I can no longer convince myself that Love means giving everything I have and expecting nothing in return. Sometimes I&#8217;m not going to be what everyone has come to expect from me. Sometimes I&#8217;m not going to just listen to your sad stories. Sometimes I&#8217;m going to demand you listen to mine, even if it goes completely against the grain to do so. Sometimes I&#8217;m going to be self-absorbed, and that&#8217;s okay, because I want you to be too. The only way we can have Love, is if we Expect to Receive it. So, I&#8217;m changing my expectations. I&#8217;m no longer going to expect people to only want my Love, I&#8217;m going to expect them to return it. I may have to repeat this part of the Challenge 74 more times to make that happen, but I start today.</p>\n", "post_id": 2195, "location": false, "date": "05-22-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["happens", "different", "unique", "help", "move", "innovate", "amazing", "out", "act", "action", "believe", "come", "think", "inspire"], "text": "<p>There are many pictures of life that our eyes blink,<br />\nBut life is not the way we see, it&#8217;s just the way we think,<br />\nLife is an old bridge when you think of falling,<br />\nLife is a road when you think of walking,<br />\nLife is a river when you think of flowing,<br />\nLife is a tree when you think of &#8216;growing&#8217;.</p>\n<p>Think of yourself as a word, then life becomes your meaning,<br />\nThink of yourself as an adventurer, then life becomes your training,<br />\nThink of yourself as fate, then life becomes your time,<br />\nThink of yourself as a poem, then life becomes your rhyme.</p>\n<p>Think of love, you&#8217;ll feel it,<br />\nThink of success, you&#8217;ll achieve it,<br />\nThink of happiness, you&#8217;ll get it,<br />\nThink of positivity, you&#8217;ll have it,<br />\nThink of only good, you&#8217;ll see it,<br />\nThink of reason, you&#8217;ll understand it,<br />\nThink of answer, you&#8217;ll solve it,<br />\nThink of truth, you&#8217;ll find it,<br />\nThink of fun, you&#8217;ll enjoy it,<br />\nThink of present, you&#8217;ll live it,<a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/think.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-2202\" title=\"T\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/think.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a><br />\nThink of power, you&#8217;ll possess it,<br />\nThink of innovation, you&#8217;ll develop it,<br />\nThink of talent, you&#8217;ll nurture it,<br />\nThink of beauty, you&#8217;ll capture it,<br />\nThink of music, you&#8217;ll hear it,<br />\nThink of game, you&#8217;ll play it,<br />\nThink of the impossible, you&#8217;ll do it,<br />\nThink of GOD, you&#8217;ll believe it.</p>\n<p>We waste our energy a lot every day,<br />\nTo make our life best in every way,<br />\nBut the key to mould our life as we like,<br />\nLies deep within our brain&#8217;s powerful psyche,<br />\nTo learn in life, some interesting lessons,<br />\nJust THINK, IT REALLY HAPPENS&#8230;..!!!</p>\n<p>\u00a9<a href=\"http://varungenius.wordpress.com\">Varun K.

There is a common theme running through these forms.  While reading the previous essays in this series you will probably have noticed that all of the emotions exist in both a selfish form and grateful form.  It would seem that the opposite expression of gratitude is selfishness.</p>\n<p>When we live in selfishness we are living in either loss, fear, judgment, remorse, hate or greed.  Sometimes we are living in more than one of the negative forms of emotion.  But the common theme of all negative expressions of emotion is that they cause us to shift our focus inwards in a negative way.  When we live in loss we are selfish because we believe that we are undeserving of love.  So we push love away, assuming we will never have it.  When we live in fear we are selfish because we believe that change brings us pain.  So we lose motivation and attempt to hamper change.  When we live in judgment we are selfish because we believe that every mistake we make lowers our intrinsic value.  So we stop making decisions and allow our superiors to make them for us.  When we live in remorse we are selfish because we believe that life is unfair.  So we wallow in self-pity.  When we  live in hate we are selfish because we believe that we are justified in our hate.  So we plot against our enemies, in an attempt to bring them pain.  When we live in greed we are selfish because we believe that everything in the world &#8220;is mine&#8221;.  So we hoard resources and covet property.</p>\n<p>None of these selfish expressions of emotion lead to love.  None of them lead to happiness, either.  It seems when reading the previous essays, that the path to love is through gratitude.  If living in selfishness is pointing your focus inward in a negative way, then living in gratitude is pointing your focus outward in a positive way.  When we live in gratitude we are able to perpetuate love and cause happiness, not only in ourselves, but in everyone around us.</p>\n<p>When we live in gratitude we are living in either the spirit of receiving, hope, compassion, joy, passion or generosity.  The interesting thing about gratitude is that when we heal one aspect of emotion it tends to spread to others around us.  When we live in the spirit of receiving we are grateful because we believe that we deserve to be loved.  So we share our love with everyone in the expectation that we will receive it back.  How could those receiving our love not be grateful?  When we live in hope we are grateful because we believe that change brings nothing but possibilities.  So we actively pursue change, learning from our mistakes along the way and always moving towards our goals with a positive attitude.  How could those witnessing this not be motivated to do the same?  When we live in compassion we are grateful because we believe that we are fortunate to have the things we have.  So we offer a helping hand to those less fortunate.  How could those we reach out to not be grateful?  When we live in joy we are grateful because we believe every moment in life brings us more happiness.  So we portray ourselves as a calm, joyful soul at all times.  How could those witnessing this not be impressed?  When we live in passion we are grateful because we believe that we have truly found love.  So we submerge ourselves in our love, trying only to help it grow.  How could those around us not be convinced to do the same with their love?  When we live in generosity we are grateful because we believe that there is more than enough to go around.  So we share our excess and expect little in return.  How could those receiving our generosity not feel gratitude?</p>\n<p>Living in gratitude not only balances our emotions.  It also spreads to those around us and allows them to balance their emotions.  We are currently living in a society that it very unbalanced.  We have entered a cycle of abuse, many thousands of years ago.  Unfortunately this cycle is very selfish.  Because we see nothing but pain and suffering in the world around us we close ourselves off and shift our focus inwards in a very negative way.  This only perpetuates the cycle of abuse, however.  Because we are selfish, we never extend any true love to anyone else.  Only wounded versions of love.  In our woundedness we eventually end up wounding our loved one.  This causes them to become selfish, which in turns creates only unbalance.</p>\n<p>If we can begin to break this cycle of abuse and begin to introduce a cycle of gratitude, humanity would have a chance to balance their emotions.  The thing is, it only takes a few people to start this way of living.  Because once they have committed to living in gratitude, those around them cannot help but notice.  They will notice because no one else they know lives in this way.  You will stand out in the crowd, creating gratitude in those you have touched.  The more people that begin to act in this way, the more people they will touch with their gratitude.</p>\n<p> But someone has to start.  Someone has to be willing to break the cycle of abuse.  Selfishness only creates more selfishness.  It is time to live our lives in gratitude.  It is time begin sharing our love with everyone around us.</p>\n<p>Read Next:</p>\n<table width=\"250\" border=\"1\" bgcolor=\"#99ccff\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://alternate-economy.com/wordpress/blog/2011/12/18/security/\">Security</a>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.alternate-economy.com\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.alternate-economy.com/Images/banner-alternate-economy.jpg\" alt=\"The Alternate Economy\" width=\"450\"></a></p>\n", "post_id": 2204, "location": false, "date": "05-22-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["emotion", "alternate", "love", "cancer", "give", "age of aquarius", "gemini", "thanks", "selfishness", "alternative", "hate", "fear", "film", "astrology", "gratitude", "selfish", "story", "inheritance", "peace", "writing", "passion", "happiness", "remorse", "receiving", "hope", "economy", "compassion", "joy", "aquarius", "judgement", "protection", "security", "loss", "receive", "freedom", "foolishness", "movies", "universe", "hatred", "balance", "greed", "generosity"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/construction.jpg\"><img src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/construction.jpg?w=300&#038;h=197\" alt=\"\" title=\"CONSTRUCTION WORKERS EYEING UP LONG LEGGED GIRL AS SHE WALKS PAS\" width=\"300\" height=\"197\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2222\" /></a></p>\n<p>I am going to be honest with you: I think I am great.  I really do.  I pretend to be modest, because it seems the right thing to do.  But at the end of the day, I generally take compliments even when they are unintended.  Sometimes someone will appear to be stuttering or unsure of what to say.  I will naturally assume they are about to compliment me, so I often help them out by just complimenting myself for them.</p>\n<p>Ok, this may be a bit of an exaggeration.  I am not exactly an ego-maniac.  But I am very confident.  VERY confident in my ability to Love.  So much so, that I often forget others are not really all that confident in this area.  So I tend to come on a bit strong and make some people a little nervous.  But I am Love.  I am kind.  I am giving.  There is nothing to fear.</p>\n<p>It is funny, like Lesley, who posted just yesterday about these things, I am also mostly confident in what I can DO.  Rather than what I <em>look</em> like&#8230;  Although that is changing.  I have no worries about my abilities.  I am a great singer, skilled in math and science, a strong writer and daring revolutionary.  But when I look in the mirror, sometimes I am slightly disappointed.  But the Universe will provide, assuming you are willing to listen.  It has been a few weeks now, but during the week of Receiving, I received a rather startling compliment from a complete stranger.  I had to jot it down, since it was so unexpected and so well timed (what with the challenge going on and all).  I arrived at the farm after a long day of work.  I was still in my work clothes (as a server I wear all black, dress clothing).  Ian, the owner of the farm, saw me and shouted out that I was overdressed.  I responded that I was just getting ready to change when this beautiful young voice came out of nowhere and said &#8220;That&#8217;s too bad, you are such a little hotty pants.&#8221;  When I turned around I saw a young girl, about 20 or so, that I have never seen before, or since.  I don&#8217;t know where she came from, or who she is.  Naturally, I took the compliment in stride, as I am so good at doing and responded with &#8220;You should see me in my other clothes.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Compliments are fun.  They make me feel good.  That one little compliment from an unknown girl literally made my week.  I am still thinking about it.  Granted I don&#8217;t receive that many compliments from strangers about my appearance.  But it never hurts to know that someone out there thinks you are a hotty pants.</p>\n", "post_id": 2221, "location": false, "date": "05-22-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["gratitude", "MindMindful", "Contentment", "8 Week Challenge"], "text": "<p>How interesting it is that this post, which has been percolating to the surface for a few days, coincides so nicely with the 7th week of the <a title=\"8 Week Challenge\" href=\"http://wp.me/p21f5h-o8\">8 Week Challenge: Gratitude\u00a0</a>&#8230;&#8230;.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/imagescapj050e.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-2226\" title=\"Gratitude   www.sippiambrose.blogspot.com\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/imagescapj050e.jpg?w=270&#038;h=187\" alt=\"\" width=\"270\" height=\"187\" /></a>Sometimes, I feel utterly at peace. Content, not feeling bereft. Desirous of nothing. At these times, I feel at ease with this idea: &#8220;Everything is perfect.

Gratitude surely must be\u00a0radiating from me:), along with a feeling of existential success. At these times, I can truly see the opportunities for waking up, even when something is not going quite the way I wish it to. I am gentle, it is easier to be kind, I listen more carefully to the meta-communication of others. In &#8220;moments&#8221; like these, which actually sometimes last for days at a time, I am free of making comparisons between myself &amp; others, &amp; I can see myself &amp; others very clearly, &amp; yet compassionately. <em>I think there&#8217;s a great big set of clues right there, don&#8217;t you??</em></p>\n<p>Sometimes, though, I feel so far from What I Want, &amp; desire for What I Do Not Have is <a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/imagescacaspl3.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-2227\" title=\"&quot;Divine Premenstrual Dissatisfaction&quot;   www.cycleharmony.com\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/imagescacaspl3.jpg?w=253&#038;h=199\" alt=\"\" width=\"253\" height=\"199\" /></a>nearly overwhelming. It&#8217;s not greed, exactly, as I don&#8217;t in any way wish to deprive anyone else of What They Want. I just am very aware of what is lacking in my life, &amp; I feel so distant from ever having it. And sometimes so veryvery angry with myself for not creating the life I want, especially for feeling like I <em>cannot</em>\u00a0create what I want. At times like these, I make a point of noting gratitude &#8212; making long lists of things I&#8217;m grateful to have, &amp; not have. Eventually, my sense of bereft-ness, of not-having, will dissipate, &amp; I can move back to a more balanced perspective. At times like this, I am trying to avoid the sense of just shoving the discontent from my own sight. I am trying to not just be squashing the feelings I feel I should not indulge, but rather seeing them for what they are. As all things that arise will eventually fall away, I know that the discontent will dissolve. A little act of faith, that. Sometimes, I am successful at waiting for this. Sometimes, I am not &amp; I have the occasional little tantrum, haha. In these &#8220;moments&#8221;, which usually do not last for more than a few hours, I make copious comparisons between myself &amp; others, between what we have &amp; do &amp; look like. And I always feel <a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/imagesca0zi2l9.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-2228\" title=\"Happy chicken   www.funkyhappychickens.com\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/imagesca0zi2l9.jpg?w=197&#038;h=195\" alt=\"\" width=\"197\" height=\"195\" /></a>as if I am failing. <em>Another huge set of clues, yes??</em></p>\n<p><em>Chicken &amp; egg</em>: Gratitude feeds Contentment? or, Contentment nurtures Gratitude??

As my example of how I have assessed my expectations, I will be speaking of a recent series of events at work.</p>\n<p>As you may know, I work as a server in a restaurant.  My current job is a family owned restaurant, with a small staff of only 10 front of house staff.  The managers are the owners, with the husband in charge of the kitchen and the wife in charge of the dining room.  I have noticed that our front of house manager has been having some frustrations with people&#8217;s schedules.  These frustrations have filtered down to me.  Since I am the only server with wide open availability, it always falls on me to pick up the slack when someone needs time off at the last moment.  The owner spends only an hour or two in the restaurant a day, and this is at slow times, in order to update the wine list and do some administrative things.  I am starting to realize that because she is never there and we have such a small staff, most of whom have been there many years, that there is no real &#8220;person to go to&#8221; when there is a decision to make regarding the schedule.  So the staff just ask each other.  And since I always say &#8220;yes&#8221; it ends up being me that takes all the extra shifts.  </p>\n<p>This is good for my pocket book, but bad for my mental health.  I do not like working tons of extra shifts but I do it anyway, because I don&#8217;t want to leave the restaurant hanging, and I can really use the money towards savings, etc.  But at the same time I feel like this pattern, if continued all summer, will wear me out.</p>\n<p>So what to do?  It turns out my last job was as a manager of the front of house at a restaurant.  I was in charge of scheduling.  We had a staff of 40+ front of house that I was responsible for scheduling.  It took roughly 1 to 2 hours a week to do, once I had a system figured out.</p>\n<p>Yesterday I contacted the owner of the restaurant and asked her if she would like some help with the schedule.  I told her that I was in no way upset, but that I felt that my experience could be useful to her.  She seemed pretty happy, actually.  She thanked me for caring and agreed to meet on Thursday before my shift to discuss how we might go forwards.</p>\n<p>As it stand there is a set schedule, with nothing really posted.  If you can&#8217;t work your regular shift, it is your responsibility to change it.  I would rather work in a system where a weekly schedule is posted 2 weeks in advance.  Any requests go through the scheduler, who has access to everyone&#8217;s availability.  Since no one else is willing to make this happen in my workplace, I will do it.</p>\n<p>Balanced Expectations.  I expect to receive a certain environment at work, so I must be willing to do my part to ensure that I receive that which I desire.  In this case it is a schedule that I can count on 2 weeks in advance.  I have made schedules before, and they are not hard.  I can do it again, if it helps me to Receive.</p>\n", "post_id": 2233, "location": false, "date": "05-23-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["emotion", "alternate", "love", "cancer", "give", "age of aquarius", "gemini", "thanks", "selfishness", "alternative", "hate", "fear", "film", "astrology", "gratitude", "selfish", "story", "inheritance", "peace", "writing", "passion", "happiness", "remorse", "receiving", "hope", "economy", "compassion", "joy", "aquarius", "judgement", "protection", "security", "loss", "receive", "freedom", "foolishness", "movies", "universe", "hatred", "balance", "greed", "generosity"], "text": "<p>For my post of Joyful Anticipation, I will of course be using the farm.

Back to this moment, I do feel gratitude, for many things, &amp; I list them to myself frequently, lest I feel bereft, forlorn, missing out. Lest I seem UNgrateful</p>\n<p>So, I&#8217;m getting a week behind in the <a title=\"8 Week Challenge\" href=\"http://wp.me/p21f5h-o8\">8 Week Challenge</a>. But to that I say: <em>It matters not. </em>I&#8217;m thinking muchly, &amp; deeply on these challenges. And because this past week or so, I <em>have</em> been indulging &#8212; one might say, <em>wallowing in</em>\u00a0&#8212; other issues, my further gratitude essays are yet forthcoming. Today, the newspaper&#8217;s cryptoquote perfectly encapsulates one of the points raised in this week&#8217;s challenge though, that of being grateful for past traumas because of the compassion they&#8217;ve taught us:</p>\n<blockquote><p>You need bruises to know blessings.<a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/imagesca51yvk2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-2271\" title=\"Gentle comfort   www.howtoflourish.com\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/imagesca51yvk2.jpg?w=251&#038;h=201\" alt=\"\" width=\"251\" height=\"201\" /></a></p>\n<p><a title=\"Frances Shand Kydd\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Shand_Kydd\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">Frances Shand\u00a0Kydd</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>Ain&#8217;t that the truth! And, really &#8212; as I write this &#8212; I see that my recent delving into &#8212; one <em>might</em>\u00a0say, wallowing in &#8212; various issues &amp; character traits running through my life, has been about this very idea. Because of &#8216;flaws&#8217; that have caused me repeated, long-term troubles, I have come to be\u00a0very much kinder toward others. And veryVERY\u00a0muchMUCH more compassionate toward, &amp; patient with, the troubles other people create. Knowing I didn&#8217;t mean to create suffering, &amp; didn&#8217;t want to, but maybe because of The Way I Am just could not avoid &#8212; has made me much gentler with others. For, is it possible that they too did not mean to, or want to create trouble?? Yes, of course, for this IS how it is with much of the junk we humans generate &#8230;&#8230; often, <em>we just did not know how to </em>not<em> create it. </em>Which is the very dynamic, observed within myself &amp; within others, that has led me to my journey toward mindfulness &amp; &#8220;fixing&#8221; my own<a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/imagescas1auk6.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-2269\" title=\"Stumbling woman   www.clipartof.com\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/imagescas1auk6.jpg?w=251&#038;h=201\" alt=\"\" width=\"251\" height=\"201\" /></a> mind. It&#8217;s the only really effective first step toward altering the multiverse. And I am very glad to Be Here, because I think creating a mindful mind makes a big difference &#8212; not just for myself, but on behalf of others too. The world CAN be made better than it is; changing how our minds work is what will make it possible.</p>\n<p>And, with that, <em>in spite of myself</em>, I&#8217;ve stumbled right on into another essay for Week 7&#8217;s challenge! <em>Gratitude,</em> whew!</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.wordpress.com/2012/05/21/week-7-gratitude/\" target=\"_blank\">Week 7: Gratitude</a> (alternateeconomy.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.wordpress.com/2012/05/22/week-7-gratitude-great-big-set-of-clues/\" target=\"_blank\">Week 7: GRATITUDE &#8211; Great big set of clues</a> (alternateeconomy.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://expandyourperception.com/2012/05/25/gratitude/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gratitude</a> (expandyourperception.com)</li>\n</ul>\n", "post_id": 2266, "location": false, "date": "05-28-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["poem", "spiritual", "love", "heart", "Light", "flow", "poetry", "resistance", "personal growth"], "text": "<p>Love is quite caustic<br />\nBlessed acid of Life<br />\nBurns softly it does<br />\nBrings warmth to cold nights</p>\n<p>Love is quite caustic<br />\nIt wears gently away<br />\nWood, steel or hate<br />\nCannot stand in its way</p>\n<p>Love is quite caustic<br />\nThe Heart knows it is so<br />\nEgo structures erode<br />\nUnder its inexorable flow</p>\n<p>Love is quite caustic<br />\nOnly fools dare to mock<br />\nOpen the gates or be flooded<br />\nIt cannot be stopped</p>\n<p>Love is quite caustic<br />\nResistance by force<br />\nShall spell only your doom<br />\nBetter joyful than toast</p>\n<p>Love is quite caustic<br />\nA dark fortress?

No matter what we do or don&#8217;t do, whether we are deserving or not, irrespective of what we do or don&#8217;t desire: We. Will. Receive. Things, situations, people, ideas are flowing around &amp; through our lives all of the time, always. So, <em>why do we (meaning: I) sometimes feel so bereft?? </em>Why is there this sense of &#8220;I Do Not Have What I Want &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;<em> &#8220;??<a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/imagesca4869ay.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-2291\" title=\"Choosing   www.thinkmitchthink.com\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/imagesca4869ay.jpg?w=259&#038;h=194\" alt=\"\" width=\"259\" height=\"194\" /></a></em></p>\n<p>Speaking for myself, it is because I do not welcome what comes. I seek to <em>choose</em>, to assert a preference, which I &#8212; in my infinitesimal wisdom &#8212; thi<a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/imagescadxac4w.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-2292\" title=\"ROTFL   www.picturesof.net\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/imagescadxac4w.jpg?w=240&#038;h=194\" alt=\"\" width=\"240\" height=\"194\" /></a>nk is equal to What Is Best. I get this wrong, often! And I suspect my Inner Wise Woman is ROTFL, more often than not. In my preferring one thing over another, which takes up a lot of energy &amp; mind-time, I frequently anoint what comes as &#8220;unworthy&#8221; &amp;&#8221;unwanted&#8221;. And, so &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. <em>I struggle</em>.<em> I experience discontent</em>. Far more than is really necessary. I do not experience mindfulness at such times, as my ego is frantically asserting its hegemony over the myriad moments of life. This causes suffering minor &amp; major, &amp; it shoves me back into the past, the territory of anger &amp; dissatisfaction. Or it knocks me far into the future where anxiety &amp; fear dwell. At such times there is certainly no room for Love!</p>\n<p>It may be <a title=\"Pema Ch\u00f6dr\u00f6n\" href=\"http://pemachodron.org/\" rel=\"homepage\" target=\"_blank\">Pema\u00a0Chodron</a>, one of my very favorite Buddhist teachers, who says to <em><strong>welcome everything as if we have chosen it</strong></em>. With all the horror &amp; turmoil in the world, my first reaction to this idea: <em>WTF?!?</em>\u00a0This attitude of welcoming all that comes as if it was chosen\u00a0turns all of the preferences we have, all of the discernment we try to gain, right on their little heads. It zips right on by the the judgments of what is right, best, most worthy. And it completely obliterates Want vs Not-Want. Welcoming everything as if we&#8217;d chosen it gives us more opportunities to actually learn something, &amp; to grow, &amp; <em>to be mindful</em>. It makes it possible to experience real contentment, which means: <em>not struggling</em>.</p>\n<p>Ay, the few times in my life I&#8217;ve actually been in the midst of Contentment, I liked it! Exerting a preference to live within Contentment all of the time IS one choice worth making &#8212; but beware, for it brings about a revolution in the thinking of all of those (such as myself) who pretend we are free-thinking, independent, discerning types. Welcoming eve<a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/imagescay6cfmm.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2290 alignright\" title=\"Woman\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/imagescay6cfmm.jpg?w=230&#038;h=219\" alt=\"\" width=\"230\" height=\"219\" /></a>rything as if it were our choice means being open &amp; in humble relationship with What Is, which is counter to choosing This over That. It means flowing <em>upon</em>, rather than swimming <em>within or against</em>, the currents of life. And it requires being truly present to That Which IS, rather than being overcome with reactivity to it.</p>\n<p>Put another way, as in this post of <a href=\"http://namasteconsultinginc.com\">Namaste Consulting</a>, it is: <a title=\"'Welcome Everything, Push Away Nothing'\" href=\"http://namasteconsultinginc.com/2012/06/03/welcome-everything-push-away-nothing/#comment-1704\">&#8220;welcome everything, push away nothing&#8221;</a>. ((This is first in a series on the 5 principles or teachings of Frank Ostaseski, co-founder of the Zen Hospice Project &amp; founder of the Metta\u00a0Institute.)) These teaching principles were developed in his work with the dying &amp; their care-givers, but they apply to all things, everyday. To <em><strong>welcome everything, &amp; push away nothing</strong></em> is developing a non-judgmental attitude toward things. That is, abandoning our constant habit of defining our preferences, which gets in the way of <em>simply being</em>. Buddhist dharma teaches us to avoid grasping, yes, &amp; likewise to avoid aversion &#8212;&gt;&gt; accepting What Is. In practical terms, it means to not rail against whatever comes in our lives, because it is Something We Do Not Want. Afterall, in the vastness of the universe, in the complexities of living, &amp; within the bazillions of things that are occurring all of the time: How can anyone of us possible know what really is best?!?

While I like the whole breakdown for this Challenge, I&#8217;ve decided that I&#8217;m going to go another way here and do my own thing. Joyful Anticipation and Joyful Excitement, for me anyway, go hand in hand. Anyone who knows me knows that I get super excited about even the smallest things, and will absolutely shiver with anticipation (<em>five points to the first person who gets that reference</em>) about any upcoming event. For example, I&#8217;ve got a big trip this summer to visit a friend of mine who I haven&#8217;t seen in over a decade. This trip has been in the works\u00a0 for a few months now, and is still two months away. Some people might get fed up with the waiting, but it&#8217;s just given me more time to build the anticipation. I think I&#8217;ve planned more things to do than could possibly fit into a weekend, but I&#8217;m just so excited to see my friend. The very thought of him brings me Joy, so I could be nothing but Joyous while planning this trip. I feel like a kid going to Disney World for the first time. Even if this trip were a year away I&#8217;d still be filled with anticipation and excitement.<br />\nJoy actually comes pretty easy to me, that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s taken me so long to write this post. I don&#8217;t really know how to talk about something that seems so effortless. I find Joy everywhere. That&#8217;s not to say that I don&#8217;t feel sorrow or regret, or even trepidation at times. I&#8217;m human, I feel all those negative emotions and more. The difference for me is that I don&#8217;t dwell on them. Joy is available for everyone, if they could only relax for a while and just let it happen. Even in what seems like the most dreary of lives, there is always Joy to be had. You know first thing in the morning, when your feeling all fuzzy from sleep, you still have crusties in your eyes and you get that long, perfect stretch? That&#8217;s Joy. You know how after a long day, where everyone was just riding your ass, you&#8217;re completely stressed and you finally get to sit down? That&#8217;s Joy. Or how about stepping into a steaming hot shower, feeling the hot water prickling at your skin and melting the day&#8217;s stresses away, pooling them at your feet and then washing down the drain. That&#8217;s Joy. These are the moments that can&#8217;t be taken from you.<br />\nEven if you&#8217;re unsatisfied in your job, aren&#8217;t happy with your romantic life,\u00a0 or hate your house, there are always the little Joys that creep up on you. That&#8217;s the thing about Joy, you can&#8217;t find it; it finds you. You&#8217;re not going to be able to find it on some treasure hunt, it&#8217;s not hidden under a rock, it&#8217;s not in the heart of another person, it just <em>is.</em> And once you do discover that it&#8217;s all around you, it&#8217;s free for the &#8220;taking&#8221; and it&#8217;s available to everyone, you&#8217;ll never be without Joy again. It&#8217;s really just a matter of choice. Do you choose to dwell on the remorseful aspects of life, or do you look forward to the Joyous? You could curse and swear and complain to everyone\u00a0 around you if you stub your toe, or you could sigh with relief when you put an ice pack on it. You could stress out and be full of worry after losing a job, or you could appreciate the experience gained and look forward to new opportunities. You could mourn the loss of a relationship for an eternity, or you could be thankful for the growing experience it provided and look forward to connecting with new people knowing that you&#8217;ll be a better Lover for all that you&#8217;ve learned.<br />\nIt&#8217;s all about accepting the life you&#8217;ve chosen for yourself and knowing that every action you&#8217;ve taken and every action taken against (or for) you has a purpose. When I&#8217;m upset because my life hasn&#8217;t turned out how I thought it would,\u00a0 or I get frustrated with my body image, or any number of other things that piss me off, I remind myself that before I was even born, I, in my infinite wisdom, chose this life. I mapped my course, I placed my obstacles, planned my life lessons and plotted the mistakes I would make. And I looked forward to these experiences with great anticipation. There are days when I have to remind myself of this several times.<br />\nI know that I&#8217;ve chosen my life, and I know that I wouldn&#8217;t have chosen something I couldn&#8217;t handle. So now I choose to be content and Joyful.</p>\n", "post_id": 2300, "location": false, "date": "06-05-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["emotion", "alternate", "love", "cancer", "give", "age of aquarius", "gemini", "thanks", "selfishness", "alternative", "hate", "fear", "film", "astrology", "gratitude", "selfish", "story", "inheritance", "peace", "writing", "passion", "happiness", "remorse", "receiving", "hope", "economy", "compassion", "joy", "aquarius", "judgement", "protection", "security", "loss", "receive", "freedom", "foolishness", "movies", "universe", "hatred", "balance", "greed", "generosity"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/3338585413_1b3c67a128.jpg\"><img src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/3338585413_1b3c67a128.jpg?w=199&#038;h=300\" alt=\"\" title=\"3338585413_1b3c67a128\" width=\"199\" height=\"300\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2304\" /></a></p>\n<p>In our world today, communication is key to success in all things.  It may not be obvious at first, but I assure you, without communication life loses all meaning.  The funny thing about communication is that we are engaging in it constantly, even sometimes without knowing.  Yet there are very few people today that are masters of communication.  It is, in fact, rather difficult to master communication.  When you consider that every facial expression, every eye movement, every shift in pitch and tone while speaking, every hand gesture and every detail of your posture is a form of communication it starts to become more clear how important this skill is in our lives.  Even silence is a powerful tool for communication.  Timing, accenting certain words, leaving out certain words, laughter, tears.  All of it communication.</p>\n<p>But why is communication so important to life and Love?  Communication is most literally sharing.  It is the sharing of an idea, an opinion or a feeling.  Now let us consider quickly what it means to have a personality.  What is it that makes us feel unique?  What do we base our personality upon?  It seems to me that our personality is composed of our ideas, opinions and feelings.  These three aspects are what define us as&#8230; us.  Without our ideas, opinions and feelings we are truly nothing.  And this is why communication is so important.  Communication allows us to express ourselves and truly live our personality.  But this is also an opportunity for confusion to enter.  If communication is nothing more than sharing our ideas, opinions and feelings then why is it so few people are masters of communication?</p>\n<p>In our world today there is an overwhelming sense of competition between humans.  In competition it is wise to withhold information from your competitor, in order to maintain an edge.  Withholding information is actually rather difficult.  It does not come naturally.  Through our facial expressions and eye movements alone we generally betray almost all of our opinions and feelings.  Unless of course we practice deception.  Unless we teach ourselves to lie.  If we can learn to restrain our reactions in certain situations where we do not trust the other person completely, then we can keep them guessing as to our true intentions.</p>\n<p>This has become incredibly important in our world of suffering.  It is cyclical however, and is caused by an overall lack of trust.  And the end result may not be quite what you expect.  We learn to mask our emotion at a young age, through the judgments received by those who came before us.  Those who are already wounded.  In time we come to realize that when we express our feelings and opinions and ideas honestly we are faced with judgment, rejection and pain.  So we stop doing so.  We become masters of un-communication.  But in order to truly mask our communication, we must not only control the words we use.  We must also control our facial expressions.  We must control our eyes and our hands.  But in order to do this, we must literally change our thought patterns.  We must lie to ourselves about our feelings.  It is the only way to effectively mask yourself.  Otherwise some truth may slip out.  If we acknowledge our ideas, opinions and feelings then some evidence of it will appear in our overall demeanor.  And a perceptive person will pick up on it.  And we know that.  So we don&#8217;t acknowledge the idea.  We don&#8217;t acknowledge the opinion.  We don&#8217;t acknowledge the feeling.  And we are safe from judgment.  Safe from rejection.  Safe from the pain.</p>\n<p>But we are living a lie.  By refusing to acknowledge how we truly feel in a given situation, we instead choose to act &#8220;as expected&#8221;.  But this category of &#8220;as expected&#8221; varies as widely as the person describing it.  The funny thing about &#8220;as expected&#8221; is that it is simply a compilation of the judgments that you have received previously.  As we lie to ourselves about our true feelings, we instead adopt the feelings of those around us.  Those around us have done the same, adopting their feelings from wounded individuals that have judged them.  A cycle of un-communication and a recipe for disaster.  There is no room for Love in this scenario.  When we adopt our ideas, opinions and feelings from those around us, for fear that our true feelings will betray us, we lose our personality.  We lose what makes us unique.  That which makes us special.  When we lie to ourselves in order to mask our intentions we begin to lose sight of our original goals.  Our new goal is to avoid suffering, and it takes precedence over all others.  The more we withhold information for fear of rejection and isolation, the more we lose our sense of self.  The less we communicate, the less we are able to experience Love.</p>\n<p>So what is to be done?  How do we avoid this cycle of un-communication?</p>\n<p>Honesty.</p>\n<p>Impeccable honesty.  There is no other way.  Allow yourself to have ideas.  Allow yourself to have opinions.  Allow yourself to have feelings.  And then share them.  Share them with everyone you meet.  Make eye contact with the people you want to make eye contact with.  Smile.  Laugh.  Ask questions if you don&#8217;t understand.  Make mistakes.  Say stupid things.  Apologize a lot.  Mean it when you apologize.  Realize you aren&#8217;t perfect.  But say what you are thinking anyway.  Just share.  Share with your eyes, your hands, your face and your voice.  Share all that you are and all that you could be.  There is really no other way.</p>\n<p>And soon enough you will come to a realization.  Ideas can&#8217;t be wrong, only strange.  Opinions can&#8217;t be wrong either, only misinformed.  And feelings can most certainly never be wrong, only brutally honest.  If you can never be wrong, then what is there to hide?</p>\n<p>Communication is key to Love, and all things for that matter, because it is the key to our understanding of ourselves.  If we cannot allow ourselves to communicate honestly at all times, then we are hiding something not just from others, but from our self as well.  Love relies on honesty and true sharing.  Love is communication.  They are not different things.  If we can master one, we have mastered the other.</p>\n", "post_id": 2303, "location": false, "date": "06-06-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Earth changes", "love", "Light", "poetry", "paradigm shift", "common", "shift", "Eart", "Earth", "choice", "beginning", "dream", "change"], "text": "<p><strong>We stand on the threshold</strong></p>\n<p>Of a Light-filled New Day</p>\n<p>Many souls still debate, though:</p>\n<p>\u2018Can I go?\u2019, \u2018Should I stay?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The common Dream we\u2019ve been weaving</p>\n<p>Has run its due course</p>\n<p>Our illusions no longer</p>\n<p>Can be fed, given force</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It went a bit far</p>\n<p>Our adventure in time</p>\n<p>We plumbed the dark depths</p>\n<p>And had pleasures sublime</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But it\u2019s time to move on now</p>\n<p>Get back to our Homes</p>\n<p>Rejoin forgotten brethren</p>\n<p>And with them galaxies roam!</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s make up our minds, folks</p>\n<p>And get on with the task</p>\n<p>Of releasing our bindings</p>\n<p>Removing our masks</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As many that can</p>\n<p>Need to get the Good Word</p>\n<p>Of this time of decisions &#8211;</p>\n<p>The Call must be heard!</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So tell all your friends</p>\n<p>Your family, your boss</p>\n<p><em>Our liberation is here!</em></p>\n<p>Well, once we clean out the dross . . . .</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shed your fears, claim your Power!</p>\n<p>The Divine Muse does us court</p>\n<p>And with love try to help</p>\n<p>Those who falter; lend support</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>No, not all choose to answer</p>\n<p>The Call, and that\u2018s fine</p>\n<p>They shall again have a chance</p>\n<p>Far away in space/time</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Our success is assured</p>\n<p>Whether today or in future</p>\n<p>But for me it\u2019s RIGHT NOW!</p>\n<p>I\u2019m <em>quite</em> done with the horror</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Of living a lie</p>\n<p>Apart from our Source</p>\n<p>My bonds reestablished</p>\n<p>I\u2019m strapped in, and on course . . . .</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>\u2018Take your protein pills and put your helmet on . . . . .\u2019</em></p>\n", "post_id": 2315, "location": false, "date": "06-07-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Right Speech", "Sai Baba", "Dharma", "MindMindful", "Buddha", "Noble Eightfold Path", "8 Week Challenge"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/imagescaj4r0k6.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-2326\" title=\"Blah blah blah   www.creaturesinmyhead.com\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/imagescaj4r0k6.jpg?w=225&#038;h=225\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"225\" /></a>For the final of the <a title=\"8 Week Challenge\" href=\"http://wp.me/p21f5h-o8\">8 Week Challenge</a>, I had a long screed written, but upon re-reading it the next day, I realized it is just indulgent blah blah.

Seen in this manner, many of the common forms of communication might suddenly be viewed quite differently. A helpful set of &#8216;guidelines&#8217;, which I first came across as attributed to Sai Baba, are these:</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Is it kind?<a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/images.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-2323\" title=\"Right speech   www.dhammawheel.com\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/images.jpg?w=185&#038;h=240\" alt=\"\" width=\"185\" height=\"240\" /></a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Think: Gossip.

Trying to always have the last word. Bragging. Meaning to shock others. Self-indulgent blah blah.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Is it true?</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Obvious, right? Lying. Misrepresenting. Tearing down your opponent. Demonizing &#8216;the other&#8217;.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Does it improve upon the silence?</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>There are times when it&#8217;s not possible to be better than simply silent: Being &#8216;present&#8217; to someone dying, or in pain. Holding someone&#8217;s confidence. Refraining when in emotional turmoil. Not rising to the bait.

What is listening? It is one thing to hear what someone says to you, but it is quite another to listen to it.</p>\n<p>Listening implies that we take what someone has said and we begin to digest it. We analyze the various layers that the idea presented to us contains. We look to the person saying the things and to what we know about them. We use our knowledge about their situation and their past to try and gain a better idea of their perspective. We use our knowledge about the person not to create assumptions, but rather to strip them away. As we uncover the other\u2019s perspective, we begin to see how they have reached their conclusion. Now we can begin to analyze the statement. We are free of assumptions and have arrived at the problem from a new-found perspective. Now you can weigh this perspective against your own.</p>\n<p>The funny thing about truly listening is that we find that neither perspective is truly wrong. It is simply that, a perspective. When we slip into the other\u2019s shoes and truly listen to what they are saying and where they are saying it from, we can see their point.</p>\n<p>Now the tricky part. When we truly listen, we see that every problem has many sides and many perspectives. But only one Truth. The Truth is that our Universe is a spectacular place filled with infinite perspectives, all of which are valid. The Truth is that Balance arrives from investigating every problem from every perspective. When we are able to do this, we see that the answer is never in the extreme. The answer lies in the middle. No one side of the problem is right, no one perspective superior. The answer is always found somewhere in the middle.</p>\n<p>I am curious, what does purple look like to you? Does it look the same to you as it does to me? Probably not. But is my version of purple more accurate than yours? Can it even be described? Purple is simply a perspective. So is religion. And philosophy. And spiritualism. And suffering. And joy. I will not help you to find Joy by telling you what it is. I will help you find Joy by listening to what you think it is.</p>\n<p>I am ready to listen. But remember, I have a perspective too. And I will not be easily swayed by extremes. I will try to meet you somewhere in the middle.

Not in the mirror, not in your reflection, not in your shadow; but in this space\u2026.directly! Observe yourself, harder. What do you see? Who are you? Or it would be better to ask \u2018what are you?\u2019 I have thought over it many times and each time ended up going deeper and deeper into a spiral, but with no end. But now it seems that I have something to come forward with, which can keep me satisfied until the next phase of doubt jumps in. If you look at yourself and go deep inside you layer by layer, you\u2019ll end up on the fundamental unit of life called \u2018cell\u2019. Now if you go a little deeper, you\u2019ll stop at the basic fundamental and smallest unit of which all the matter is composed of; and that basic fundamental unit is \u2018atom\u2019.<a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/atomvector.gif\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-2361 alignright\" title=\"atomvector\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/atomvector.gif?w=300&#038;h=163\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"163\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Let\u2019s go a little deeper into atom, we find electrons revolving around a heavy nucleus which itself contains protons and neutrons. Now, the final and most thoughtful question, \u201cWhat is an electron or proton or neutron?\u201d or in simple terms \u201cWhat is matter?\u201d We all are aware of the basic definition of matter and are convinced with it as far as answering to someone is concerned. But if we are really convinced, then why does the same question keep on whispering in our mind. That means there must be something that has yet to be known about matter.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">This is what I realized and I\u2019m going to share it right away. <strong><em>Matter\u2026\u2026doesn\u2019t exist; it appears to exist!</em></strong> I realized this truth about matter (I believe it is!) not by thinking deep but by thinking general. I observed everything around, and then tried to relate them by something that can be generalized, or that is fundamental. <a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/39-everything-energy.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-2362\" title=\"39-everything-energy\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/39-everything-energy.jpg?w=300&#038;h=211\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"211\" /></a>Atom did not satisfy me much and so I decided to leap into it to the level of a speck of nothingness. But I found something very interesting there and surprisingly it was so fundamental that everything seemed connected somehow! I found <strong>energy</strong>. Yes! Everything around us is made up of energy, not matter. Matter is a highly condensed form of energy; energy that always exists around and within us. Through meditation, I realized that whatever we may look like outside, we all are pulses of waves inside; waves oscillating at some frequencies. These are the frequencies connecting us to everything around us by resonating with some and interfering with some others. Our likes, interests, talents, passion, skills, behaviour, etc. are all the result of either the interference or resonance of these frequencies we generate within us. When we are sad or disappointed, interference occurs (destructive of course!) and when we are happy, resonance occurs or maybe constructive interference. Within each of us, there lies a speck of nothingness but our consciousness fills this \u2018nothingness\u2019 with \u2018oneness\u2019. The ONE from where we came and where we\u2019ll end!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">All this I realized myself through meditation and deep general thinking (you can call it so!). And <a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/meditation.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright  wp-image-2363\" title=\"meditation\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/meditation.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>as it was expected (it was surprizing though!!), quantum physics agrees to this fact.\u00a0I read some articles after realizing this fact just to check if any theory supports this realization of mine so that I can rest my questioning mind for a while. And there it was, THE SUPERSTRING THEORY. You can read about this theory on the internet, it\u2019s very popular theory that strongly supports my realization. But that doesn\u2019t matter! Even if some scientific theory doesn\u2019t support my realization, it will still be a realization which I live and believe on!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>So, remember YOU ARE NOTHING BUT A FREQUENCY. You can tune yourself at any frequency you wish to; you just need to know which frequencies are good and which are not. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0</strong>\u00a9<a href=\"http://varungenius.wordpress.com\">Varun K.

It is the starting point for all of reality, as we are able to perceive it.  All things in the realm of consciousness must originate with an Idea.  Idea is not quite like imagining.  When we imagine we take an Idea and expand upon it in fantastical ways.  But we must still first have an Idea from which to begin our imaginings.  Idea is not exactly thought, either.  A thought is a contemplation, a reaction or a response to something presented.  For there to be thought there must be elaboration, depth and even style.  But what are we giving depth to, what are we elaborating upon?  The original thing presented is of course, the Idea.  The thought defines the Idea, categorizes it and evaluates it.

What can it teach you? How can it inspire you? Can you make a whole story out of a single \u2018dot\u2019? One day while talking to a friend and sending her some dots in the chat (it was just an expression), I was suddenly struck by an idea \u2013 why not write something about these dots! </em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Suppose that a \u2018dot\u2019 represents your single thought. And as you know that I strongly believe that \u201c<strong><em>we are what we believe ourselves to be. Our thoughts shape our reality\u201d</em></strong>. So, this clearly means that what we think, that we become. I\u2019ll explain this using these \u2018dots\u2019. Now, if a thought represents a dot, then if dots combine together, they make a line or curve. That means thoughts put together in a sequence create an idea (represented by a line or curve). Now, these lines combine together to form a plane or area. This area represents your belief. Many planes combine together to form a 3D shape. This 3D shape represents your perception. All these perceptions together frame your reality. Let me make it a little simpler:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/dots.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2376\" title=\"dots\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/dots.jpg?w=721&#038;h=150\" alt=\"\" width=\"721\" height=\"150\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Dots (individual thoughts) combine to form a line (idea); lines (many ideas) combine to form a plane (a single belief); planes (belief system) combine to form a 3D object (perception). And all these perceptions frame reality! Think about it\u2026..but no need to think deeper, it\u2019s simple enough to grasp.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">When you think about something, you generate thoughts and you are continuously emitting them in the form of electromagnetic waves. Inside your mind, these thoughts combine to form an idea. For an idea to shape reality, it needs to be multi-dimensional. Various ideas collide, interfere, interact, combine, diminish and in the end, the net result is a belief. This belief is the result of interaction of these various ideas. Now, a belief is something that is strong enough to take hold of you and it does not leave you so easily. Now, based on various types of your beliefs, you frame your perception. That means, you perceive what you believe. And perception can be said to be 3 dimensional, since the things with which we interact in this world, are mostly 3 dimensional. Now, with all your perceptions, you frame your reality; the reality you live in! And this reality is multi-dimensional. It is made of many beliefs that you created with your ideas. And it all started with a single tiny little \u2018dot\u2019 or I would say, a single shapeless \u2018thought\u2019.</p>\n<p>Remember, in my previous post <a href=\"http://varungenius.wordpress.com/2012/06/13/you-are-nothing-but-a-frequency/\">YOU ARE NOTHING BUT A FREQUENCY</a>, I told that everything is energy and matter doesn\u2019t exist. This dot is also matter; it doesn\u2019t exist, it just appears to exist. Actually, it is condensed energy and the thoughts released from your mind are electromagnetic waves. So, this dot and everything that is made of it (reality too) is energy which has some frequency whose magnitude depends on you!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">So now, I can say that <strong><em><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">\u2018thoughts shape reality\u2019</span></em></strong>. If a dot represents a thought, then it depends on you how to arrange these various dots to frame your ideas, then beliefs, then perception and thus \u2018your\u2019 reality. The only need is to control these dots and not let these dots control you by themselves moving to shapes you don\u2019t wish for!<em><strong> </strong></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><em><strong>Learn to control your thoughts (by meditation, yoga, physical exercise, being positive, smiling, loving or by whatever means you feel happy) so that you are the architect of your own life and there\u2019s no one to blame or complain!</strong></em></p>\n<p>\u00a9Varun K.

Of all those stories, there\u2019s one that\u2019s common to all, a story connected to rain. Rain, according to me, is one of the most beautiful elements of nature. I see rain to be so amazing that I believe everyone has some memorable story connected to it. I love rain so much that I can watch it rain for hours, admire it, dance with it. I see rain as a melody, music, a composition of GOD\u2019s own words. I remember one of my poems that I composed back in January this year. Inspired by the beauty of rain and influenced by the melodious rhythm of its chatter, I composed a poem that I would like to share with you:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">THE MELODIOUS RAIN</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>\u201cEverytime I gaze upon this endless sphere,<a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/love-rain.png\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-2385\" title=\"love rain\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/love-rain.png?w=336&#038;h=465\" alt=\"\" width=\"336\" height=\"465\" /></a></em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>I see this white dust floating in the air,</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Innocent at face they smile in sunlight,</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>But when the brothers meet, they make the day night,</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>A black sea over my head floating up high,</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Then dropping the watery moments of joy,</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Chitter chatter splitter splatter,</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Every tiny sound opens a fresh chapter,</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Cold breeze buzzing in my ear,</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>With streamline songs so melodious to hear,</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Nourishing the green with vanishing pain,</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Growing the weed into an edible grain,</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Fooled by glass in the window pane,</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Making me sigh, the melodious rain.</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>\u00a0</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>The waves of words coming time to time,</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Writing a poem with beautiful rhyme,</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Singing a chorus of GOD&#8217;s own voice,</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Sweeping the dust with elemental rejoice,</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Filling the drains that are already full,</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Draining the minds against the pull,</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Little angels from sky to tell a tale,</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>With voice even sweeter than a nightingale,</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Same but different, different but same,</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Each splatter yells out a different name,</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>One yet many, many yet one,</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>They never fear even the Sun,</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Fall and inspire, they rise again,</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Teaches me LOVE, the melodious rain&#8230;.!!!\u201d</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">This poem must have triggered a memory in many of you, but let me tell you how I feel the rain. Rain, to me, is not just drops of joy, or melodious sounds that give pleasure to my mind; but it\u2019s more a person to me; a person, who speaks through his tears, smiles through our faces, walks through natural channels of soil, plays with us holding our hands with his watery fingers.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">For the ones in LOVE, rain sings the songs of love for them and connects them through a memory that remains forever in their hearts. Romance is what pours out in rain, joy is what spreads out in its fragrance, LOVE is what can be felt in its freshness and threads of strong bonds can be clearly seen between the sky and the earth.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">A quote for those who want to see the rain differently, from the eyes of LOVE:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong><em>\u201cIt is not the freshness of rain or sounds of its chatter that inspires us much, it\u2019s actually the \u2018way it falls\u2019 that inspires the most\u2026.!

What comes in your mind when you hear this word? Does this instantly tells you that you belong to Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Jainism, Sikhism or any other human made category? Have you ever questioned your religion or your religious beliefs or you find it sinful or wrong to do so? Have you ever tried to reason your beliefs in religion or do you blindly follow the texts? The motive behind writing such questions means so disrespect for any religion. I\u2019m not questioning the validity or invalidity of any religion nor am I criticizing the beliefs about different religions created so far. My main concern here is to introduce a new concept of religion which came in my mind after meditation. The idea I\u2019m going to project here should be understood with open mind. This idea is not taken from some internet source or any book of philosophy or religion; it comes directly from the depths of my mind where my conscious SELF resides &#8211; awakened and enlightened. There\u2019s no point in agreeing or contradicting to it; it\u2019s just an idea of my mind which I believe to be correct and valid for me.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">At some point of your life, most of you might have questioned GOD or to yourself about your existence in this world. There may be times when you were stuck in any serious problem without having any idea about how to get out! You may have tried many things; you may have questioned many people; you may have questioned even yourself that why is this happening! I did that too but fortunately found an excellent medium for answering all my questions that were so long unanswered. I trusted my inner conscious SELF and believed IT to be my guide in everything I do, everything I think of doing. I made meditation as my skill of solving the problems of my own life and of others too. I created my own RELIGION\u2026!!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Religion, according to me, is a set of beliefs that guides you how to live your life happily and peacefully with joy and satisfaction for SELF and others. Anything that tells you the most efficient way of living is RELIGION. I believe that we create our own religion. Each one of us has different set of beliefs for the things we interact with and the things we experience, in this world. These set of beliefs together form belief systems. And these belief systems together form a RELIGION. Since, each one of us has different set of beliefs, this means we all have different belief systems and thus we all have our own unique RELIGION. Let\u2019s take this idea one step further by looking at the beginning, where it all started.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Right from our birth, we are taught by our parents and elders, about the existence of the ultimate energy, GOD. We begin to believe in his existence and thus for us HE actually exists! We even feel HIS presence at times when we need HIM the most. Then, as we grow up, we are taught about our religious texts and religious stories and we are told to believe that everything that our religious texts depict must be followed strictly in order to sustain a happy and satisfied life. No doubt, it\u2019s good to do so and may be beneficial too but if you go a step further with your open mind and try to see the intricate details about the various religions created so far, you\u2019ll find many common facts. Even harder observations may let you finally conclude that all the religions known so far are not separate but ONE. There may be different names and slightly different storylines but all teach and preach the same thing. It may seem as if we all are separated by different boundaries of religious beliefs, but we are actually not! All these religions seem to be converging at a single point \u2013 a point I call ONENESS. All the religions ultimately teach us ONENESS. It is my belief that what our religious texts teach us must be believed only when we realize it within ourselves.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/coexist.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-2409\" title=\"coexist\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/coexist.jpg?w=288&#038;h=288\" alt=\"\" width=\"288\" height=\"288\" /></a>What do you think, then, was the need for defining separate religions although they all teach the same thing? Human has always been curious and ignorant at the same time. We know things but in this \u2018unreal\u2019 life that we have created so far, we become ignorant. We are aware of everything but we are not awakened. We take everything for granted and live our life with \u2018let it be\u2019 attitude. So, in order to show proper path to the ignorant humans, religions were formed. These religions were shaped in such a way that these were linked directly to human lives and their betterment. Since, there were different humans with different belief systems, therefore, different religions were framed so that no contradiction comes from any side and realization comes from within. Religious stories telling us about our GODS and their way of life inspired us and taught us many lessons that would not have been easy if one person taught another person; although many great and highly awakened persons were born who devoted their lives spreading the message of ONENESS. So, religion was created as a tool or an aid to help the ones who are lost in the \u2018fake realities\u2019 of this world. Even today, if a person seems to be distracted or deviated from the normal cycle of life, then it is religion that sparkles light in his dark closed eyes and shows him way. If you ask a spiritual person about religion, you will hear him saying that he does not believe in separation of religions but he believes all of them to be ONE. A person, who is spiritually awakened and enlightened, believes in ONE religion only \u2013 a religion that he creates himself from his own belief systems and not from the religious texts and stories. The various religious texts and stories inspire us, guide us, teach us and make us learn the things we knew already but never noticed before. Exactly same happens when we are awakened and when we make our own religion.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Now the question comes, why is there a need to define your own religion although religions already exist, why not follow them instead? The reason why we should rely on our self-created religion lies in the fact that the religion that we frame ourselves is formed by relating together our own belief systems, which are more reliable with lesser contradictions and lesser self-conflicts. But how to judge whether our belief systems are valid or invalid? Well, in order to check the validity of your belief systems, you don\u2019t have to search anywhere. In my view, if you do something that you truly believe is right, it\u2019s perfectly right! Because being right or wrong is perspective dependent. If something that you do seems right to your perspective, then it is absolutely right! Belief is the key to open all the doors of your conscious and to allow the light of knowledge enlighten you!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/we-are-one-spirituality-and-religion-16797134-1024-768.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-2410\" title=\"WE-ARE-ONE-spirituality-and-religion-16797134-1024-768\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/we-are-one-spirituality-and-religion-16797134-1024-768.jpg?w=815&#038;h=611\" alt=\"\" width=\"815\" height=\"611\" /></a><em><strong>So, here I conclude that religion is anything that teaches you the way to live efficiently; and if you frame your own beliefs by going deep inside you, rather than searching outside in the texts and stories, then you create your own religion. And in such religion, you\u2019ll have no doubts, no questions, no contradictions\u2026\u2026.just answers. Just take a deep insight of yourself and with positive vision, bring out your beliefs from your absolute world to your real world\u2026..I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find the answers!!!</strong></em></p>\n<p>\u00a9<a href=\"http://varungenius.wordpress.com\">Varun K.

Questions arise, out of curiosity that keep us indulged in looking for satisfactory answers. But due to lack of time, we skip looking for answers till the end. We leave the questions unanswered thinking that finding answers don\u2019t really matter to us at all. But it matters a lot\u2026\u2026.really it does! There are instances when we say, \u201c<strong><em>I left it because that could not be explained</em></strong>\u2026..or <strong><em>I was unable to find a satisfactory explanation, that\u2019s why I left it so that I can save my time not thinking about it worthlessly</em></strong>.\u201d Questions left unanswered haunt us later; they can never be skipped, they can never be ignored. There\u2019s one thing that is true and must be known as a fact, <strong>EVERYTHING CAN BE EXPLAINED!</strong> There\u2019s nothing that is inexplicable; there\u2019s a reason for everything and every reason is self-explanatory. Reasons need not be explained, because \u2018reason is explanation\u2019. When we explain something, we give reasons that support the statement to be explained. So,</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><strong>Reason(s) = Explanation</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Logically speaking, another statement that supports this fact is <strong>THERE\u2019S A REASON FOR EVERYTHING! </strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Let\u2019s go a bit more logical! Consider the following two statements:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">a) THERE\u2019S A REASON FOR EVERYTHING</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">b) REASON IS EXPLANATION</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Therefore, EVERYTHING IS EXPLICABLE or EVERYTHING CAN BE EXPLAINED</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Since the statements (a) and (b) are true, therefore, the conclusion which is deduced from the statements must also be true. Thus, the above argument is <em>valid</em>. But this was the logical explanation; not many of you will be interested in the logical explanation of such a statement. So, here\u2019s another explanation to the topic.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Every question comes packed with many answers. A question never comes alone. Everything exists in pairs, so does the <em>question and answer</em>, problem and solution, positive and negative, and many more. In fact, I believe that <strong>the question itself is the answer! </strong>When we look from one direction, we see the question, and when we look it from the other side, we see the answer. It\u2019s just the perspective that changes and the question seems to be the answer in just a flick of direction and shift in perception. It\u2019s more like a 3D hologram that shows different images when seen from different angles. Questions can emerge out of anything, be it religion, education, research, culture, language, business, personal life, tradition, talent, adventure, idea, innovation, invention, technology, science, beliefs, and so on! Don\u2019t hesitate to ask, and don\u2019t hesitate to answer too.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Remember, EVERYTHING CAN BE EXPLAINED! You just have to give it a try, and you\u2019ll observe that all the mysteries of your life that once were complicated to unveil will be uncovered by themselves. It\u2019s like a chain; you solve one, you solve many! I have also tried to explain LOVE through a series of poems under the title <em><a href=\"http://varungenius.wordpress.com/category/love-the-unexplained-series/\">\u201cLOVE \u2013 The Unexplained\u201d</a></em>. Here, \u2018<strong><em>The Unexplained\u2019</em></strong> written in the title actually represents an irony; it actually means the opposite. Although LOVE can\u2019t be explained but still I have tried to explain it in my own way, in the way I see it. Like that, the thing(s) that you think is (are) complicated can also be explained in any understandable form. You just need some valid reasons because reasons mean explanation. You can\u2019t explain something without reasons, you simply can\u2019t! And if you do, then that is not a true explanation.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">In life, there may come many instances where you have to give explanation for your actions (positive or negative). Then you can\u2019t say that you don\u2019t really have an explanation; actually you do, but you are not courageous enough to say it because you fear of losing your identity. But remember, if things are explained as they come, then it will never risk you with anything because explanation brings misunderstandings to lower level. Misunderstandings are eliminated when there\u2019s a valid explanation to its cause. So, be ready to have a valid explanation for anything that comes your way, because there\u2019s nothing that can\u2019t be explained.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong><em>\u201cIf you can explain even a single word out of whole conversation, then it\u2019s more than sufficient to save a relation from being shattered\u2026!\u201d</em></strong></p>\n<p>\u00a9<a href=\"http://varungenius.wordpress.com\">Varun K.

I am part of that movement. You can watch the film online or you can request a copy from me if you write to at </strong><br />\n<strong>angelman24@sprintmail.com </strong><br />\n<strong>This poll is both for those that are familiar and unfamiliar with the film and its concepts. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>The movement: </strong><br />\n<strong>We intend to restore the fundamental necessities and environmental awareness of the species through the avocation of the most current understandings of who and what we truly are, coupled with how science, nature and technology (rather than religion, politics and money) hold the keys to our personal growth, not only as individual human beings, but as a civilization, both structurally and spiritually. The central insights of this awareness is the recognition of the Emergent and Symbiotic elements of natural law and how aligning with these understandings as the bedrock of our personal and social institutions, life on earth can and will flourish into a system which will continuously grow in a positive way, where negative social consequences, such as social stratification, war, biases, elitism and criminal activity will be constantly reduced and, idealistically, eventually become nonexistent within the spectrum of human behavior itself. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>This possibility is, of course, very difficult for most humans to consider, for we have been conditioned by society to think that crime, corruption and dishonesty is &#8220;the way it is&#8221; and that there will always be people who want to abuse, hurt and take advantage of others. Religion is the largest promoter of this propaganda, for the &#8220;us and them&#8221; or &#8220;good and evil&#8221; mentality promotes this false assumption. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>The reality is that we live in a society that produces Scarcity. The consequence of this scarcity is that human beings must behave in self preserving ways, even if it means they have to cheat and steal in order to get what they want. Our research has concluded that Scarcity is one of the most fundamental causes of aberrant human behavior, while also leading to complex forms of neurosis in other ways. A statistical look at drug addiction, crime and incarceration statistics, finds that poverty and unhealthy social conditions comprise the life experience of those who engage in such behavior. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Human beings are not good or bad&#8230; they are running, forever changing compositions of the life experience(s) that influences them. The &#8220;quality&#8221; of a human being ( if there was such a thing ) is directly related to the upbringing and thus belief systems they have been conditioned into. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>This simple reality has been grossly overlooked and today people primitively think that competition, greed and corruption are &#8220;hardwired&#8221; elements of human behavior and, in turn, we must have prisons, police and hence a hierarchy of differential control in order for society to deal with these &#8220;tendencies&#8221;. This is totally illogical and false. </strong><br />\n<strong>Fundamentally, you must begin to address root causes.</strong></p>\n<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/4Z9WVZddH9w?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></p>\n</div>\n<h4></h4>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.activistpost.com/2012/07/landmark-family-farmers-lawsuit-against.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Landmark Family Farmers Lawsuit Against Monsanto Grows</a> (activistpost.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.eastbayexpress.com/WhatTheFork/archives/2012/07/23/bay-area-urban-farmers-featured-in-new-documentary-edible-city\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bay Area Urban Farmers Featured in New Documentary &#8216;Edible City&#8217;</a> (eastbayexpress.com)</li>\n</ul>\n", "post_id": 2432, "location": false, "date": "07-24-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<h2 id=\"post-22754\"></h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.theveritasmagazine.com/66-things-you-can-grow-at-home-in-containers-without-a-garden.html\">66 Things You Can Grow At Home: In Containers, Without A Garden | The Veritas Magazine</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>The Veritas Magazine</strong></p>\n<p><strong>From <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Apple\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">apples</a> and figs to bananas and guavas \u2014 and hops.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Source: <a href=\"http://www.planetgreen/discovery.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.planetgreen/discovery.com/</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>By <a href=\"http://planetgreen.discovery.com/author/rachel-cernansky/\">Rachel Cernansky</a> | Mon Apr 26, 2010</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Growing your own food is exciting, not only because you get to see things grow from nothing into ready-to-eat <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Fruit\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">fruits</a> and veggies, but you also don\u2019t have to worry about the <a href=\"http://planetgreen.discovery.com/food-health/eat-organic-foods.html\">pesticides they might contain</a>, and you definitely cut down on the <a href=\"http://fogcity.blogs.com/jen/2005/08/10_reasons_to_e.html\">miles they</a>\u2014<a href=\"http://www.treehugger.com/files/2010/02/reduce-carbon-foodprint-go-vegetarian-walk-bike-to-store.php\">and you</a>\u2014have to travel.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>As it turns out, with pretty minimal effort, <a href=\"http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1356&amp;dat=19870905&amp;id=nI8xAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=zgYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6430,2235560\">anyone can be a gardener</a>.

But <strong>what\u2019s frustrating about the banking debate is how narrowly focused most contributors are. </strong></p>\n<p>Critics of the commercial banks loudly vent their outrage at the covert manipulation of interest rates, for example. But almost nobody thinks to question the overt manipulation of interest rates on the part of central banks.</p>\n<p><strong>It is generally accepted that central banks should be allowed to set interest rates.</strong> In the US, the base rate is effectively zero.</p>\n<p>In the UK, it\u2019s now being held at 0.50%, explicitly to help the banking sector at the expense of all non-bank members of the population who are unable to earn an economic return on their savings.</p>\n<p>One might ask <strong>why we take this official rate manipulation for granted.</strong> One would also ask why the economically critical business of SAVING is being so offhandedly crushed in the name of banking expedience\u2026</p>\n<p>Why, for example, <strong>do we need a central bank at all?<br />\n</strong><br />\nA typical if feeble answer is that we need a lender of last resort.

New research suggests moment-to-moment awareness does a better job of helping people control their weight than any diet.</strong></em></p>\n<p>Deborah Hill used to think she was skinny. Her 5 foot 9 inch frame could take on a lot of weight without making her look out of shape. But last year she was shocked to discover that she weighed over 210 pounds, which classified her as medically obese.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was just crazy,\u201d says Hill. \u201cI\u2019d never had a problem with weight.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hill is one of a growing number of Americans\u2014over 35 percent, according to the Center for Disease Control\u2014who are considered obese, having a body mass index of 30 or greater. Obesity increases health risks like heart disease, stroke, and diabetes, to name a few, and the health care costs to treat obesity-related illness are skyrocketing, with CDC estimates in 2008 reaching $147 billion dollars.</p>\n<div><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/greatergood.berkeley.edu/images/uploads/socialintelligencewillpower.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"347\" height=\"417\" />Danny Hellman</div>\n<p>But now there is a new prescription for combating obesity, one that goes beyond ubiquitous diet and exercise regimens: mindfulness, the moment-to-moment awareness of our thoughts, feelings, and surroundings.</p>\n<p>Researchers are learning that teaching obese individuals mindful eating skills\u2014like paying closer attention to their bodies\u2019 hunger cues and learning to savor their food\u2014can help them change unhealthy eating patterns and lose weight. And, unlike other forms of treatment, mindfulness may get at the underlying causes of overeating\u2014like craving, stress, and emotional eating\u2014which make it so hard to defeat.</p>\n<p>Mindfulness has definitely helped Hill. In the last year, she has lost 40 pounds and developed a much healthier relationship to food and eating.</p>\n<p>\u201cMindfulness has been huge for me,\u201d she says.</p>\n<p><strong>Why mindfulness?</strong></p>\n<p>Jean Kristeller, a professor emeritus of psychology at Indiana State University, is a pioneer in the field. She first became interested in applying mindfulness to eating issues when working as a clinician with overweight college students who were compulsively eating large quantities of food\u2014or \u201cbinging.\u201d She thought her students had an underlying dysfunctional relationship to food that was being ignored in the clinical community in favor of dieting, which \u201cdidn\u2019t mesh\u201d for her.</p>\n<p>But when she encountered\u00a0<a href=\"http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/why_mindfulness_matters/\">Jon Kabat-Zinn\u2019s Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction</a>\u00a0(MBSR) program, she says, \u201c<em>more</em>\u00a0than a light bulb\u201d went off for her. She wondered if it could be possible to teach people with eating disorders to become refocused on their internal hunger and signs that they were full\u2014and develop a more accepting approach to food and eating.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe was taking a tradition of cultivating awareness and an accepting way of our experiences\u2014both inner and outer\u2014and encouraging people to bring themselves into better balance,\u201d says Kristeller. \u201cThis fit with my theoretical model of reconnecting people with their inner experiences.\u201d</p>\n<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/xoLQ3qkh0w0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></p>\n<p>With the help of a doctoral student, she created a program called Mindfulness-Based Eating Awareness Training\u2014or MB-EAT, based on Kabat-Zinn\u2019s MBSR\u2014that teaches people how to taste their food, recognize their levels of hunger and fullness, and be more accepting of their food preferences. One exercise involves eating a few raisins slowly, paying close attention to their flavor sensations and how they change with time.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen most people do the raisin exercise, they are stunned by it,\u201d says Kristeller. \u201cThey see that if they eat a few raisins mindfully they can enjoy them as much or more than if they eat a whole box.\u201d</p>\n<p>Of course, even Kristeller admits that it\u2019s easier to get people to regulate their intake with health foods, like raisins, than \u201cproblem foods,\u201d like chocolate brownies. So, the program doesn\u2019t stop with raisins\u2014it teaches people that, once they learn to pay attention, brownies can be best experienced and savored in a smaller number of bites.</p>\n<p>Many obese people, says Kristeller, have developed a particular pattern: They try to control their eating through avoidance or limit-setting, thinking \u201cwillpower\u201d is what they need. Then, when their plans go awry\u2014as they inevitably do\u2014they tell themselves that they\u2019ve \u201cblown it\u201d and give up.</p>\n<p>From a mindfulness perspective, she says, there is never a point of no return: One can choose to eat mindfully at anytime, even after \u201cblowing it.\u201d In addition, since the program teaches people not to avoid foods but to savor them, people don\u2019t feel as deprived. Kristeller tries to take the guilt out of enjoying food and to help people honor their food preferences.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe try to help people cultivate their inner gourmet,\u201d she says.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/20417192\">Jean Kristeller, Ph.D: \u201cMindfulness Based Eating\u201d</a>\u00a0from\u00a0<a href=\"http://vimeo.com/omegainstitute\">Omega Institute</a>\u00a0on\u00a0<a href=\"http://vimeo.com/\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>What the research says</strong></p>\n<p>Kristeller tested her MB-EAT program in a pilot study with a group of 18 binge eaters. The women participated in seven sessions of a group treatment program, which included assessments prior to and following treatment.</p>\n<p>At the end of treatment, binges dropped from slightly over four to about 1.5 per week, with only four participants still meeting criteria for <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Binge eating disorder\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binge_eating_disorder\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">Binge Eating Disorder</a> when the researchers followed up with questions after treatment. In addition, the women demonstrated a better relationship to food and eating, and their depression and anxiety decreased.</p>\n<p>In a second study, conducted with Ruth Quillian-Wolever of Duke University, Kristeller tested the MB-EAT program on a group of obese binge eaters, comparing the group at one month and four months post-treatment to two control groups, one of which went through another educational program.</p>\n<p>Although both the educational and MB-EAT groups reduced their binging behavior, those in the MB-EAT group showed signs of greater overall self-regulation and balance around eating, and sustained improvement in binge eating. Plus, the degree to which the women incorporated mindfulness practices into their lives predicted much of this improvement and the degree of weight loss they experienced.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis study showed that success wasn\u2019t just about group work and getting support,\u201c says Kristeller, \u201cbut that their success at losing weight was directly related to the degree to which they used mindfulness techniques.\u201d</p>\n<p>Currently there is no data that shows what is happening in the brain when people practice mindful eating. But Kristeller points to the large body of research on MBSR showing that people who use mindfulness increase the size and function of their pre-frontal cortex, the area of the brain connected to decision making and long-range planning. She hypothesizes that mindful eating strengthens this same area of the brain, making it easier for people to cognitively process their desire to eat, rather than feeling victim to the emotional center that often drives eating.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are interrupting the reactivity cycle,\u201d says Kristeller.</p>\n<p><strong>Stress in eating and obesity</strong></p>\n<p>Elissa Epel, the founder and director of the Center for Obesity Assessment, Study, and Treatment at the University of California, San Francisco, has been researching the role of stress in overeating. One of the biggest, most reliable paths to obesity, she says, is high stress, because it changes our appetite, stimulates overeating, and makes us more insulin-resistant, a factor that elevates blood sugar and can put as at risk for Type 2 diabetes.</p>\n<p>\u201cStress affects the same signals as famine does. It turns on the brain pathways that make us crave dense calories\u2014we\u2019ll choose high fat, high sweet foods, or high salt,\u201d says Epel. \u201cWhen we have a \u2018stress brain,\u2019 food is even more rewarding.\u201d</p>\n<div><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/greatergood.berkeley.edu/images/uploads/elissa.jpg\" alt=\"Elissa Epel, founder and director of the UCSF Center for Obesity Assessment, Study, and Treatment.\" width=\"200\" height=\"301\" />Elissa Epel, founder and director of the UCSF Center for Obesity Assessment, Study, and Treatment.</div>\n<p>Epel notes that surveys show 50-60 percent of women eat for emotional reasons rather than because of hunger. The stress of difficult emotions dampens the reward response in the brain and causes craving, which is what drives overeating\u2014as well as drug use\u2014in some people. According to Epel, the hunger and reward drives are the strongest drives in the human body and very difficult to change.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen the obese brain tricks you into thinking that you\u2019re starving, it\u2019s hard to fight that,\u201d she says.</p>\n<p>Her lab has studied the impact of mindfulness training on people\u2019s stress metabolism. Normally, fat distribution in women is concentrated in the hips; but women who release high levels of cortisol, the stress-related hormone, tend to store fat in the deep belly tissue\u2014fat that is very difficult to take off. Epel and post-doctoral fellow Jennifer Daubenmier decided to test a program similar to Kristeller\u2019s MB-EAT program but with added stress reduction exercises on obese women to see how it would impact the women\u2019s cortisol levels and fat distribution.</p>\n<p>Results showed that the more mindfulness the women practiced, the greater their anxiety, chronic stress, and deep belly fat decreased. In addition, the women in the mindfulness program maintained their body weight while the women in the control group increased their weight over the same period of time.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is what we call a proof of concept study,\u201d says Epel. \u201cWe didn\u2019t ask people to change how many calories they ate; we just wanted to know if decreasing stress would have an impact by changing fat distribution, and it did.\u201d</p>\n<p>In a more recent study, of which Deborah Hill is a participant, Epel and colleagues are looking at how mindfulness techniques affect weight loss. The program aims to reduce stress, increase awareness of external and internal cues for eating (like being in a party situation or feeling bored), and foster more self-acceptance around food, while teaching people about nutrition. While data from the study is still being evaluated, Epel expresses surprise by the promising results so far.</p>\n<p>\u201cMindfulness has turned out to be much more powerful than I thought, in its ability to affect weight,\u201d she says.</p>\n<p><strong>Not a panacea</strong></p>\n<p>Still, the research on mindful eating is relatively young, and it is not without its critics. One concern is that the mindfulness approach is too weak to be effective, given the overwhelming problems with our current food environment, such as the prevalence and cheapness of unhealthy, high calorie foods, and the marketing that pushes convenience foods on an overly stressed population.</p>\n<p>Michele Mietus-Snyder, co-director of the Obesity Institute at Children\u2019s National Medical Center in Washington, D.C., has been studying childhood obesity in highly stressed communities, where obesity levels tend to be highest.</p>\n<div><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/greatergood.berkeley.edu/images/uploads/speakersMichele_Mietus-Snyder.jpg\" alt=\"Michele Mietus-Snyder, co-director of the Obesity Institute at Children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s National Medical Center.\" width=\"150\" height=\"225\" />Michele Mietus-Snyder, co-director of the Obesity Institute at Children\u2019s National Medical Center.</div>\n<p>As part of a study funded by the American Heart Association, Mietus-Snyder taught mindfulness, as well as nutrition and healthy eating, to a group of inner-city kids and their parents in Northern California to see what impact it would have on the kids\u2019 levels of stress, cortisol, and c-reactive protein, a risk factor in heart disease.</p>\n<p>She quickly learned how \u201cna\u00efve\u201d she was to think that these tools could make a significant impact. Because of the chaotic environment in which the study families lived, it was hard for them to participate consistently, even though the parents and kids both seemed receptive to the program.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe tool of mindfulness, as valuable as it is, could just not take root in these kids\u2019 lives,\u201d says Mietus-Snyder. \u201cThe entropy of life took over.\u201d</p>\n<p>Results from her study found that neither the mindfulness group nor a control group\u2014who received exercise in place of the mindfulness class\u2014changed their metabolic profile by much, though both groups did have overall reductions in anxiety and in the kids\u2019 body mass index scores. She hypothesizes that just bringing the parents and kids together once a week to learn about healthy eating may have been at least partly responsible for the positive results in both groups.</p>\n<p>But what was most discouraging to Mietus-Snyder was the paucity of nutrition she found in the kids\u2019 diets, which caused their metabolic systems to become inefficient and dysfunctional. She wonders if this, more than anything, impacted the effectiveness of the mindfulness intervention.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re just climbing uphill with these kids,\u201d she says.</p>\n<p>Mietus-Snyder believes the most important thing society can do to eliminate obesity is to improve the food environment for these kids. The government should intercede and more closely regulate food production and distribution, especially in schools, she says.</p>\n<p>Epel shares that concern, but still sees the need for a two-pronged approach.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe need to change food policies, not just focus on how people change their response to it,\u201d she agrees. \u201cBut we need to work from both sides of this issue.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>No more food fights</strong></p>\n<p>Before Deborah Hill entered Epel\u2019s mindfulness treatment program, her doctor had warned her that her cholesterol and triglyceride levels were high, a risk factor for diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. She\u2019d tried diets and programs like Weight Watchers, but felt that they weren\u2019t helping her with the emotional side of her eating.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m an emotional eater,\u201d says Hill. \u201cI eat because I\u2019m bored, stressed, or just because.\u201d</p>\n<p>Through the mindful eating program, she has learned how to slow down, evaluate how she\u2019s feeling, and make better choices.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow if I want a piece of cake, I really taste it,\u201d she says. \u201cAfter four to five bites, I re-evaluate and ask myself: Do I really want it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Although doing the daily mindfulness meditation has been hard for her, she finds other ways to de-stress, and has become more \u201cadventurous\u201d around eating, sometimes choosing arugula salad over fried chicken and mashed potatoes, for example. But, she doesn\u2019t deny herself anything, she claims, even eating a burger when she wants to, as long as she stays aware of making the choice and not because \u201cit\u2019s there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not on a diet; I\u2019m on a lifestyle change,\u201d says Hill. \u201cI eat what I want.

It&#8217;s a win-win-win all round: Growers who have surplus or seconds find a good home for these edibles beyond the compost pile; financially strapped aid organizations get much-needed fresh food for free for their patrons; and the gleaners get to give back in their communities. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been surprised at how emotionally rewarding this is,&#8221; says Andrew Sigal, an avid gardener in Oakland, California, who started\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.foodpool.org/default.html\">Food Pool</a>\u00a0last summer to share the abundance from his prolific 800-square-foot garden with local food pantries. &#8220;It&#8217;s one thing to give someone in need a dollar or a donation, but seeing someone get excited about beans from my backyard has been deeply fulfilling.&#8221;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.shareable.net/sites/default/files/upload/inline/745/images/lemontree%281%29.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /><br />\n<em>Lemon trees often produce far more fruit than a single family can use.

Take\u00a0<a href=\"http://thelemonlady.blogspot.com/\">The Lemon Lady</a>, aka Anna Chan, a stay-at-home mom who began collecting excess fruit in suburban Clayton, California, while driving her then-baby daughter around to nap. Chan, who knew hunger as a child and how it felt to wait in food lines for canned goods, was shocked to see so much fresh fruit \u2014 such as oranges, apricots, and apples \u2014 left rotting in her neighbors&#8217; front yards. so she started a single-handed campaign to do something about it.</p>\n<p>Three years on and hundreds of tons of produce later, Chan, who is now a regular fixture at local farmers&#8217; markets where she collects unsold fruits and vegetables that she hauls to a local food pantry and Salvation Army site, has been featured in\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20498383,00.html\">People</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/26/huffpost-greatest-person-_n_867552.html\">The Huffington Post</a>, and\u00a0<a href=\"http://civileats.com/2009/10/28/the-lemon-lady-feeding-the-hungry-one-bag-of-produce-at-a-time/\">Civil Eats</a>. While the press attention has helped her cause, she keeps a laser-like focus on her mission to feed those in need. \u201cMany people don\u2019t know where their local food pantry is located and don\u2019t realize that food banks will gladly take fresh produce,\u201d says Chan, who encourages people to get started by picking excess fruits and veggies in their immediate area and passing it on.</p>\n<p>From California to New York and places in between, communities are finding<a href=\"http://www.shareable.net/blog/feed-the-locavore-in-you\">creative</a><a href=\"http://www.shareable.net/blog/feed-the-locavore-in-you\">, local ways</a>\u00a0to get fresh food to the residents who have the most challenges accessing such food.\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.breadforthecity.org/gleanforthecity/\">Glean for the City</a>\u00a0in Washington, D.C., for example, has a three-pronged approach: picking surplus produce from regional farms, gathering leftover greens from farmers&#8217; markets, and harvesting excess residential edibles.</p>\n<p>Since 1988,\u00a0<a href=\"http://friendshipdonations.org/\">Friendship Donations Network</a>\u00a0in Ithaca, New York, has worked with local farmers to &#8220;rescue&#8221; thousands of pounds of produce that would otherwise go to waste and distribute it to low-wage workers, the elderly, and the young. Gleaned produce donated by the organization serves 24 programs that feed more than 2,000 people a week. The model just makes sense, says FDN program coordinator Meaghan Sheehan Rosen, who points out that there&#8217;s no reason perfectly good food should go uneaten if farmers are willing and people are needy.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.shareable.net/sites/default/files/upload/inline/745/images/blackberry.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"400\" /><br />\n<em>Blackberries grow wild all over rural and, often, suburban areas.

In the\u00a0<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Ruth\" target=\"_blank\">Book of Ruth</a>, for instance, the poor are permitted to pick grain leftover from the harvest. The<a href=\"http://www.endhunger.org/gleaning_network.htm\">Society</a><a href=\"http://www.endhunger.org/gleaning_network.htm\"> of St. Andrews</a>, based in Virginia, has gleaning groups in several states including Arkansas, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania that have collectively gleaned millions of pounds of produce.\u00a0<a href=\"http://faithfeedslex.org/\">Faith Feeds</a>, a Lexington, Kentucky, gleaning group that grew out of a church meeting, has picked up more than 111,000 pounds of produce since the summer of 2010, from farmers&#8217; markets, farms, and private residences. &#8220;It is not hard to feed the hungry,&#8221; says Jennifer Erena of Faith Feeds, an interfaith group not affiliated with any particular religion or church. &#8220;The word is spreading and there&#8217;s a wonderful energy among different people and organizations that is both collaborative and community oriented.&#8221;</p>\n<p>There are gleaning programs that connect homeowners overwhelmed by an abundant harvest with volunteers willing to pick produce and take it to local food banks, such as\u00a0<a href=\"http://portlandfruit.org/\">Portland Fruit</a>\u00a0in Oregon. But many gleaning efforts are simply started by an individual who sees a need and wants to fill it. &#8220;I particularly like picking fruit for seniors, many of whom can no longer climb a ladder or aren\u2019t able to do physical labor anymore,&#8221; says\u00a0<a href=\"http://northberkeleyharvest.org/\">North Berkeley Harvest</a>\u00a0founder Natasha Boissier, who started solo but now works with a group of volunteers. &#8220;They come out and talk with me while I work, and I appreciate and respect their wisdom and experience, and hearing about the ups and downs of having lived life. These moments of connection have brought me \u2014 and I hope them \u2014 a great deal of unexpected joy.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bossier&#8217;s first stop with fresh food is often the local men\u2019s shelter. &#8220;These men are often blamed for what\u2019s wrong with them,&#8221; says the clinical social worker. &#8220;I see them early in the morning standing out in the cold after enduring a night of who knows what and I want to give them a piece of fruit to offer a moment\u2019s respite from their pain and suffering. That\u2019s my hope: To provide something tangible, simple, and sweet in their lives.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Some gleaning programs have become an integral part of their community. Take the\u00a0<a href=\"http://whatsforlunchsolutions.com/Gleaning\">Novato Unified School District Gleaning Program</a>. Every week for the past six years, parents, students, and members of this Marin County, California, community glean excess organic produce from a participating local farm. (There are about 15 in the program.) Through a partnership with\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.marinorganic.org/organic_school_lunch.php\">Marin Organic</a>, a cooperative association of local growers, that fresh chard picked by a volunteer on Monday finds it way into school pasta sauce later in the week. The gleaned fruits and vegetables now offsets up to 25 percent of the district&#8217;s weekly produce, according to Miguel Villarreal, the director of food and nutrition services for the small school district, where some 4,000 meals a day are dished up at 13 schools.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.shareable.net/sites/default/files/upload/inline/745/images/kale.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /><br />\n<em>One of several varieties of kale, lacinato kale grows abundantly and can be used in numerous healthy dishes.

Melita Love, of\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.farmtopantry.org/\">Farm to Pantry</a>\u00a0in Healdsburg, California, found a community of people in her new hometown when she started gleaning. Love has collaborated with local preservers to extend the shelf life of the bounty she and her crew harvest in such staples as applesauce and tomato sauce \u2014 think\u00a0<a href=\"http://blogs.kqed.org/bayareabites/2010/12/11/canning-for-a-cause-lets-preserve/\">canning for a cause</a>\u00a0\u2014 that food pantry patrons can pick up along with gleaned fresh goods. She&#8217;s also worked with local groups to explain to patrons how to use produce that may be unfamiliar. &#8220;The first time we dropped off kale to a food pantry nobody took it because they didn&#8217;t know what to do with it,&#8221; says Love. &#8220;So we did cooking demos for kale salad, kale chips, and a winter soup with kale, and we handed out recipes, too.

It is the starting point for all of reality, as we are able to perceive it.  All things in the realm of consciousness must originate with an Idea.  Idea is not quite like imagining.  When we imagine we take an Idea and expand upon it in fantastical ways.  But we must still first have an Idea from which to begin our imaginings.  Idea is not exactly thought, either.  A thought is a contemplation, a reaction or a response to something presented.  For there to be thought there must be elaboration, depth and even style.  But what are we giving depth to, what are we elaborating upon?  The original thing presented is of course, the Idea.  The thought defines the Idea, categorizes it and evaluates it.  But the Idea stands primary.  It existed before the thought and will exist after.  Idea is the spark.</p>\n<p>What a vast and spectacular thing is Idea.  It is limitless, it has no boundaries, no rules.  It comes from inspiration, spans generations and even centuries and is nearly impossible to extinguish.  It gives birth to hope and Love and movement.  It brings forth pain and misery and fear.  Idea comes to us with a shiver and leaves us in awe.  It is the drive that empowers us in our darkest hour, the cherished goal to our greatest success.</p>\n<p>I have an Idea.  One which spans many different topics and elaborates upon many different thoughts.  But it is one Idea.  It is the Idea of Love.  Love explained.  Love understood.  Love perfected.  Because Love itself is an Idea.  And it is the Idea we are here to learn about in this life. We have reached a critical point in our development as humans.  It is imperative that we begin to understand the Idea of Love before it is too late.  It is a simple lesson, a subtle truth, yet suffering often interferes with our ability to learn it.  In the end, however, it is the only way to live.  The only way humanity can sustain itself.  Without a solid understanding of the Idea of Love, our future is surely lost to us.  We cannot continue to live like infants.</p>\n<p>And so I present to you the Truth, as best I can discern it.  I have spent many years contemplating these ideas.  I have written them down in various fashions, updated them and re-analyzed their meanings.  In the end I can come up with only one Truth.  One answer to save humanity.  The Idea of Love is manifested through Balanced Emotions.</p>\n<p>The Idea of Love is manifested through Balanced Emotions.</p>\n<p>That is it.  That is the basis for this blog.  It is the basis for life on Earth, as far as I can tell.  The investigation of this one Idea is primary to all beings on this planet.  If we can begin to understand what this one sentence implies, then we can begin to live within Love.  And in time we shall see that we create Love everywhere around us.  Because now we have become Love.  So let us explore this Idea.  Let us take the first steps towards living in Love.  Let us see how the Idea of Love is manifested through Balanced Emotions.</p>\n<p>Read Next:</p>\n<table width=\"250\" border=\"1\" bgcolor=\"#99ccff\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;\" align=\"center\"><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.wordpress.com/2011/12/09/balance/\">Balance</a></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n", "post_id": 2483, "location": false, "date": "07-30-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://www.activistpost.com/2012/07/authorities-seek-to-destroy-couples.html\">Activist Post: Authorities Seek to Destroy Couple\u2019s Immaculate Edible Landscape</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Will international activism save this couple\u2019s garden from a town code?</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/gfx/images/news/topstories/2012/07/18/li-garden.jpg\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.cbc.ca/gfx/images/news/topstories/2012/07/18/li-garden.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"112\" border=\"0\" /></a>Heather Callaghan<br />\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.activistpost.com/2012/07/authorities-seek-to-destroy-couples.html\">Activist Post</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>July 30,2012</strong><br />\n<strong><br />\nPeople are hungry, economies everywhere are tanking. The answer to that problem used to be \u201cdo what you can on your own.\u201d In America, it was the now iconic Victory Gardens. In Montreal, Canada there is a move to defeat such self-reliance.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>For some strange reason, helping yourself is the very last thing the governments in both the U.S. and Canada will \u201callow\u201d you to do; not even on your own land. Stranger still, it is the lower-rung, local governments that show up in news stories extinguishing property rights in the name of almighty municipal code.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Jos\u00e9e Landry and partner Michel Beauchamp decided to start an urban garden for both economic and health reasons, and they even have documented its progress via their family <a href=\"http://www.lepotagerurbain.com/\" target=\"_blank\">blog</a> since its beginning. They proudly gave their new passion a name \u2013 Rosa \u2013 in memory of civil rights icon, Rosa Parks, who refused to take her place as ordered by the tyrannical bureaucracy of the day.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Now it seems that they find themselves forced to take a stand for another basic civil right: food freedom. Instead of allowing this garden to\u00a0flourish\u00a0and nourish, local officials in Canada now want to make any new front yard gardens completely illegal by autumn, along with uprooting Rosa.</strong></p>\n<p><strong><a name=\"more\"></a>The crackdown on home gardening has been marching across the first world at a rapid pace of late. \u00a0In the U.S. we have seen a <a href=\"http://www.activistpost.com/2011/07/charges-not-dropped-for-growing-garden.html\" target=\"_blank\">woman threatened with jail for 93</a> days for front yard tomatoes and a <a href=\"http://www.activistpost.com/2012/06/woman-sues-city-of-tulsa-for-cutting.html\" target=\"_blank\">Tulsa, OK woman sued</a> after coming home to find her yard full of herbal remedies and vegetation ripped up and taken. Oftentimes, it\u2019s a power play, and only when enough negative attention is garnered, do the code enforcers back down, usually citing their targets for some other minor infraction.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>This latest move in Canada follows a similar pattern; by enforcing an arbitrary code that front yard gardens (also called kitchen gardens) are only allowed, at the bare minimum, less than 30% vegetation. Who in Drummondville, Quebec would create such a code and why? Also, shouldn\u2019t other factors be considered: they own their home, they offer the food to the community without profit, it is aesthetic and has attracted worldwide media attention, as well as some celebrity garden bloggers.</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/lh3.ggpht.com/_bivbTnRfrVE/TDMuv8-gLmI/AAAAAAAABtc/VwpQu3Qgyvs/June%20Front%20Garden_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"512\" height=\"333\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Not only does the city want most of the couple\u2019s garden uprooted and tossed, but they are seriously discussing outlawing all future front yard gardens!

CEO of Drummondville, Claude Proulx, called it\u00a0a question of \u201cuniformity of the urban fabric.\u201d</strong></p>\n<p><strong>But, Beauchamp has been open with his neighbors, and they have shared the fun and eats. He has had no inkling of anyone disliking the tidy and delicious landscape, adding, \u201cThey love it.

No sooner had he featured the Canadian garden on his site when they get slammed with threats of hundreds of dollars in fines if they didn\u2019t rip it out and replant grass. Do you think he wonders why the White House shows the world about gardening, and then municipalities everywhere start simultaneously cracking down on their residents?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>What does it ultimately take to stop the rolling boulder of unyielding municipal power? As evidenced above and in other cases, a negative spotlight, lots of outraged people, and the threat of losing an election (and salary and pension) speaks volumes.

He loves to garden with his 55 heirlooms and dislikes <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Genetically modified organism\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_organism\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">GMOs</a> and pesticides.</p>\n<p>But, like so many others now, he was pushed around and literally stalked by &#8220;Code Enforcers&#8221; out to aggressively eradicate any &#8220;nuisance&#8221; that doesn&#8217;t match the rest of their desired Stepford neighborhood. This is after he, also like many targeted for garden deconstruction, <em>painstakingly</em> followed <em>the rules</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cI just thought it would be an excellent way to help provide for my family,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.mofreedom.org/2012/07/victory-freedom-center-uproots-petty-tyranny-in-ferguson/\" target=\"_blank\">he said</a>. \u201cPeople have been gardening since the beginning of human civilization, and the First Lady has even been setting an example by gardening at the White House! I never expected it to be so controversial.\u201d</p>\n<p>City officials in Ferguson, Missouri do not care if someone is trying to feed his family on his turf; so they literally cited Tricamo&#8217;s landlord with\u00a0&#8216;Failure to meet the minimum standards of the City of Ferguson exterior appearance code.&#8217;</p>\n<p>Now, doesn&#8217;t that sound like a highly subjective code? It would, had it been an actual code instead of an intimidation tactic.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/gardentherapy.ca/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Front-Garden-April-2010-5-Medium.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"452\" height=\"234\" /></p>\n<p><a name=\"more\"></a>Karl&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.treehugger.com/lawn-garden/stay-home-dad-wins-right-front-yard-vegetable-garden.html#mkcpgn=fbth1\" target=\"_blank\">neighbors</a> seemed to be in accordance with his fruitful yard plan. One of them even allowed Tricamo to plant tomatoes in her garden as a &#8220;show of solidarity.&#8221;<br />\nPerhaps more neighbors felt compelled to lend support after the board sent a letter to Tricamo and all nearby residents <a href=\"http://vegetableyarden.wordpress.com/2012/07/06/ive-tried/\" target=\"_blank\">saying</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The owner of 309 Louisa wishes to utilize his property, currently zoned R-1D, for agricultural purposes by planting tall crops which will cover the entire front yard of the property. City Staff has determined that such use is not allowed within that zoning district under Chapter 49, the <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Zoning\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoning\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">Zoning Ordinance</a> for the City of Ferguson and, otherwise, constitutes a nuisance. The owner appeals that determination.</p></blockquote>\n<p>City officials changed their citings a lot, and really never could give Tricamo an actual code that prohibited a garden, especially since the ordinances specifically allow for vegetation, with no height requirements. So they obnoxiously tried to paint his yard into a large-scale commercial farm saying he needs permission to engage in &#8220;agriculture!&#8221;</p>\n<p>Adding to that absurdity, the enforcers cased his place week after week; they would drive by, or park out front and watch the yard.</p>\n<p>Karl did not cave when he received\u00a0nuisance\u00a0warnings and commands to first lay down hay and plant grass, and later to rip up his vegetables. But, as he documents on his <a href=\"http://vegetableyarden.wordpress.com/2012/07/10/another-creepy-drive-by/\" target=\"_blank\">blog</a>, the constant\u00a0harassment\u00a0and drive-bys for months were not easy on him and his family.</p>\n<p>Tricamo and his landlord, Jesse Brandt, were represented by Libertarian attorney Dave Roland of <a href=\"http://www.mofreedom.org/2012/07/city-officials-in-ferguson-attempt-to-bulldoze-citizens-rights-gardens/\" target=\"_blank\">Freedom Center of Missouri</a> who argued with the board on the basis of constitutional rights with supporting evidence that there were no code violations. Neighbors and family pitched in their support at the board meeting.</p>\n<p>With all the help, Brandt and Tricamo&#8217;s citations and fines were struck down in a Board of Adjustment decision by a \u00a04-1 vote!</p>\n<p>&#8220;We felt vindicated,&#8221; Karl said. &#8220;I had taken steps from day one that everything would be within ordinance. They just tried to throw everything at us and hoped something would stick.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The one opposing vote came from an upset <a href=\"http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/ferguson-resident-wins-fight-for-front-yard-vegetable-garden/article_a5452134-2a26-5dc5-9c16-0c1c212c8ff3.html#.UBVa7oOlAx4.facebook\">Joe Schroeder</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The board felt that, technically, he had the law in his favor &#8211; But I think that all of us on the board agreed that the garden is an eyesore. It goes against common sense, really, to put a garden in the front yard instead of the back.</p></blockquote>\n<p>So the law should be based on someone else&#8217;s &#8220;common sense&#8221;? Or what is aesthetically pleasing to a board member?</p>\n<p>Karl addressed the all-too typical response from people who&#8217;d rather go along to get along &#8211; the ones who say, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you just grow in the back yard?&#8221; Or, &#8220;Why not just flowers and grass?&#8221; The point is, that to him, he is within community ordinances and not trying to appease or placate others&#8217; demands. He wishes others would appreciate the diversity of plant life he diligently cultivated. If this weren&#8217;t such an ordeal, and if bureaucrats weren&#8217;t over his shoulder, he would prefer to let what we call &#8220;weeds&#8221; survive as they do in nature; as they do serve a purpose and are not aesthetically displeasing to everyone.</p>\n<p>Freedom lover Roland is proud of people who face intimidation by taking on city hall. He said of the victory:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I\u2019m proud of Mr. Tricamo and Mr. Brandt, because in standing up for their own constitutional rights, they have given hope to everyone else who might face a similar situation.</p></blockquote>\n<p>These &#8220;code enforcers&#8221; need to realize that in an effort to make a job for themselves with undue power tactics and by charging fines, that they are in fact alienating their tax-paying hardworking residents who can either vote them out or leave the local economy.

But I think that most of us, most of the time, are not doing all the things that we do, <em>with love</em>. I think we, the collective We, make things much more complicated that simple love would have them be. And I think usually the things we do are aimed at fulfilling personal desires for security, power, enrichment, status. I think &#8212; &amp; this saddens me, momentarily &#8212; that we, the collective We, don&#8217;t know <em>ho</em>w to &#8220;do&#8221; with love. We clutter most of our behavior with many other motives. For much of my own life, this has been true.</p>\n<p>But, I am willing to imagine that it does not need to continue being this way. And, yes, <em>I will actively search</em>\u00a0for examples to disprove my theory &#8212; after all, how do I know what motivations most of us actually have?!? Really, I want to be wrong about this. I want to believe that people do what they do, with Love as the most important part of their calculations. This is the world I wish to live in. In my imagination, that world is very different from the world as it currently manifests.</p>\n<p>What would we, the collective We, look like, if we did all things with love?? Hmmm, I&#8217;d like your thoughts on this. Here are a few of mine &#8230;&#8230;</p>\n<p>~~<a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/imagescakwkd3d.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-2519\" title=\"Generosity   www.reclaiming.com\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/imagescakwkd3d.jpg?w=288&#038;h=175\" alt=\"\" width=\"288\" height=\"175\" /></a>~Rather than keeping all earned results for oneself, Generosity could be more prevalent: Businesses, agriculture, industry would give away more of their products &amp; services. Maybe for every 100 doohickeys sold, 2 would be donated. For every ton of grain sold, 1/10th would be given. For every dozen paid-for haircuts, 1 is free.</p>\n<p>~~~Love, as both part of the process, &amp; part of the goal, could re-shape the world of public service. People might go into politics because of love for their country, state, community, sure. But could they approve misleading, deceptive ads? Would they sabotage, set out to ruin, or assassinate each other?! Perhaps the term of service would include being supported by the constituents, but not include any actual money (salary), only the necessities: the service is closer to volunteering. And maybe every citizen is required to serve a term of public service at some level, in some capacity.</p>\n<p>Ay yi yi! Already, as I muse upon this, I can feel the rule-making creeping in: <em>how else to make sure it all happens evenly, &amp; fairly? </em>This brings me right up against a concept known in economics as the <a title=\"Tragedy of the commons\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">Tragedy of the Commons</a>&#8212;&gt;&gt; For example, in land owned &amp; used <a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/imagescajun3sc.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-2517\" title=\"Heart in the sand   www.whitestoneinn.com\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/imagescajun3sc.jpg?w=259&#038;h=194\" alt=\"\" width=\"259\" height=\"194\" /></a>communally, some people take advantage, which begins to ruin it for everybody else. Unless there is vigilant &amp; energetic local oversight. I imagine that rule making, rule keeping, with the equitable input of everyone involved, takes a lot of work. I wrote briefly about his before, <a title=\"My post, 'The Commons', at AltEcon\" href=\"http://wp.me/p21f5h-BW\">&#8216;the commons&#8217;</a>\u00a0being an idea that I believe can reshape &amp; enrich the world. But my personal experience of living among any communal resources is limited. <em>What do you know? What have you experienced?</em>\u00a0Sharing your insights with me, &amp; other readers is very very\u00a0welcome, as this is an on-going\u00a0conversation I want to be part of.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Do all things with love.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The way we &#8220;do&#8221; is mostly informed by our unexamined consciousness, I think. But I believe we can change our consciousness, &amp; I know that I&#8217;ve changed over the years, changed what I do &amp; don&#8217;t do, based on &#8220;love&#8221;, &amp; I suspect this is true of many others also. For myself: I&#8217;m no longer willing to take only the best of the produce at the store. I clean up after myself in public bathrooms. I can no longer rationalize any cheating of corporations. I vote, when I used to harangue others about its essential uselessness. I&#8217;ve learned compassion practices, which force me to look at the nature of my own mind, before judging the minds of others. I try hard to understand the motivations behind the choices other people make, &amp; I usually can <a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/imagesca5450ee.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-2518\" title=\"Love in watermelon   www.sauleandriu.blogspot.com\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/imagesca5450ee.jpg?w=275&#038;h=183\" alt=\"\" width=\"275\" height=\"183\" /></a>adjust my thinking when I know them. There are many kinds of work I just cannot do, because of the destructive impact they have of others. And, and &#8230;&#8230;&#8230; I am sure there are many other ways in which I can do what I do, with more love. <em>I want to learn them</em>.</p>\n<p>What are your thoughts?? <em>I really want to know</em>!

This self-destructing political economy sets its goals and measures its performance in terms of ever-increasing corporate profits\u2014in other words by how fast materials can be extracted from Earth and turned into consumer products, weapons, and waste.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A revolution is under way because people are realizing that our needs can be met without destroying our world. We have the technical knowledge, the communication tools, and material resources to grow enough food, ensure clean air and water, and meet rational energy needs. Future generations, if there is a livable world for them, will look back at the epochal transition we are making to a life-sustaining society. And they may well call this the time of the Great Turning. It is happening now.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/images2.fanpop.com/images/photos/3700000/earth-planet-earth-3729223-1152-864.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"452\" height=\"339\" /></p>\n<p>Whether or not it is recognized by corporate-controlled media, the Great Turning is a reality. Although we cannot know yet if it will take hold in time for humans and other complex life forms to survive, we can know that it is under way. And it is gaining momentum, through the actions of countless individuals and groups around the world. To see this as the larger context of our lives clears our vision and summons our courage.</p>\n<p>The Three Dimensions of the Great Turning:</p>\n<p>1. Actions to slow the damage to Earth and its beings</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most visible dimension of the Great Turning, these activities include all the political, legislative, and legal work required to reduce the destruction, as well as direct actions\u2014blockades, boycotts, civil disobedience, and other forms of refusal. A few examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Documenting the ecological and health effects of the Industrial Growth Society;</li>\n<li>Lobbying or protesting against the World Trade Organization and the international trade agreements that endanger ecosystems and undermine social and economic justice;</li>\n<li>Blowing the whistle on illegal and unethical corporate practices;</li>\n<li>Blockading and conducting vigils at places of ecological destruction, such as old-growth forests under threat of clear-cutting or at nuclear dumping grounds.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Work of this kind buys time. It saves some lives, and some ecosystems, species, and cultures, as well as some of the gene pool, for the sustainable society to come. But it is insufficient to bring that society about.</p>\n<p>2. Analysis of structural causes and the creation of structural alternatives</p>\n<p>The second dimension of the Great Turning is equally crucial. To free ourselves and our planet from the damage being inflicted by the Industrial Growth Society, we must understand its dynamics. What are the tacit agreements that create obscene wealth for a few, while progressively impoverishing the rest of humanity? What interlocking causes indenture us to an insatiable economy that uses our Earth as supply house and sewer? It is not a pretty picture, and it takes courage and confidence in our own common sense to look at it with realism; but we are demystifying the workings of the global economy. When we see how this system operates, we are less tempted to demonize the politicians and corporate CEOs who are in bondage to it. And for all the apparent might of the Industrial Growth Society, we can also see its fragility\u2014how dependent it is on our obedience, and how doomed it is to devour itself. In addition to learning how the present system works, we are also creating structural alternatives. In countless localities, like green shoots pushing up through the rubble, new social and economic arrangements are sprouting. Not waiting for our national or state politicos to catch up with us, we are banding together, taking action in our own communities. Flowing from our creativity and collaboration on behalf of life, these actions may look marginal, but they hold the seeds for the future.</p>\n<p>Some of the initiatives in this dimension:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Teach-ins and study groups on the Industrial Growth Society;</li>\n<li>Strategies and programs for nonviolent, citizen-based defense;</li>\n<li>Reduction of reliance on fossil and nuclear fuels and conversion to renewable energy sources;</li>\n<li>Collaborative living arrangements such as co-housing and eco-villages;</li>\n<li>Community gardens, consumer cooperatives, community-supported agriculture, watershed restoration, local currencies&#8230;.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>3. Shift in Consciousness</p>\n<p>These structural alternatives cannot take root and survive without deeply ingrained values to sustain them. They must mirror what we want and how we relate to Earth and each other. They require, in other words, a profound shift in our perception of reality\u2014and that shift is happening now, both as cognitive revolution and spiritual awakening.</p>\n<p>The insights and experiences that enable us to make this shift are accelerating, and they take many forms. They arise as grief for our world, giving the lie to old paradigm notions of rugged individualism, the essential separateness of the self. They arise as glad response to breakthroughs in scientific thought, as reductionism and materialism give way to evidence of a living universe. And they arise in the resurgence of wisdom traditions, reminding us again that our world is a sacred whole, worthy of adoration and service.</p>\n<p>The many forms and ingredients of this dimension include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>General living systems theory;</li>\n<li>Deep ecology and the deep, long-range ecology movement;</li>\n<li><a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Matthew Fox (priest)\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Fox_%28priest%29\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">Creation spirituality</a> and liberation theology;</li>\n<li><a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Engaged Buddhism\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engaged_Buddhism\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">Engaged Buddhism</a> and similar currents in other traditions;</li>\n<li>The resurgence of shamanic traditions;</li>\n<li>Ecofeminism;</li>\n<li>Ecopsychology;</li>\n<li>The simple living movement.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The realizations we make in the third dimension of the Great Turning save us from succumbing to either panic or paralysis. They help us resist the temptation to stick our heads in the sand, or to turn on each other, for scapegoats on whom to vent our fear and rage.</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/armstrong20120704\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">The City as an Ecosystem</a> (ieet.org)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/zeitgeist-shift/blog/41658/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zeitgeist Shift</a> (greenpeace.org)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.ecoearth.info/blog/2012/08/ecological_internet_in_the_str.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ecological Internet: In the Struggle for Global Ecological Sustainability for the Long-Haul</a> (ecoearth.info)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://blog.p2pfoundation.net/debating-abundance-vs-sustainability-in-the-anthropocene/2012/08/08\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Debating Abundance vs Sustainability in the Anthropocene</a> (p2pfoundation.net)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://dissidentvoice.org/2012/08/food-production-and-nature-the-deadly-paradox-of-a-class-riven-society/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Food Production and Nature: the Deadly Paradox of a Class-Riven Society</a> (dissidentvoice.org)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "post_id": 2526, "location": false, "date": "08-08-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<div style=\"width: 250px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/37421747@N00/7323713702\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"zemanta-img-inserted zemanta-img-configured\" title=\"Pam Warhurst\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/farm8.static.flickr.com/7080/7323713702_74d56d82f1_m.jpg\" alt=\"Pam Warhurst\" width=\"240\" height=\"161\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Pam Warhurst (Photo credit: cubicgarden)</p></div>\n<p id=\"tagline\"><strong>From TED TV Info: </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Aug 2012 \u2022 TEDSalon London Spring 2012</strong></p>\n<p><strong>What should a community do with its unused land?

Incredible Edible started small, with the planting of a few community herb gardens in Todmorden, and today has spin-offs in the U.S. and Japan. The community has started projects like Every Egg Matters, which educates people on keeping chickens and encourages them to sell eggs to neighbors, and uses a &#8216;Chicken Map&#8217; to connect consumers and farmers. Incredible Edible Todmorden empowers ordinary people to take control of their communities through active civic engagement.</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>&#8220;I wondered if it was possible to take a town like Todmorden and focus on local food to re-engage people with the planet we live on, create the sort of shifts in behaviour we need to live within the resources we have, stop us thinking like disempowered victims and to start taking responsibility for our own futures.&#8221;</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p><strong><cite>Pam Warhurst</cite></strong></p>\n<div class=\"embed-ted\"><iframe src=\"https://embed-ssl.ted.com/talks/pam_warhurst_how_we_can_eat_our_landscapes.html\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe></div>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://eatdrinkbetter.com/2012/08/10/edible-landscapes-transform-a-town/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Edible Landscapes Transform a Town</a> (eatdrinkbetter.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.wordpress.com/2012/06/26/naturalnews-regional-organic-farming/\" target=\"_blank\">NaturalNews: Regional Organic Farming</a> (alternateeconomy.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://thehappiestcow.wordpress.com/2012/06/07/the-town-where-food-is-free/\" target=\"_blank\">The Town Where FOOD is FREE</a> (thehappiestcow.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://talesfromthelou.wordpress.com/2012/06/27/guerilla-gardening-small-west-yorkshire-town-aims-to-be-first-town-with-food-self-sufficiency-by-growing-all-its-own-vegetables/\" target=\"_blank\">Guerilla Gardening: Small West Yorkshire town aims to be first town with food self-sufficiency by growing all its own vegetables</a> (talesfromthelou.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://defendfreedomsite.wordpress.com/2012/06/07/incredible-edible-launches-scheme-to-grow-and-pick-food-anywhere/\" target=\"_blank\">Incredible Edible launches scheme to grow and pick food anywhere</a> (defendfreedomsite.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://tgrule.com/2012/06/27/small-west-yorkshire-town-aims-to-be-first-town-with-food-self-sufficiency-by-growing-all-its-own-vegetables/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Small West Yorkshire town aims to be first town with food self-sufficiency by growing all its own vegetables.</a> (tgrule.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/at-a-glance/main-section/resident-kathleen-simpson-confronts-cameron-as-he-inspects-flood-hit-todmorden-1-4689645\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Resident Kathleen Simpson confronts Cameron as he inspects flood-hit Todmorden</a> (yorkshirepost.co.uk)</li>\n</ul>\n", "post_id": 2530, "location": false, "date": "08-10-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>Small, very very beautiful actions creating big change</p>\n", "post_id": 2534, "location": false, "date": "08-10-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<div class=\"wpcom-reblog-snapshot\"> <div class=\"reblog-post\"><p class=\"reblog-from\"><img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/7ae580a21c2ea2986969857845d24932?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />Originally posted on <a href=\"http://waverider1.wordpress.com/2012/08/09/its-time/\">On the Cusp of the Wave</a>:</p><div class=\"reblogged-content\">\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>It\u2019s TIME !

Chris describes them as \u201ca group of people who want to increase food production in the city.\u00a0 We\u2019re still learning and there\u2019s no guarantee that what we\u2019re doing will work, but there\u2019s a real buzz about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>The idea is to provide training and encourage people to think about perhaps becoming commercial food growers themselves.\u00a0 \u201cUrban growing as a career is in its early stages \u2013 it\u2019s still hard work, poorly paid and under-appreciated.\u00a0 But that is changing.\u00a0 I think there\u2019ll be 40 to 50 part time growers on the scene in Manchester within the next four to five years\u201d he predicts.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://helenbabbs.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/manchester-land-army.jpg\"><img title=\"Manchester land army\" src=\"https://helenbabbs.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/manchester-land-army.jpg?w=600&amp;h=400&amp;h=400\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Feeding Manchester</strong></p>\n<p>The Land Army was born out of Feeding Manchester \u2013 a loose network of groups that bond over food.\u00a0 \u201cFood is complicated \u2013 you can\u2019t focus on issues in isolation.\u00a0 We\u2019re taking a holistic approach, sharing and swapping ideas, and working out how we can influence policy.\u00a0 Food is about relationships, trust and getting to know people\u201d says Chris.</p>\n<p>Out west is the <a href=\"http://www.unicorn-grocery.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Unicorn Grocery\u2019s</a> land project, part of the Feeding Manchester network.\u00a0 They have 21 organic acres in an area of peat land that once was full of salad and vegetable crops. Stuart Jones works in both Unicorn\u2019s shop in the city and at the farm in Glazebury.</p>\n<p>\u201cOur soil is great for growing vegetables. We have a six\u00a0year rotation in place including two years fertility building with red clover, white clover and chicory, followed by brassicas, beets, alliums, umbellifers and lettuce.\u00a0 We also have a rotation for overwintering green manures like rye and crimson clover, to keep the soil covered between cropping\u201d says Stuart.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re passionate about producing food in a more sustainable way to feed the city. That means working with nature rather than against it, feeding the soil with good compost, boosting organic matter levels and creating healthy, biologically active soil. There\u2019s plenty of good growing land that could be providing Manchester with veg, but at the moment most comes from Lincolnshire or even Spain.\u201d</p>\n<p>Not wanting to step on anyone\u2019s toes and keen to pool knowledge, Unicorn is part of Manchester Veg People \u2013 a cooperative with buyer and grower members.\u00a0 \u201cWe meet buyers when we are planning our crops and they let us know the quantities they want\u201d explains Stuart.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe growers work out their production costs and then set the prices. We get a fair price and the buyers know they\u2019re supporting a more sustainable way of doing business, sourcing food grown no more than 20 miles from Manchester Town Hall.\u201d</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://helenbabbs.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/manchester-land-army-02.jpg\"><img title=\"Manchester land army 02\" src=\"https://helenbabbs.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/manchester-land-army-02.jpg?w=600&amp;h=400&amp;h=400\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Growing to eat</strong></p>\n<p>\u201cEveryone eats.

A local estate agent has even given them access to space behind a rented property where they\u2019ve planted soft fruit, herbs, salad leaves, various beans and peas.</p>\n<p>Growing often leads to a desire to learn how to cook with homegrown produce, as well as an increased understanding of food related issues.\u00a0 But urban agriculture isn\u2019t just good for the environment \u2013 it\u2019s good for people too.\u00a0 Working the land improves physical and mental wellbeing.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.manchestermind.org/projects/project_bite_index.php\" target=\"_blank\">Bite</a> \u2013 a partnership project between Mind and the Manchester Mental Health and Social Care Trust \u2013 runs five cafes and nine growing projects across the city, as well as an affordable veg bag scheme.\u00a0 Their growing land ranges from allotments to daycentre grounds.</p>\n<p>\u201cFood poverty is a problem here and people might not have the skills or confidence to cook the produce we grow, which is why we also have cafes where people can learn\u201d explains Rowena Pyott from Bite.</p>\n<p>\u201cOur project is also part of Fairshare, which is about using up food waste from supermarkets.\u00a0 So we\u2019re addressing wider issues too, and teaching people about things like food provenance.\u00a0 We\u2019re bringing the sustainable food message to deprived communities who

apple, pear, cherry, plum, damson, gage, nectarine and hazel trees.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.manchesterpermaculturenetwork.org.uk/node/182\" target=\"_blank\">Birchfields Park Forest Garden</a> is also home to raspberries, blackcurrants, redcurrants, gooseberries, jostaberry, logan and tay berry, not to mention gojiberry and blueberry.\u00a0 Species like eleagnus, alder, clover, bird\u2019s foot trefoil, vetch, peas and beans\u00a0have all been included for their nitrogen fixing properties.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe project is about permanence \u2013 we\u2019re demonstrating the potential of forest gardening, complimentary planting and gardening with nature\u201d says forest gardener Jane Morris.\u00a0 \u201cWe want to show that we can have higher yields than monocultures.\u00a0 And that there\u2019s potential for forest gardens in even the smallest of public spaces \u2013 why do we need so much mown grass?</p>\n<p>\u201cUrban growing keeps the activist in me alive\u201d says Jane, who is generally positive about her home town\u2019s food growing credentials.\u00a0 \u201cManchester is proactive, and the Food Futures Strategy is moving us towards a more sustainable food system here.\u201d\u00a0 But there\u2019s work to be done.</p>\n<p>\u201cInner city Manchester is one of the poorest areas in England \u2013 there are huge differences in quality of life and life expectancy.\u00a0 Our project is trying to counteract those inequalities.\u00a0 It\u2019s about improving nutrition, increasing physical activity and also has a therapeutic aspect.Our garden showcases robust and resilient planting, and hopefully is creating robust and resilient communities too.\u201d</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul

Using creative solutions for gardening in small spaces is also a good idea.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>All the gardening suggestions mentioned here will require more research if you wish to apply them. Apartment or condo dwellers may have an edge with some of those creative solutions. They don&#8217;t have neighborhood snitches to call in the local authorities for not having a &#8220;proper&#8221; front lawn.</strong></p>\n<h1><strong>Houses with small yards</strong></h1>\n<p><strong>Here&#8217;s an interesting solution for houses with small yards. Get some water spout troughs used for catching water off roofs and channeling into drain spouts. Fasten them securely to the sunny sides of your house, stacking them vertically.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A few small holes drilled into the bottoms of any planting containers for drainage is a good idea. This method is shown in photos half-way down the &#8220;gardening services&#8221; article linked in the sources below as (1).</strong></p>\n<p><strong>If you&#8217;re renting a house and digging or securing troughs on outer walls is forbidden, you can use containers with soil for planting. You can use stacked tires filled with soil. The excess water goes into the lawn.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The Irish of old survived on potatoes until a fungal blight occurred. The Irish Catholics could only rent small lots from Protestants for crops. Potatoes don&#8217;t need much space and they&#8217;re nutrient-dense. (<a href=\"http://www.naturalnews.com/030359_potatoes_health.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.naturalnews.com/030359_potatoes_health.html</a>)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Potatoes can be cultured in small back yards or large planters. Large planters offer the benefits of no weeding and you can just dump spud crops out instead of digging them out. Details with pictures are in source (2) below.</strong></p>\n<h1><strong>Urban gardening in apartments</strong></h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/assets.inhabitat.com/images/hydroplants.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"452\" height=\"223\" /></p>\n<p><strong>The same water spout troughs used for the side of a house can be suspended in a vertical series from the overhead of your apartment balcony. Three or four or more can be hung, but the suspension materials need to be strong enough to support all the wet soil and the plants.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Source (1) below has photos half way down the article.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A variety of barrels or ready-made large planters with holes in them can provide balcony or small yard planters. Self watering planters use a tube with holes near the bottom to take in water from a hose or a <a href=\"http://www.naturalnews.com/garden.html\">garden</a> watering container to the bottom of the planter&#8217;s soil. The roots suck up the water.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A hole drilled into the upper side warns against too much water by allowing the excess water to spill out. More details with photo here: (<a href=\"http://www.urbanorganicgardener.com/2010/08/how-self-watering-containers-work/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.urbanorganicgardener.com</a>)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Another apartment idea is using large soda or water bottles suspended upside down with the bottoms cut off to hang off of railings or taut clotheslines.

Broccoli sprouts are temperamental, but are the most super of super food sprouts. Sprouts give you more nutrient bang per calorie than other edibles. (<a href=\"http://www.naturalnews.com/029761_sprouting_food_source.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.naturalnews.com/029761_sprouting_food_source.html</a>)</strong></p>\n<h1><strong>General survival advice</strong></h1>\n<p><strong>Most of these small space items will give you some fresh, healthy greens, other veggies, and herbs. Home grown potatoes provide some bulk. But you may have to create and use storage space for dry bin foods while they&#8217;re available.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A closet that is sealed well to keep out rodents and insects would work for storing large amounts of grains, such as brown or basmati rice and <a href=\"http://quinoa.naturalnews.com\">quinoa</a>, and dry legumes such as black beans and garbanzo beans (chick peas). Try to avoid plastic containers.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Rice and beans combined provide all the amino acids needed for forming complete proteins.</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.naturalnews.com/032396_beans_rice.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.naturalnews.com/032396_beans_rice.html</a>)</p>\n<p><strong>Sources for this article include:</strong></p>\n<p>(1) Gardening services <a href=\"http://gardeningservicesauckland.co.nz/\" target=\"_blank\">http://gardeningservicesauckland.co.nz/</a></p>\n<p>(2) <a href=\"http://greenupgrader.com/11708/4-simple-steps-to-grow-a-hundred-pounds-of-potatoes-in-a-barrel/\" target=\"_blank\">http://greenupgrader.com</a></p>\n<p>(3) <a href=\"http://www.motherearthnews.com/city-farming/six-ideas-for-small-space-gardening.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.motherearthnews.com</a></p>\n<p>(4) <a href=\"http://www.hgtv.com/landscaping/edible-gardening-in-small-spaces/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.hgtv.com</a></p>\n<div></div>\n", "post_id": 2569, "location": false, "date": "09-10-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<div class=\"wpcom-reblog-snapshot\"> <div class=\"reblog-post\"><p class=\"reblog-from\"><img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/7ae580a21c2ea2986969857845d24932?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />Originally posted on <a href=\"http://waverider1.wordpress.com/2012/09/10/why-fight-it/\">On the Cusp of the Wave</a>:</p><div class=\"reblogged-content\">\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>Why Fight It?</strong></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"></p>\n\n<p>Why fight it, or dare I ask?</p>\n\n<p>Why fight the urge to merge,</p>\n\n<p>To live, to bask</p>\n\n<p>In Love?</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>Why resist The Call?\u00a0 I wonder. . . .</p>\n\n<p>It builds each day I know</p>\n\n<p>Yet most hit the brakes</p>\n\n<p>Instead of the accelerator</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>Why hold on to fear and \u2018security\u2019?</p>\n\n<p>It makes no sense in the 3D world</p>\n\n<p>Despite the lies your TV blares</p>\n\n<p>LOVE is all you \u2018need\u2019 (I know you\u2019ve heard)!</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>Why fight this global surge of Freedom, of Light?</p>\n\n<p>This wells up within you, you cannot deny it.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s driving them mad, those who suppress it \u2013</p>\n\n<p>Unhealthy at best, tragic consequences manifest.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>Why <em>not</em> wake up?\u00a0 Why <em>not</em> Self-empower?</p>\n\n<p>Believe me you, \u2018tis nigh the hour!</p>\n\n<p>But each makes their own sovereign choice \u2013</p>\n\n<p>And either gives it away, or takes back their power.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>Why fight the urge to live <em>for REAL?</em></p>\n\n<p>Pursue\u2026</p>\n</div><p class=\"reblog-source\"><a href=\"http://waverider1.wordpress.com/2012/09/10/why-fight-it/\">View original</a> <span class=\"more-words\">88 more words</span></p></div></div>", "post_id": 2572, "location": false, "date": "09-11-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["satisfy", "power", "less", "freedom", "sufficient", "within", "ideas", "see", "observe", "wings", "vision", "more"], "text": "<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/less_is_more_v2_by_gawy1.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-2576\" title=\"less_is_more_v2_by_gawy1\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/less_is_more_v2_by_gawy1.jpg?w=672&#038;h=420\" alt=\"\" width=\"672\" height=\"420\" /></a>The things you see from the unshut door,<br />\nThe voices you hear of the cracking floor,<br />\nThe lines you steal in the bright daylight,<br />\nThe masks you wear in the limelight,<br />\nThe time when the day ends at 4,<br />\nLess is more\u2026!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">When living in lies makes you sad,<br />\nAnd snatching the bites hits you bad,<br />\nOn the lane of loneliness when you walk,<br />\nIn the absent tone when you talk,<br />\nOn the way to your answers when you find no door,<br />\nLess is more\u2026!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">When light begins to fade away,<br />\nAnd time makes your actions sway,<br />\nAnd in the lust for freedom, when you exhale,<br />\nLosing all you strength, when you turn pale,<br />\nWhen hope just touches the floor,<br />\nLess is more\u2026!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">The wings of freedom lie still on the floor,<br />\nThe words of wisdom are not used anymore,<br />\nThe source of light is just scattered away,<br />\nThe far-sighted vision is just captured away,<br />\nThe inspiration today remains in a box,<br />\nThe brush of an artist hardy talks,<br />\nEven in this era of highest degree of ignore,<br />\nLess is more\u2026.!</p>\n<p>\u00a9<a href=\"http://varungenius.wordpress.com\">Varun K.

In my own personal experience, when I&#8217;m out of words, that means I&#8217;m pondering on what I&#8217;ve said earlier&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;once again! What&#8217;s the purpose? <em>The words change their incline of meaning every time you read them</em>. Unless you get the same meaning every time you read a statement, you are not really getting it! So, <strong>WHEN WORDS END, MEANINGS BEGIN</strong>. When you are out of words, that means you are pondering on something, said or unsaid.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">This time, PRESENT, is the time of awakening. We all are experiencing changes &#8211; both internal and external. It&#8217;s time to think upon your said words &#8211; what they REALLY mean. You said those words with some purpose of course, but NOW, it&#8217;s time to find the CONNECTION between all those SAID statements of yours! It&#8217;s time for NO WORDS but TRUE MEANINGS.<a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.wordpress.com/2012/12/01/when-words-end-meanings-begin/not-all-words/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-2634\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-2634\" alt=\"not-all-words\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/not-all-words.jpg?w=300&#038;h=300\" height=\"300\" width=\"300\" /></a> It&#8217;s time to search for answers; answers so long hidden in the tricky incline of words. Uncover the opaqueness of those tricky words, make them transparent and look through it. You&#8217;ll find ONE SINGLE TRUTH that connects to every SAID word of yours and magically everything you said starts making SENSE. It&#8217;s time to CHANGE your perspective towards PERCEPTION. How you perceive things around you needs a fresh beginning, a process of re-wiring, re-thinking, re-shaping and re-defining. Don&#8217;t be worried by these heavy words I speak of, they all point towards a single belief &#8211; &#8220;Ending of words doesn&#8217;t mean you are falling, it means you are preparing yourself for the change.&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">My intuition tells me that something BIG is going to happen soon. A SHIFT in our perception and everything connected to it. A SHIFT in CONSCIOUSNESS, to be more precise. People are voluntarily entering into a journey WITHIN themselves. People are becoming more curious in knowing about WHO THEY REALLY ARE!! Words are now scattering, falling apart; they no longer hold the meanings they did earlier. NOW, people are finding courage in challenging even the most unaltered aspects of their life, like religion, lifestyle, career and education. The curiosity to CHANGE is emerging from WITHIN and it&#8217;s a good sign for a new CIVILIZATION to land its first steps on the AWAKENED EARTH.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Whether you post something on this blog or not, there&#8217;s always some CHANGE going on in the background. Sometimes, we have to believe what we can&#8217;t see! <a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.wordpress.com/2012/12/01/when-words-end-meanings-begin/small-words-big-meaning1/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-2635\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-2635 alignleft\" alt=\"small-words-big-meaning1\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/small-words-big-meaning1.jpg?w=300&#038;h=183\" height=\"183\" width=\"300\" /></a>This post was just to remind my fellow authors and bloggers not to worry about going out of words because of lack of time or some other reasons. Because I believe, whether words come out or not, there is always some CHANGE taking place in every part of the universe. Words don&#8217;t change anything, they are lifeless; it&#8217;s their MEANING that makes them alive. You don&#8217;t have to find new words every time; just pick the old ones, change your intention, re-order them, and there you are, with a new MEANING &#8211; a new CREATION of yours!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Happy blogging to all my fellow authors and bloggers! You all are the CHANGE &#8211; MAKERS. Words don&#8217;t define YOU, MEANINGS do!</p>\n<p>\u00a9<a href=\"http://varungenius.com\">Varun K.

Today is <b>21<sup>st</sup> December 2012</b> \u2013 the day of change!! There are many theories that support the fact that TODAY is the doomsday; the end of the world as we know it. But here I am, writing this post on this very day, ALIVE and CONSCIOUS. Not even a scratch magically appeared on my skin, nor did the ground fall beneath my feet. Nothing!!! But something happened; something is about to happen on this day! I\u2019m not concerned about what scientists have to say on the basis of their astronomical observations or what priests have to say on the basis of their faiths and beliefs or what philosophers have to claim about their theories and proofs. I\u2019m simply concerned about what really there is! And that depends upon what I believe because my reality is the result of my beliefs. And in my reality, the PRESENT moment is all that really exists. There is no past, there is no future; these are all the creations of my mind. The reality is NOW!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><i><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.wordpress.com/?attachment_id=2646\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-2646\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-2646 alignright\" alt=\"21-December-2012-THE-END-postnoon-news-435x292\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/21-december-2012-the-end-postnoon-news-435x292.jpg?w=300&#038;h=201\" width=\"300\" height=\"201\" /></a>\u201cAn asteroid, or to be more specific, an unknown planet X is approaching towards earth at very high velocity. And it\u2019s going to strike our planet exactly on 21<sup>st</sup> December 2012. The unexpectedly huge solar activity is going to change or twist the earth\u2019s magnetic field, thereby causing geological shift on our planet; and that too predicted to occur on 21<sup>st</sup> December 2012. Mayan\u2019s calendar clearly shows that the last day of human era is going to be 21<sup>st</sup> December 2012.\u201d</i> And there are many other proofs and evidences that can\u2019t be ignored. All these evidences point towards a single day and a single prediction \u2013 the doomsday! The end of us all!!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">But there\u2019s one good thing that I\u2019ve learned so well in my life till now, and that is <b><i>\u201cto never stop questioning!\u201d</i></b> So here\u2019s my question: <i>\u201cwhat if the interpretations of all these evidences are wrong? Or what if only a few of these evidences are \u2018actually\u2019 interpreted and the rest are just derived from these evidences?\u201d</i></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Well, who knows!!! The stories of finding and collecting the evidences have always been kept secret from us. We just know the HEADLINES that suddenly pop up on our information screens out of nowhere. And then, there are theories, claims, predictions, possibilities, probabilities, news, comments, debates, and all those things that can twist your frame of mind and force you to believe what they want you to! As a part of this world, I have the right to express myself and convey my message to the world.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">The story of doomsday is now a fairy tale, because if it had been true, then you would not have been reading this article. TODAY is the day of change, the day of transformation, the day of a new beginning.

If you take a look around, there is a change going on at all levels. From technology to human behaviour to lifestyle, everything is changing. But TODAY, the energy that controls these changes will shift its level. The energy that binds us and keeps us alive will start vibrating at a higher frequency. And this will lead to changes in behaviour of people. There may or may not be physical or physiological changes at higher level but it is quite expected that there may be transformation of human DNA. The shifting of energy to higher frequency may result in mutation of genes and thus activation of new genes which may lead to change in behaviour, emotions, reactions, thoughts, and therefore the <b><i>consciousness</i></b>. Yes! This is the <b>consciousness shift</b>, not the continental drift! There will not be any displacement of continents, as you are told. This day will bring mark the beginning of an interesting phenomenon \u2013 the shift in consciousness. People will become more aware of their inner and outer worlds. The coming year 2013, will be the year of many small and big changes. You\u2019ll witness the change right in front of you. It\u2019s a <b>mass spiritual awakening</b>. But it will not happen in just one day; it will take time. Love will cover the world with its pure and true colours. This is not something to be expressed in words; you will feel the change as it comes. And it\u2019s coming to you soon enough!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.wordpress.com/?attachment_id=2644\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-2644\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-2644\" alt=\"awakening\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/awakening.jpg?w=113&#038;h=150\" width=\"113\" height=\"150\" /></a>If there are people out there who have already begun experiencing the change, just know that \u201c<i>you are not alone\u201d</i>. There might be strange things happening to you; things you don\u2019t know how to express. Don\u2019t worry; this is just a phase, IT WILL PASS. You are in the phase of spiritual evolution! Be patient and flow with the change.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">On this day, let\u2019s make a resolution to be together in love, to LIVE IN LOVE. If some natural disaster is on its way, and if we can do nothing to prevent it, then it\u2019s better not to think about it and pass every minute in panic and worry.

We are born equipped with talents and abilities but as we grow up and learn to act, we lose our real self. We are taught many things that seem good to others ignoring our own wishes and desires. The things we do should \u2018look good\u2019 to the world and its people; doesn\u2019t matter if we really wish for it or not. At every stage of our life, the people we meet teach us to be formal, not loyal. And if they want us to be loyal, they never mean it in reality; they want us to act like we really want to be loyal. Try remembering any recent decision you made in the past. Just recall the factors you considered while making your past decisions. What was the major factor responsible for making that particular decision? I bet it was \u201cIf I do it this way, how will the people look to it or react to it!\u201d</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">In trying to show others what you possess or what you do, I would say that you never really made any decision for yourself. You made decisions just to ensure that it looks fine when others look at you making that decision. Don\u2019t you think that\u2019s quite unfair to you and unjust to your life! Every system that we have created, teaches us to be an ACTOR; an actor who acts exactly as asked by the system. The rules of this system become our script; the work we do to earn money becomes our dialogue; the formal life we live becomes our story; and just another person like us becomes our director. We are just actors who play various roles in one life story. But even after this busy life, what do we get? Money? Fame? Identity? Is this what we were longing for? Nothing among these is real. Money, fame, identity, these are just illusions; these are our own creations.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">In today\u2019s world, we are told not to believe in just anything or trust just anyone; even our own blood relations. By the time we become independent, we don\u2019t even hesitate to act in front of our own reflection. In order to survive in this fake world, we have to disguise ourselves. We have to tell the world what we are not really inside; just to gain acceptance. But in trying to be the best actor of life, we gradually lose ourselves. We distance our true self from our own conscious; where actually they are one. Right from birth we have been told that we need to act in order to survive and succeed. Diplomacy and formalities become our life.<br />\nYou may wish for many things that you actually desire, but you can\u2019t have it; because it may look odd or strange to others. You are bound by rules, laws, principles, guidelines and restrictions. You wish for freedom but you can\u2019t actually have it; because you have to pretend that you are fine with what you have. Just for a minute, stop and reflect your past. What have you gained? What have you lost? And what haven\u2019t you explored yet? It seems like we are all actors and in our whole lifetime we learn to perfect this art of acting. We are living a life with multiple roles and none of them is our real one!<br />\nFor just once, think and reflect where have you been? What were you searching for? All this time you were living in a dream. You were acting on someone\u2019s commands. You were following someone\u2019s orders. You were not YOU! Now it\u2019s time to be what you always wanted to be! It is my belief that we are what we believe ourselves to be. Our physical bodies are just an illusion. It\u2019s just a vessel that we have created by our own imagination and the wonderful power of perception. We mould our physical bodies with our thoughts and efforts. In reality, we are not even inside our physical bodies at all. We actually reside in an unknown dimension where we all are ONE. The absolute world to which we belong knows no dualities; it stands entirely on ONENESS. We don\u2019t have to pretend to be someone else; we don\u2019t have to impress anyone; we don\u2019t have to live in disguise anymore; we don\u2019t have to hide our true faces. We have to be what we really are \u2013 our real self; away from these world\u2019s formalities and restrictions.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">To conclude, I would say, <strong>\u201cIf you want to be an actor, better be the one whose character reflects your true style. Every one of us has a different story to live but many common roles to play; doesn\u2019t matter who plays them well, what really matters is how well you stood on your expectations and how balanced were you on the grounds of self-satisfaction.\u201d</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a9<a href=\"http://varungenius.com\">Varun K.

I did that too, many times but now I wonder\u00a0<b>what the\u2026\u2026.point</b>\u00a0behind doing all that is! You all know that cursing the situation or the person will never solve your problem; it\u2019s just a way to escape the frustration and anger. In most of the cases, situations may even go worse after you curse! \u00a0Sometimes, we say bad words just for fun; we simply laugh at them and enjoy. Enjoying is good, laughing is even better but are there no other matters left to laugh at than just enjoying at such filthy words?</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/5012589_f520.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image\" id=\"i-2679\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/5012589_f520.jpg?w=510\" /></a></p>\n<p><i>I lost my keys! What the %$#!</i></p>\n<p><i>I am late for the meeting! What the\u00a0<i>%$#!</i></i></p>\n<p><i>Why can\u2019t I do it better? I\u2019m such an *$%#*@!</i></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Situations may or may not be in your favour but there seems no point in cursing the situation by using such words which not only sound uncomfortable but also take away a part of you. For some people, words are just words. It hardly matters for them what they say. For others, words are like arrows; once shot, they create an impact. But a person is better judged by his words; \u2018<b>choice of words\u2019</b>\u00a0to be more precise. Not every one of you may have excellent writing or communication skills or vocabulary but you can certainly become good in communication, if not excellent; and\u00a0<b>good</b>\u00a0is all that is needed.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">It\u2019s not necessary that a person who has poor choice of words can never be a good person. Actions always speak louder than words. But being good in words and the manner we speak opens a window of our true character to others. Therefore, others can see you as you really are! Being good to others is appreciable but good things start with good ideas, and to share your ideas while keeping their quality intact, your words should be acceptable too. Speaking those filthy words that may affect the sphere around you will do nothing good to you too! So, speak well, be good, be YOU!</p>\n", "post_id": 2680, "location": false, "date": "06-03-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<div class=\"wpcom-reblog-snapshot\"> <div class=\"reblog-post\"><p class=\"reblog-from\"><img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/7ae580a21c2ea2986969857845d24932?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />Originally posted on <a href=\"http://waverider1.wordpress.com/2013/06/20/food-for-thought-what-is-real/\">On the Cusp of the Wave</a>:</p><div class=\"reblogged-content\">\n<p>It\u2019s fascinating, don\u2019t you think, when after a few tumultuous years of life in this crazy world one looks back at how we were \u2018raised\u2019 and educated.\u00a0 We begin to see things that may have never occurred to us before as being intriguing, or even worth thinking about.\u00a0 The concept of \u2018reality\u2019 is one of those little things that has piqued my curiosity of late.</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"attachment_480\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://waverider1.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/cloudship-in-sunset-w-shadow-and-trail.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-480\" src=\"http://waverider1.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/cloudship-in-sunset-w-shadow-and-trail.jpg?w=300&#038;h=191\" height=\"191\" width=\"300\" alt=\"Cloudship in Sunset w Shadow and Trail\"></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">\u2018Anomaly\u2019 in the clouds at sunset</p></div>\n\n\n<p>You see, intrinsic in the traditional definition of what is \u2018real\u2019 \u2014 versus what would come under the heading \u2018just your imagination\u2019 (which is a loaded phrase in and of itself \u2014 I mean, why <em>just</em>?) \u2014 is the clear assumption that something can only be real if (a) it exists <em>outside </em>of oneself, completely independent in a physical sense from your own body (with the obvious exception <em>of</em> your own body, of course); (b) it also exists\u2026</p>\n</div><p class=\"reblog-source\"><a href=\"http://waverider1.wordpress.com/2013/06/20/food-for-thought-what-is-real/\">View original</a> <span class=\"more-words\">256 more words</span></p></div></div>", "post_id": 2686, "location": false, "date": "06-20-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<div class=\"wpcom-reblog-snapshot\"><div class=\"reblogger-note\"><p class=\"reblogger-headline\"><img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/7ae580a21c2ea2986969857845d24932?s=32&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-32' height='32' width='32' /><a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.wordpress.com/author/waverider1/\">Waverider1</a>:</p><div class='reblogger-note-content'><blockquote><p>I reblog this compelling message due to its &#8216;timely&#8217; content, and to encourage all of you to &#8216;join in this uplifting choir of human voices that is already singing along with that beautiful tune of the heavens above and the Earth below.&#8217;</p>\n</blockquote></div></div><div class=\"reblog-post\"><p class=\"reblog-from\"><img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/3dec73625726e5104a927815054e1c4f?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />Originally posted on <a href=\"http://aishanorth.wordpress.com/2013/09/07/the-manuscript-of-survival-part-351/\">aisha north</a>:</p><div class=\"reblogged-content\">\n<p>As you have been made more than aware of lately, the winds of change have not abated, and neither are they about to.

Events like, losing someone so close to you, falling sick with some serious disease, unexpected loss of money or property or shares, repeated events that make you sad, loss of faith in anything that exists, sudden ignorance by friends and colleagues, etc. Whatever may be the reason, the result is <b>this question, with no answer!</b></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">So, what should you <b>believe</b> in? And more important than that, is it really so important to believe in something? And what if we simply move on without believing in anything? Or what if we believe in everything that comes our way?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Well, these questions seem <b>absurd</b> and not quite important to answer. But these are the questions, the answers of which will help you to <b>know</b> what you should <b>believe</b> in! So, is it really <b>necessary</b> to believe in something? Well, I would say YES! <b>A life without belief can\u2019t exist! </b>Everyone needs a <b>direction</b>! Imagine a scenario when you have nothing to believe in! You won\u2019t believe in anything and so, you can\u2019t <b>express</b> your <b>ideas</b> and therefore, you can\u2019t act as well. Can you imagine your <b>life without action</b>? NEVER!!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Now, what if you believe in everything that comes your way! According to me, that\u2019s not possible because you can\u2019t proceed in a single direction (towards your goal or desire) with scattered thoughts. So now, you are left with just one question: <b>What should you believe in, if you have to?</b> The answer to this question lies in a very valuable realization which says: <i>\u201c<b>You perceive that you believe and you believe that you perceive!\u201d</b></i> This is the cycle of truth.</p>\n<p>\u00a0<a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/new-bitmap-image1.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2690\" alt=\"New Bitmap Image1\" src=\"https://alternateeconomy.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/new-bitmap-image1.jpg?w=575&#038;h=337\" width=\"575\" height=\"337\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">When you <b>believe</b> in something, you <b>perceive</b> it. For example, you believe in <b>GOD</b>, so you perceive the results from his <b>worship</b>; you believe in <b>happiness</b>, so you get it; you believe in <b>dreams</b>, so you have it; you believe in <b>hard work</b>, so you act upon it; you believe in <b>knowledge</b>, so you know it. The journey from <b>belief</b> (that is in mind) to <b>perception</b> (that is in reality) is known as <b>manifestation</b>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">When you <b>perceive</b> something, you <b>believe</b> in it. That\u2019s because you sense it, so you believe in it! But this can lead to some <b>doubts and misinterpretations</b> as well because not everything that you sense is actually real. Sometimes, your senses may fool you! Therefore, the journey from <b>perception </b>(that is in reality) to <b>belief </b>(that is in mind) is known as <b>realization</b>. Therefore, in order to believe in what you perceive, you don\u2019t just have to <b>observe</b> it, you have to <b>realize</b> it!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">In order to understand the <b>depth of reality</b> a thing holds, you have to perceive it deeply with <b>details</b>. For example, what do you understand by a wooden table? It\u2019s a flat wooden slab supported by four or more legs and it is <b>solid</b>. Now, a tricky question: <b>Do you perceive it as a table, that\u2019s why you believe it to be a table OR Do you believe it to be a table, that\u2019s why you perceive it as a table?</b> In simple words, <b>which thought comes first \u2013 Believing it as a table, or perceiving it as table?</b> It may seem like it doesn\u2019t really matter in this case because whether you perceive first or believe first, the <b>table is a table!</b></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">But think about bigger things and more important things connected to your <b>life</b>. When you want to <b>achieve</b> something, you have to <b>believe</b> first that <b>it is already yours</b>. Then, with time and effort, your achievement becomes your reality; which means you can now perceive it! So, belief turned into perception, that\u2019s manifestation. In this case, <b>belief comes first</b>!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">You perceive many things around you almost every instant. Some of them are a result of your own beliefs, as I said earlier (i.e. manifestations) while many others do exist even if you do or don\u2019t believe in them. For such things, which exist even without you believing in them, you <b>learn</b> from them, <b>understand</b> them, <b>observe</b> their <b>details</b>, <b>analyse</b> them with <b>reason</b> and <b>logic</b>, learn their <b>pattern</b> and so you <b>BELIEVE</b> in them. Perception turned into a belief (or set of beliefs), that\u2019s realization. In this case, <b>perception comes first!</b></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">When you create things out of your imagination and project them into the real world where you can actually perceive it, then you are creating your own reality from your own will. And when you understand and learn from things around you and develop a belief about its existence, then you are realizing a truth about the world you live in.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">So, if you have a <b>dream</b> to achieve, start believing in it; it will soon turn into your <b>reality</b>. And if you want to <b>know</b> about the <b>unknown</b>, start realizing the <b>truths</b>; because <b>life circles around manifestations and realizations</b>. And once you are aware of which of the two is currently going on in your world, then you are <b>enlightened</b> with the answer. That means, you know where you stand, <b>what should you believe in</b>, and whether your perception is a truth or another <b>illusion</b>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><b><i><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">You create, you perceive; you perceive, you believe; and you believe, you create! </span></i></b></p>\n<p>\u00a9 <a href=\"www.varungenius.com\">Varun K.

I have no doubt that the Alternate Economy will succeed.  The Age of Aquarius is upon us.  I do not care if my version of the Alternate Economy is the one that succeeds.

I do not need the confidence boost (although it is nice&#8230;)  I ask you to share Love for the sake of Love.  If we can all join together in one &#8220;room&#8221; we CAN make a difference.

I know that you know many people who will love these ideas as much as you do.  Bring them in to our love.  Share with them the gift of Hope.  The gift of a better future.  </p>\n<p>I am not claiming to have all the answers, but together I know we will find them!</p>\n<p>I am ready to live in love.  But I am not the only one!

One of the first things she noticed was the large number of homeless people, and this shocked her so much that she decided to actually do something about it. She had always believed the homeless didn\u2019t need actual money to be accepted back into society, only a chance to empower themselves by making themselves useful, so she opened a Tauschring (swap shop), called \u201cGib und Nimm\u201d (Give and Take).</p>\n<p>Her small venture was a place where anyone could trade stuff and skills for other things and skills they needed, without a single coin or banknote changing hands. Old clothes could be traded in return for kitchen appliances, and car service rendered in return for plumbing services, and so on. The idea didn\u2019t really attract many of Dortmund\u2019s homeless, because, as some of them told her to her face, they didn\u2019t feel an educated middle-class woman could relate to their situation. Instead, her small shop was assaulted by many of the city\u2019s unemployed and retired folk eager to trade their skills and old stuff for something they needed. Heidemarie Schwermer\u2019s Tauschring eventually became somewhat of a phenomenon in Dortmund and even prompted its creator to ask herself some questions about the life she was living.</p>\n<p>She started to realize she was living with a lot of stuff she didn\u2019t really need and initially decided not to buy anything else without giving something away. Then she realized how unhappy she was with her work and made the connection between this feeling and the physical symptoms (backache and constant illness) she was feeling, so she decided to take up other jobs. She began washing dishes for 10 Deutchmarks an hour, and despite many were telling her things like \u201cYou went to university, you studied to do this?\u201d, she felt good about herself, and didn\u2019t feel like she should be valued more because of her studies than someone working in a kitchen. By 1995, the Tauschring had changed her life so much that she was spending virtually nothing, as everything she needed seemed to find its way into her life.</p>\n<p>So in 1996. she took the biggest decision of her life: to live without money. Her children had moved out so she sold the apartment in Dortmund and decided to live nomadically, trading things and services for everything she needed. It was supposed to be a 12-month experiment, but found herself loving it so much that she just couldn\u2019t give it up. 15 years later, she still lives according to the principles of Gib und Nimm, doing various chores for accommodation in the houses of various members of the Tauschring, and loving every minute of it. Schwermer has written two books about her experience of living without money and asked her publisher to give the money to charity so it can make many people happy instead of just one. She\u2019s just happy being healthier and better off than ever before.</p>\n<p>All of her belongings fit into a single-back suitcase and a rucksack, she has emergency savings of \u20ac200 and any other money she comes across, she gives away. Heidemarie doesn\u2019t even have health insurance as she didn\u2019t want to be accused of stealing from the state, and says she relies on the power of self-healing whenever she gets a little sick.</p>\n", "post_id": 383, "location": false, "date": "01-09-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["emotion", "alternate", "love", "cancer", "unemployment", "age of aquarius", "universal", "testing", "idea", "currency", "gemini", "thanks", "selfishness", "alternative", "education", "employment", "fear", "happiness", "astrology", "gratitude", "selfish", "inheritance", "hate", "discussion", "give", "writing", "write", "writer", "book", "passion", "economy", "greatness", "remorse", "hope", "2012", "prose", "absolute truth", "compassion", "joy", "aquarius", "judgement", "protection", "imagine", "law", "security", "bank", "loss", "novel", "forum", "banking", "receive", "science", "foolishness", "conversation", "resources", "truth", "universe", "religion", "hatred", "balance", "greed", "generosity"], "text": "<p>My blog has received the honour of being one of the\u00a0first blogs to be awarded with the Hope Unites Globally &#8211; HUG Award.\u00a0 Many thanks to Connie Wayne and her dedication to the spread of awareness and hope through positive actions!</p>\n<p>Please, visit her blog, <a href=\"http://ahopefortoday.com/\">http://ahopefortoday.com/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wp.me/p1MMZi-FU\">Hope Unites Globally &#8211; HUG Award Guidelines</a>.</p>\n", "post_id": 442, "location": false, "date": "01-14-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["emotion", "alternate", "love", "cancer", "unemployment", "age of aquarius", "universal", "testing", "idea", "currency", "gemini", "thanks", "selfishness", "alternative", "education", "employment", "fear", "happiness", "astrology", "gratitude", "selfish", "inheritance", "hate", "discussion", "give", "writing", "write", "writer", "book", "passion", "economy", "greatness", "remorse", "hope", "2012", "prose", "absolute truth", "compassion", "joy", "aquarius", "judgement", "protection", "imagine", "law", "security", "bank", "loss", "novel", "forum", "banking", "receive", "science", "foolishness", "conversation", "resources", "truth", "universe", "religion", "hatred", "balance", "greed", "generosity"], "text": "<p><strong>The following is a Guest Post from one of the Alternate Economy&#8217;s Newest Members.\u00a0 Our first aim is to create a discussion.\u00a0 By talking about how we can make this a reality, we will make this a reality.\u00a0 Please visit <a href=\"http://mindmindful.wordpress.com/2011/11/20/aspiration-right-effort/\">http://mindmindful.wordpress.com/2011/11/20/aspiration-right-effort/</a>\u00a0to see her blog.</strong></p>\n<p><em></em></p>\n<p><em>The world needs dreamers and the world needs doers.

You are exactly what I have been seeking, though I don&#8217;t know if I could&#8217;ve described it. I feel privileged &amp; graced to be able to become a part of The Alternate Economy &#8212; what a grand social &amp; economic experiment! ((I use the word &#8216;experiment&#8217; because I feel that there will be enough varied creativity among the 250,000+ to be able to adjust, readjust, etc to everything that comes our way.)) Plus, I need help in being a &#8220;doer&#8221;, so I&#8217;m counting on y&#8217;all!! haha</p>\n<p>Anyway, I did a bit of investigating online and I found this economic analysis of the competiveness of the barge industry on the Mississippi River, from 2005.\u00a0 Tristan had challenged me to come up with some information on the transportation system after I had mentioned that river access for intracontinental shipping is important.\u00a0\u00a0The article\u00a0is examining the question, &#8220;Perfectly Competitive or Oligopolistic?&#8221; (say THAT 5 times fast, haha) in order to determine whether public funding assumptions are working out. THAT&#8217;S not why I think this is interesting for the Alternate Economy, though.</p>\n<p>I think this study is illustrative of some of the issues involved in getting into an industry &amp; working within it.\u00a0 (I use this example, because I am the one who mentioned barges &amp; the Port of Catoosa, near Tulsa, OK, USA.) So, peruse this, if you will; the salient points are highlighted. THEN, there are some comments &amp; observations following&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. This study is in econ-speak, &amp; is a bit dry. So, I abstracted the major points.</p>\n<p>*** &#8220;Oligopolistic&#8221; (for those who don&#8217;t know; I had to look it up!!) means a few entities own &amp; control most of an industry. They are not perfectly competitive, but rather work in tandem to further secure their hold on the industry. The media, telecom, corporate agriculture etc are good examples.***</p>\n<p>*****************************************************************************************************************************************************</p>\n<p>&#8220;The Mississippi River System Barge Industry \u2013 Perfectly Competitive or Oligopolistic?&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.waterprotectionnetwork.org/sitepages/downloads/ProjectsInTheField-Reports/BargeIndustry-PerfectCompetitionorOligopoly.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.waterprotectionnetwork.org/sitepages/downloads/ProjectsInTheField-Reports/BargeIndustry-PerfectCompetitionorOligopoly.pdf</a></p>\n<p>ANALYSIS</p>\n<p>\u2022 the dry cargo (grain) barge industry on the Mississippi River in\u00a02005\u00a0was considered to be\u00a0tightly to moderately oligopolistic</p>\n<p>\u2022 the liquid cargo barge industry &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..\u00a0\u00a0tightly oligopolistic</p>\n<p>\u2022 5 companies own 86% of total number of barges operating on the Mississppi River</p>\n<p>\u2022 the barge industry\u00a0has become\u00a0more concentrated than in the study from the 1970&#8217;s</p>\n<p>\u2022 at 2 different periods, a large over-production of barges occurred (based on projections that didn&#8217;t pan out) &amp; there were only the existing barge companies to buy them &#8212;&#8211;&gt; ability to get into the industry &amp; capacity for existing companies to expand/contract is restricted</p>\n<p>\u2022 ethanol production has reduced\u00a0 farm product shipment downriver (primarily corn &amp; soybeans); these commodities are used in upriver ethanol production &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;&gt; market conditions favor increased concentration\u00a0in the barge industry</p>\n<p>\u2022 the number of barge companies declined; the size of remaining companies increased</p>\n<p>\u2022 it is projected in 2005 that the capacity of the barge industry will continue to decline</p>\n<p>\u2022 as number of barges &amp; barge firms declined, barge rates increased sharply; this is offset slightly by increased fuel costs</p>\n<p>\u2022 market is non-competitive (NOT increasing number of barges as rates increase)</p>\n<p>\u2022 it is estimated that fleets will continue to decline, as barges age out of their economic life (c 30 yrs) BARRIERS TO ENTRY</p>\n<p>\u2022 there are/will be fewer &amp; larger customers (consolidation) in order to keep up w/large geographical outreach needed</p>\n<p>\u2022 &#8220;It is no longer possible to buy a $200,000 used barge, and with free access to the river, compete successfully with the large integrated barge firms dealing with large integrated customers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>VERTICAL INTEGRATION</p>\n<p>\u2022 controlling raw material supplies &amp; shipping to optimize prices &amp; profits in the marketing chain</p>\n<p>\u2022 forward &amp; backward integration &#8212; buying/controlling the raw supplies &amp; the making/selling/use of the barges, the subsidiary services (stevedoring, storage, etc) &amp; the carrying capacity</p>\n<p>\u2022this kind of consolidation further increases barriers to entry into the industry</p>\n<p>*****************************************************************************************************************************************************</p>\n<p>Now, again, this is just illustrative of what it might mean to be involved in any industry, &amp; work within it. And here are some things to think about:</p>\n<p>\u2022 This analysis is specific to a particular industry, related to a\u00a0particular question. But, many industries are highly concentrated like this. I&#8217;m thinking especially of the media/communication industry &#8211;&gt; so many newspapers, radio stations, magazines, etc with fewer &amp; fewer owners. (As I&#8217;m sure y&#8217;all know, this warps, constrains, slants the message coming from them.)</p>\n<p>\u2022 Barriers to being competitive within any of these oligopolistic industries are high.</p>\n<p>\u2022 As others in AltEcon have mentioned, owning SHARES of companies, &amp; especially majority shareholdings, probably will allow us to exert our ideas, wishes, aims most effectively within these big industries&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..</p>\n<p>\u2022 We want to invest in our own small businesses too, right?</p>\n<p>\u2022 And in the industries in between?</p>\n<p><strong>Multiple strategies are best:</strong></p>\n<p>\u2022 We would need a team or department of the bank to investigate, research, manage, etc all investment opportunities &#8212; in the large, oligopolistic industries, &amp; in the small biz start ups, &amp; all the things in between.</p>\n<p>\u2022 (((FYI, being an angel investor is MY personal dream (see my blog post <a href=\"http://wp.me/p1zocx-vn\" rel=\"nofollow nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://wp.me/p1zocx-vn</a>))).</p>\n<p>\u2022 I have no doubt that AltEcon will attract many kinds of people, with many kinds of skills, with many kinds of experiences. We will need some of them to be banking, finance, investment sorts &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; In the U.S., this is &#8220;Wall Street&#8221;, &amp; &#8211;esp. right now! &#8212; is not well thought of. Surely, though, some of those wheeler dealers want to use their skills for something other than soul-sucking greed! Such abilities &amp; knowledge will be needed in our economy of generosity &amp; love &#8212; these are specialized, somewhat esoteric skill sets.</p>\n<p>Just some thoughts&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;</p>\n<p>- by: Shala Blackburn</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://mindmindful.wordpress.com/\">http://mindmindful.wordpress.com/</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "post_id": 445, "location": false, "date": "01-14-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["emotion", "alternate", "love", "cancer", "unemployment", "age of aquarius", "universal", "testing", "idea", "currency", "gemini", "thanks", "selfishness", "alternative", "education", "employment", "fear", "happiness", "astrology", "gratitude", "selfish", "inheritance", "hate", "discussion", "give", "writing", "write", "writer", "book", "passion", "economy", "greatness", "remorse", "hope", "2012", "prose", "absolute truth", "compassion", "joy", "aquarius", "judgement", "protection", "imagine", "law", "security", "bank", "loss", "novel", "forum", "banking", "receive", "science", "foolishness", "conversation", "resources", "truth", "universe", "religion", "hatred", "balance", "greed", "generosity"], "text": "<p>I keep saying that there exists one truth on this planet, and if we can come to understand that one truth we will be able to create a Utopia quite easily.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://rubbertramping.wordpress.com/2012/01/06/the-remainder-of-california/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/i1230.photobucket.com/albums/ee496/oshinnreid/IMG_9000.jpg\" alt=\"Love is a journey\" width=\"450/\" /></a><br />\n<a href=\"http://rubbertramping.wordpress.com/\">Photo by: Oshinn Reid</a></p>\n<p>The Truth that I keep speaking of is that the Idea of Love is best expressed with Balanced Emotions.  Please note that whenever I write this sentence I always capitalize the key words.  These words represent essential thoughts in our Universe that we must explore in order to gain knowledge.</p>\n<p>But what does this mean?  The Idea of Love is best expressed with Balanced Emotions?  If we balance our emotions we are able to see that love is good, love is easy, love is beautiful, love is coming, love is given freely and love is everyone&#8217;s.  Even as you read this list you know that it is true.  Love is all of those things and nothing more.</p>\n<p>But even when I read this list, there is one element that causes me to hesitate.  Sure love is good and love is beautiful.  That much is obvious.  Love is given freely and love is everyone&#8217;s should be obvious, but it doesn&#8217;t hurt to say it out loud once in a while.  Love is coming&#8230;  this one will seem accurate to the optimists in the crowd, but maybe not the pessimists.  Love is easy.  Now this is the tough one.  Even for the optimists, there is very little evidence that this particular statement is true.  I would say that the last two are related and the reason love does not seem to be easy, is because we are not so great at receiving love.  Love is coming seems like a nice thing, but how many of us truly believe it to be true?  If love is not coming, then it will never be easy.</p>\n<p>So, how do I know deep down in my soul that love is actually easy, when my entire life&#8217;s experiences have shown me the opposite?</p>\n<p>Love is easy; life is hard.  There is a subtle distinction between these two thoughts.  I believe the reason love appears to be hard in our current society is because life is hard.  We currently live in a cycle of abuse 6,000 years old.  Our entire written history contains stories of slavery, murder, rape, deceipt, war and revenge.  6,000 years later love appears to be incredibly hard.  But is love itself hard?  Or are the people engaging in love hard?</p>\n<p>I would say that it is the cycle of abuse that we have been born into that makes love hard.  We are literally told from birth by our parents, friends, lovers, news outlets, popular music, movies and every other form of communication in our lives that love is hard.  People lie, cheat and are selfish.  No matter what they tell you even if they themselves believe it to be true, they are deceiving you, for in reality it is only themselves that they are thinking about.  Is this true?  It seems to be.  People lie, cheat and act very selfishly.  Most of the time.  In my life, it happens pretty much every time I extend my love to someone.  So why does this happen, if love is so easy?</p>\n<p>Imagine now that you are having one idea reinforced in your mind since birth.  This idea is that all people are selfish.  You can only rely on yourself in this life, or else you will end up suffering.  This is the story most of us are familiar with.  In fact most of us have told others this advice and felt we were helping them to avoid further suffering in the future.</p>\n<p>Wrong!</p>\n<p>By hearing this story, over and over and over and over we do not become wise and learn about true human nature.  We become jaded and distrustful of everyone around us.  We become selfish.  If everyone else is only looking out for themselves, then that is what we will do.  Now, it only takes one example of someone else acting selfishly towards us and we will be justified to never trust in humanity ever again.  We were warned not to trust, and it was confirmed.  But they were also warned the same thing.  Maybe they are a bit older, or received their confirmation of this warning earlier in life.  Either way, they are selfish for the same reason you are.  Because they expect everyone else to be selfish.</p>\n<p>Love is easy.  It is.  Humans are trustworthy.  We are.  I am.  Ask around.  I have broken peoples trust in the past.  But I have appologized and made efforts to avoid breaking it in the future.  Assuming that person will allow me to make up for my mistake.  If I make a mistake and my loved one sees this as justification to stop trusting me forever, then I will lose that person.  And I will suffer.  And love will seem so hard.  Even though I am the one who made the mistake, I am not the only one.  Now the lover rejecting me is making a mistake.  They do not believe I am sincere when I say I want to change.  But I am sincere.  How can I prove this if I am not given another chance?</p>\n<p>Love is hard because we are always pulling away from it at the slightest provocation.  It doesn&#8217;t take much these days to push someone away.  We are so senstive, because we have been hurt so many times in the past.  But it is all from the cycle of abuse that started 6,000 years ago.  IT IS NO ONES FAULT!  Seriously. No one currently alive is to blame for this mess.  This isn&#8217;t Hitler&#8217;s fault, or Stalin&#8217;s.  This isn&#8217;t George. W&#8217;s fault or Obama&#8217;s.  This isn&#8217;t your fault or mine.</p>\n<p>The reason love is hard is because we all act in a way to make it hard.  If we all just stopped.</p>\n<p>Just stop.</p>\n<p>Really stop.  And remember that whatever situation is presenting itself to you that love is good, love is easy, love is beautiful, love is coming, love is given freely and love is everyone&#8217;s.  If you can do this, every single time something happens in your life, then love will be easy.  It is easy.  What is hard about it?  You just have to love&#8230;</p>\n<p>Since I have started doing this; remembering that love is good, love is easy, love is beautiful, love is coming, love is given freely and love is everyone&#8217;s, I have seen huge changes in my life.  Not really in the amount of love I receive.  The others in my life who are wounded are still wounded and still refuse to allow me into their lives.  The changes are the ones I feel within me.  I feel like I am love.  I feel like I am creating love in those around me.  A different group of &#8220;those&#8221;.  I am using love to create and inspire.  All I have done is write down my thoughts and then take the time to visit other peoples blogs.  Nothing more.  And the response to this blog has been tremendous.  In the past couple of days I have not really posted anything or visited any new blogs. Yet my membership still grows while I sleep.  I am at 275 followers since I decided that love is good, love is easy, love is beautiful, love is coming, love is given freely and love is everyone&#8217;s; only 2 and a half weeks ago.</p>\n<p>Love is easy.</p>\n<p>If you are willing to be patient and to understand that those who reject you do not do so because love is hard.  They do so because they are wounded from the cycle of abuse and you have given them cause to retreat in fear.  It usually only takes one or two excuses before they pack their bags.  I wonder, do you do the same?  Do you wait for the excuse and then run out the door, swearing and screaming?  Do you distrust your loved ones?  Do you push them to get a rise out of them?  Do you ask questions you know that you don&#8217;t want to hear the answer to?  Do you keep secrets from them?  Do you look at others with lust?  Do you make mistakes?  Do you think your lover is any different than you?</p>\n<p>Love is easy.  Life is hard.</p>\n<p>If we can move past the cycle of abuse that is life and begin to live in a cycle that perpetuates love, it will be so easy.  I am doing it alone, and it is pretty easy.  I would love to see what 250,000 people living together and living in love and remembering that love is good, love is easy, love is beautiful, love is coming, love is given freely and love is everyone&#8217;s could do!</p>\n", "post_id": 449, "location": false, "date": "01-18-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["emotion", "alternate", "love", "cancer", "unemployment", "age of aquarius", "universal", "testing", "idea", "currency", "gemini", "thanks", "selfishness", "alternative", "education", "employment", "fear", "happiness", "astrology", "gratitude", "selfish", "inheritance", "hate", "discussion", "give", "writing", "write", "writer", "book", "passion", "economy", "greatness", "remorse", "hope", "2012", "prose", "absolute truth", "compassion", "joy", "aquarius", "judgement", "protection", "imagine", "law", "security", "bank", "loss", "novel", "forum", "banking", "receive", "science", "foolishness", "conversation", "resources", "truth", "universe", "religion", "hatred", "balance", "greed", "generosity"], "text": "<p>At the Alternate Economy our main goal of forming a bank is to allow us to begin puchasing resources. Below is a sample of what some of my proposals to the community will look like. Each proposal should have three main areas, outlined in as much detail as possible.</p>\n<p>1: Costs<br />\n2: Business Plan for Sustainability<br />\n3: Benefits to Community</p>\n<p>This proposal is only an example, we still need to form a bank before we start worrying about actual details. I have chosen a real site that is really for sale right now, to base this operation on. This proposal is researched and presents the costs as best as I can determine them without actually calling these people up and bothering them.</p>\n<p><strong>Glass Resource Proposal</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Costs</strong></p>\n<p>$17,500,000<br />\nA little over half of one months budget for our community</p>\n<p>This proposal will contain 8 parts:</p>\n<p>- Silica Mining Reserve &#8211; $4,500,000<br />\n&#8211; Limestone Mining Reserve &#8211; $1,500,000<br />\n&#8211; Sodium Carbonate Distillery &#8211; $1,500,000<br />\n&#8211; Component Processing Plant &#8211; $3,500,000<br />\n&#8211; Glass Manufaturing Factory &#8211; $1,500,000<br />\n&#8211; Greenhouse Production Factory &#8211; $500,000<br />\n&#8211; Trucking Company &#8211; $1,000,000<br />\n&#8211; Housing Initiative &#8211; $3,500,000</p>\n<p><strong>Silica Mining Reserve </strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.silica-ore.com/Quartz-Mountain/quartz-mtn2.jpg\" alt=\"Silica Mine\" /><br />\nSilica Mine</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.silica-ore.com/quartz-mountain.html\">Quartz Mountain</a>, the unique silica mine in Douglas County, Oregon, is for sale. This property includes the mountain top silica quarry located on 4 patented claims (82.592 acres, title to be issued soon) and 5 adjoining unpatented claims (103 acres) in the Umpqua National Forest.</p>\n<p>The deposit is approximately 3000 feet by 1200 and 700 feet deep; purity is 98+%. A major glass producer initiated exploratory drilling to confirm quantity and quality of reserves to support a flat glass plant to be located in the Roseburg area in 1999. This independent drilling has confirmed reserves in excess of 4.5 million tons and indicated reserves over 10 million tons, more than sufficient for their needs. Estimates of total reserves of the massive deposit have ranged to 103 million tons, though drilling has not been done to confirm this number.</p>\n<p>There is no overburden on the quarry site and very little vegetation. The mine road is in good condition and will accommodate semi-trucks with trailers.</p>\n<p><strong>Limestone Mining Reserve </strong></p>\n<p>It would be wise to search for a limestone quarry near the silica quarry.  Limestone is far more plentiful and more reasonably priced, so it is easier to match the location of limestone to that of the silica.  Since glass requires 75% silica 10% limestone and 15% sodium carbonate, we will need to harvest all three resources in order to produce glass.</p>\n<p>There is a beautiful property in <a>Oregon</a> available for sale. The owner of this exceptional property seeks a conservation buyer for purchase.  It\u2019s 642 acres of timber land and a limestone quarry. However, it\u2019s what lies beneath that makes the property so exceptional. The land lies on one of Oregon\u2019s largest limestone deposits. Underground, a complex cave is associated with this limestone deposit.</p>\n<p>Based on a 1995 survey, it has over a quarter-mile in total lineal feet of cave length. The entrance to the cave is blocked to prevent unwanted entry and was last opened in 2010, when the owner let a cave conservancy group in to survey, photograph, and explore the cave. The group discovered a family of spiders that was previously unknown and un-cataloged!</p>\n<p>Of the 642 acres, about 40 acres has been historically used as a limestone quarry (unused since the 1960\u2019s). The balance of the property is timberland, well stocked with young conifers approaching marketable size. The property features home site opportunities and panoramic views of the Wilderville and Grants Pass area. It is located near the Rogue and Applegate Rivers and contains a seasonal creek.</p>\n<p>It is currently listed for sale at $1,495,000.</p>\n<p><strong>Sodium Carbonate Distillery </strong></p>\n<p>Sodium Carbonate is an essential component to glass production. It is added as a flux to reduce the melting temperature of silica from 1700 F to 900 F. This greatly lowers the cost of production of glass. But also weakens the glass, so limestone is needed as well, to strengthen the mixture. Sodium Carbonate is made by processing brine (Sodium Chloride and water) with Ammonia in special towers. These towers do not use up the ammonia, but simply require brine and limestone to create sodium carbonate. The waste product of this process, calcium chloride, can be used in secondary applications, such as a desiccant to store foods and a safer(?) alternative for road de-icing.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.bombayharbor.com/productImage/0717105001299634437/Sodium_Carbonate.jpg\" alt=\"Sodium Carbonate\" /><br />\nSodium Carbonate</p>\n<p><strong>Component Processing Plant </strong></p>\n<p>I feel the best solution for component processing would be to build a factory on the property. The first stage of silica and limestone processing is grinding the stone into a fine powder. There are mobile grinders available to do the coarse grinding and these machines are available used. They are quite expensive and will probably run around $1,000,000 for two of them. This machine can move around the sand pit, and will dump its production into dump trucks to haul back to the processing plant. The processing plant will essentially be a shell containing two more grinders, to get the sand as fine as possible, and a furnace. The stage where the sand is heated up is called &#8220;washing&#8221;, and requires the sand to be floated in water to separate the impurities. Sodium Carbonate is added as a flux in order to reduce the temperatures for melting. It is then heated and melted and rolled into panes of glass. These panes of glass can be loaded onto flatbed trucks and moved to the glass manufacturing factory,</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.sbmcn.com/images/solution.jpg\" alt=\"Silica coarse gravel crusher\" /><br />\nSilica coarse gravel crusher</p>\n<p><strong>Glass Manufaturing Factory</strong></p>\n<p>Since this property is almost 200 acres in size, it would be wise to build this fatory here as well. We can easily build a shell for $500,000 and fill it with equipment from other companies that are for sale. A large scale factory in British Columbia is for sale for $1,125,000. After shipping costs and assembly we should be able to have a glass manufacturing plant quite easily. This plant will be able to automatically make windows, doors, double-paned glass or anything else we need, using the panes of glass produced at the silica processing plant.</p>\n<p><strong>Greenhouse Production Factory</strong></p>\n<p>This factory will not need to be as large, and will essentially be a space for craftsmen to construct simple greenhouses from the windows provided to them by the automated machinery in the glass production factory. Costs will be negligable and sales will be important early on to help propel the project forward.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.floriangreenhouse.com/1pictures/genevanewjearsey.jpg\" alt=\"Greenhouses\" /><br />\nGreenhouse Production</p>\n<p><strong>Trucking Company</strong></p>\n<p>In several steps I have refered to the need for transport trailers to carry loads from one location to another. We will also need a transport to deliver our goods to retailers and other areas where they are needed within the community. I recommend 4 trucks to start. 2 dump trucks, and 2 truck cabs. The three hitches to go along with the 2 18 wheelers would include one flatbed and two boxed cars. A second boxed car attachment would be wise, in case we have large orders or orders in opposite directions. The flatbed truck can be used to transport raw glass panes. With these four trucks we can easily keep up with demand for distribution of our products.</p>\n<p><strong>Housing Initiative</strong></p>\n<p>Since we have 800+ acres with road access and wooded lots on two properties, it would make sense to sever off a section of 5 acres or so which is relatively secluded and create a housing initiative for our employees. All employees will be hired from within the pool of 250,000 members and so they should be housed as part of their labour contract. They will each receive a single detached home of about 1800 sq ft with 3 bedrooms and one bathroom. This should cost the community around $100,000 a home to build. The home and the land it is sitting upon will become the employees personal property. It cannot be sold without permission of the community, but it cannot be confiscated either. It can be traded for other homes within the community, but must stay within the community at all times. If the member decides to leave the community, they lose their right to ownership of the home.</p>\n<p><strong>Business Plan</strong></p>\n<p>The goal of this project is to secure all of the necessary resources required for the production of finished windows and glass products.  To do this we will need to operate two quarries on two separate properties.  Both properties will be in Oregon, but they will need to be connected by a system of transport.  We will also need transportation for delivery of the final products.  By building three factories upon the site where the silica is located, we will be able to refine the glass, manufacture it into windows and even create greenhouses for our agricultural sector.  This will, of course, all require money.  Money to purchase and money to maintain.  In order for this project to benefit our community it must at least break even.  We do not want to introduce projects that drain the community of funds, especially near the beginning.  If we are able to produce glass in excess, so that our production costs are met, and we still have some left over to use in the community, we will be in the best position. </p>\n<p>Costs: (approximate)</p>\n<p>Downpayment &#8211; $1,750,000<br />\nLoan from our Bank &#8211; $15,750,000</p>\n<p>Loan Repayments<br />\n&#8211; Fed Rate = 0.75%<br />\n                &#8211; Our Rate = 1.00%<br />\n                &#8211; Term = 25 years<br />\n                &#8211; $59,500/month</p>\n<p>Property Taxes &#8211; $5,100/month</p>\n<p>Salaries<br />\n&#8211; 32 x $5,000/month<br />\n&#8211; $160,000/month</p>\n<p>Electricity &#8211; $30,000/month (?)</p>\n<p>Fuel &#8211; $50,000/month (?)</p>\n<p>Salt &#8211; $1,000/month (?)

The output capacity of this silica reserve far exceeds the needs of 250,000 people. 4.5 million tonnes of silica (the very low estimate) is enough to make 6 million tonnes of glass. That is a lot. More than enough to get us started and still have some to trade.</p>\n<p><strong>Residual Businesses</strong></p>\n<p>The production of Glass requires coarse gravel limestone and silica, the excess of which can be sold to other producers. The by product of sodium carbonate production, calcium chloride, is a salt that can also be sold to various industries. The raw glass panes, 16&#8242; x 10&#8242;, can be used to make just about anything in our factory, using automated machinery. Any excess in production can be sold to construction companies to help keep this business afloat. Also, there is the Greenhouse production factory. Many of the greenhouses will be kept to increase the yields of our farmers, but many can be sold as well, to raise funds to purchase more land, etc. Finally, the Limestone quarry is sitting on 600+ acres, which includes an incredible cave complex. We could easily section off the cave area and create a spelunking adventure retreat.</p>\n<p><strong>Environmental Protection</strong></p>\n<p>We can go to lengths to ensure the land surrounding the quarries is maintained in harmony with the environment. I am not aware of a way of creating glass without having sand pits of some size. But that does not mean we need to destroy all the surrounding lands. We can easily harvest the pre-existing pits, and put money back into the surrounding lands. We can plant trees, and section off areas for wilderness reserves. We can invest in preservation of the natural caves found at the limestone quarry. We can do whatever we want to, once the land is ours.</p>\n<p><strong>Employment</strong><br />\n32 employees</p>\n<p>4 Truck Drivers<br />\n8 Sand Pit Machinery Operators<br />\n3 Maintenance Engineers<br />\n2 Foremen to run Sodium Carbonate Distillery<br />\n6 Foremen to run Silica Processing Plant<br />\n4 Foremen to run Glass Manufacturing Factory<br />\n1 Salesman for Glass Manufacturing Factory<br />\n2 Craftsmen to construct Greenhouses<br />\n1 Salesman for Greenhouse Production Factory<br />\n1 Accountant</p>\n<p>All employees receive free housing that they own from that point forward, assuming they remain members of the community. If they leave their post, they lose their title to their land. All employees will be paid $60,000 a year on top of their housing.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>By agreeing to invest $1,750,000 of our community&#8217;s money (a little over a half of a month of saving for 250,000 people) into the glass resource package we are providing access to windows, raw glass panes, finished greenhouses, limestone gravel and calcium chloride.  We are creating a stream of income for our community to help secure new resources and we are enabling our construction sector to save money by providing them with free windows.  We are providing perpetual employment and housing for 32 of our members and we are creating a 600 acre nature reserve which centers around a natural limestone cave.</p>\n<p>By taking control of the harvesting of resources we can manage how they are collected.  We can utilize the pre-existing sand pits and conserve all of the land around it.  We can take from the surface that is already exposed and plant trees in all the other areas.  We can invest in technologies that will help to reduce our footprint, once the companies are up and running and bringing in an income.</p>\n<p>Please, take the time to consider this proposal as if it were real.

I designed airline routes for North America, vast star colony trading routes, new vehicles, farming communites, and much more all before the age of 10.<br />\n4) My family used to think I was a little bit weird and would tease me about my lists, innocently of course.<br />\n5) I remember reading Buddhist texts that my mother owned as a small child and closing them with a bit of confusion.  Nothing in there seemed all that complicated or new to me.  I remember thinking to myself that I would quite easily become a Buddha in this life.<br />\n6) I have always had a strong feeling that magic does exist, we have simply forgotten how to use it.  I look forward to one day walking on water with you!<br />\n7) I have vivid dreams almost every night, but do not keep a dream log yet.  I should, and will probably start soon.  Some of them are incredible metaphoric and would be interesting additions to this blog.</p>\n<p>As for my Nominations, I will start with 3:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://akissofbliss.wordpress.com/\">A Kiss of Bliss</a></p>\n<p>This blog puts forward ideas of compassion and hope in the attempt to bring humanity together in Love.

Look at the clouds trying to cover the<br />\nblue,<br />\nInvading the light with it\u2019s heavy black<br />\ncrew,<br />\nBut there\u2019s something inside that<br />\nfierceful roar, That speaks to us and shows us the<br />\ndoor,<br />\nIn every drop of rain there is<br />\nsomething we see,<br />\nThat reflects our vision and sets us<br />\nfree. Feel the air that is always around,<br />\nComing close to ears and buzzing a<br />\nsound,<br />\nThere\u2019s something inside this<br />\ndisturbing chime,<br />\nThat changes these sounds into words of rhyme,<br />\nIn every breeze there is something we<br />\nhear,<br />\nThat recites a poem of the life we bear.

What is listening?  It is one thing to hear what someone says to you, but it is quite another to listen to it.</p>\n<p>Listening implies that we take what someone has said and we begin to digest it.  We analyze the various layers that the idea presented to us contains.  We look to the person saying the things and to what we know about them.  We use our knowledge about their situation and their past to try and gain a better idea of their perspective.  We use our knowledge about the person not to create assumptions, but rather to strip them away.  As we uncover the other&#8217;s perspective, we begin to see how they have reached their conclusion.  Now we can begin to analyze the statement.  We are free of assumptions and have arrived at the problem from a new-found perspective.  Now you can weigh this perspective against your own.</p>\n<p>The funny thing about truly listening is that we find that neither perspective is truly wrong.  It is simply that, a perspective.  When we slip into the other&#8217;s shoes and truly listen to what they are saying and where they are saying it from, we can see their point.</p>\n<p>Now the tricky part.  When we truly listen, we see that every problem has many sides and many perspectives.  But only one Truth.  The Truth is that our Universe is a spectacular place filled with infinite perspectives, all of which are valid.  The Truth is that Balance arrives from investigating every problem from every perspective.  When we are able to do this, we see that the answer is never in the extreme.  The answer lies in the middle.  No one side of the problem is right, no one perspective superior.  The answer is always found somewhere in the middle.</p>\n<p>I am curious, what does purple look like to you?  Does it look the same to you as it does to me?  Probably not.

I will not help you to find Joy by telling you what it is.  I will help you find Joy by listening to what you think it is.</p>\n<p>I am ready to listen.  But remember, I have a perspective too.

How could someone still love me if I break their trust. If I lie to them and cheat? If I look at others with desire? If I abuse them and ignore them and hurt their feelings? How could anyone still love me after all of that?</p>\n<p>Unconditional love is rare, I will not deny that, but it does exist. Unconditional love is not something that we earn, however. Unconditional love arrives when the person engaging in it comes to a realization. The person engaging in unconditional love realizes that they love themself. They realize that they are good, they are easy to get along with and that they are beautiful. So they extend their love in a way so that it is always coming, always given freely and always given to everyone.</p>\n<p>Unconditional love does not require the person being loved to live in love. It requires the person doing the loving to live in love. When the person doing the loving lives in love, they are confident in themselves and in their capacity to love. So they do not take offense when someone they love makes a mistake. They see it for what it is; a mistake. When we are love, we cannot be hurt by something so small as a mistake. No matter how large that mistake may seem. For all mistakes are in fact lessons. When we are love we grow stronger with every mistake, because we are able to learn through awareness of the cause and effect of our contributions to our loved ones mistakes. We are all connected and it takes two to tango. If our loved one makes a mistake, we are there to help them through it, no matter what it is.</p>\n<p>Unconditional love is simply that; love without any conditions. It is true love. There is, in fact, no other kind of love. Desire, and passion and lust are not true forms of love. They imply a dependence on our lover. Unconditional love implies that we are a continuous source of support for our lover. If they need a shoulder to cry on, we provide it. If they need an ear to bitch into, we provide that. If they need some space, we will give them space. If they need something new, we will go looking for it together. If they need to try other lovers, we will allow them to. If they need a hug, we will give them one. When we live in love and are able to love unconditionally, we see that it is not about what we need. What do we need, really? We need more love. When we are love, that is all we really desire. More love. In order for us to increase the love in our life, we must be willing to provide whatever our lover needs. We undersatnd that by giving our love freely we will receive it infinitely. Love is not exclusive. It is very much inclusive. If our lover needs us, we are they. If our lover needs us to wait, we will do that too.</p>\n<p>But why? Why allow our lover everything? How does that benefit us in the end? In the end we realize that we do not have just the one lover anymore. In our world today, lovers come into our lives for periods of time. They enter your life in a swirl of emotion and the beginning is always exciting. It is a new love and we want to investigate it. In our world today, when this initial excitement wears off, often times the lover leaves our lives again in another swirl of emotion, this time usually negative. Imagine now if in your life you only had lovers entering it, and never leaving. Imagine if you had a collection of lovers, and added to it throughout time. Once we love unconditionally, we are able to forgive our lover any transgression. They can lie to us, and cheat on us and ask us to disappear forever. But when we love unconditionally we know that emotions are not permanent. But love is. Emotions change through time. Maybe it will take a month for your lover to cool off. Maybe a year. Maybe ten years. But eventually the emotions will fade away and be forgotten. Love does not fade away. When we live in love we know that eventually our lover will forget their negative emotions. Assuming we continuously extend our love, they will eventually return it.</p>\n<p>But in the meantime we meet more people and create more love. We are love, so we have no problem finding it. While our lover is off &#8220;finding themselves&#8221; we are content to do the same. We take on new lovers and start the cycle over again, all the while extending love to our previous lovers regardless of our success. Eventually, through time, we will develop a collection of lovers. Not all of them will return to us. But some will. And the ones that do will most likely be the ones that are now able to live in love and love unconditionally as well. By never giving up on our lovers, we ensure that we never close the door. Maybe our lover will choose never to step back through that door. But maybe they will. And when they do, we will be one lover richer. Because we have not spent the time in betwen pinning for our lover. We have spent it investing in even more love with others. Love is everyone&#8217;s. And we know it. When we extend our love to our previous lover, it is not in the attempt to return to something old. It is in the attempt to create something new. If our lover wishes to return to us, they will have to accept that we have found new lovers along the way. But they will come to understand that when we love unconditionally we do not love any one person more than any other. We love all of our loved ones equally. </p>\n<p>I have used the word lover, because I speak of love, but I hope you understand what I mean by this word. A lover is someone we share our love with, not our bodies. Sometimes sharing our love means sharing our body, when our lover feels like sharing themselves that way. When we are love, we are confident in our body and willing to share it with anyone who does not abuse it. But when we are love we also know that having a lover does not mean we need to share our bodies with them. We can have many lovers at once and share our bodies with the ones that are comfortable with that, and keep our bodies to ourselves when we are with the lovers that are not comfortable with that. When we love unconditionally, we are happy either way. We are looking for love, not physical contact. That is why we can balance many lovers at once. Because we only share our bodies with the ones who want us to, yet we share our love with all.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, if you are loved unconditionally, it is not because of something you did or because the person loving you thinks you are superior to the other lovers in their life. If you are loved unconditionally it is because you are incredibly lucky to have met someone who lives in love.</p>\n", "post_id": 619, "location": false, "date": "01-27-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["emotion", "love", "thanks", "selfishness", "alternative", "hate", "fear", "happiness", "gratitude", "selfish", "inheritance", "alternate", "remorse", "passion", "hope", "economy", "compassion", "joy", "judgement", "loss", "generosity", "hatred", "balance", "greed"], "text": "<p>In our galaxy today, it would seem that Balance is the ultimate concept.

Balance even exists before Love.</p>\n<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='420' height='315' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/xoMAZG7O3wQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span>\n<p>&nbsp;<br />\nIn order for us to understand love we must first experience balance. Love is ultimately a form of balanced emotions. Love is expressed in many ways, but all of them require the caveat of balance. Love is balanced communication. Love is balanced sexuality. Love is balanced passions. Love is balanced happiness. Love is balanced.</p>\n<p>But the same cannot really be said for balance. A balanced checkbook does not require love. Nor does the balance of day and night. One would imagine that before the concept of love, there existed day and night. A balanced human requires love, but now we are talking about something more. Love is at the conscious level. But balance is at the essential level.</p>\n<p>Once we understand balance, then we can begin to explore the concept of love.</p>\n<p>I would propose that we do understand balance. Quite well. Balance is the joining of two equal and opposite expressions to form one perfect whole. Love, when expressed in its healthiest form, is balanced. Love can and usually is expressed in its wounded form. But as we begin to investigate love more closely, we will find that all of the wounded forms exist when there is an imbalance.</p>\n<p>Balance leads to health, just as imbalance leads to woundedness. This applies to more than just love. When we have a chemical imbalance our bodies suffer. When we have a financial imbalance our credit suffers. When we have an emotional imbalance our ability to love suffers. The road to healing the aspects of love is always by balancing them.</p>\n<p>Read Next:</p>\n<table width=\"250\" border=\"1\" bgcolor=\"#99ccff\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.wordpress.com/2012/01/16/love-2/\">Love</a>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.alternate-economy.com\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.alternate-economy.com/Images/banner-alternate-economy.jpg\" alt=\"The Alternate Economy\" width=\"450\"></a></p>\n", "post_id": 62, "location": false, "date": "12-09-2011", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["emotion", "love", "cancer", "give", "age of aquarius", "universal", "idea", "currency", "gemini", "moral", "thanks", "selfishness", "alternative", "education", "employment", "fear", "happiness", "astrology", "gratitude", "selfish", "inheritance", "justice", "hate", "discussion", "alternate", "religion", "remorse", "economy", "greatness", "passion", "hope", "2012", "unemployment", "absolute truth", "compassion", "joy", "aquarius", "judgement", "protection", "imagine", "law", "security", "morality", "loss", "forum", "receive", "science", "foolishness", "conversation", "truth", "universe", "hatred", "balance", "greed", "generosity"], "text": "<p>One week ago I posted the first (of many) sample proposal to the community.

I actually really enjoy this activity, because it allows me a few moments alone to prepare for the day.  Plus, I am always amazed at how easy it is to keep a public restroom clean.  Granted, our customers are what would normally be referred to as the upper class, but they are still bathrooms, and they are rarely dirty at all.  With five minutes and a windex bottle, I am able to have them sparkling.  The worst case scenario I have to unplug a toilet which takes about 45 seconds and one hand washing.  But I am getting off topic.</p>\n<p>Yesterday as I was windexing the mirror I was looking at myself.  I noticed how incredibly pronounced my dimples are when I smile.  Sometimes when I start to smile at myself in the mirror I cannot help but smile more and more until I look like a bloody fool.  But I have to say I love my smile.  After my eyes, it is my favourite part about myself.  Combined with my eyes, I feel it is a tool that could potentially change the world.</p>\n<p>And then I noticed it.  For the first time.  A wrinkle.  As I stood there smiling at myself like an idiot, I saw it.  And it brought a mist to my eyes.  For the wrinkle was right there on top of my dimple, creasing upwards towards my nose.  It seems my smiling has paid off.  It is true what they say when you are a child.  If you make a face enough times, it will get stuck that way.  Mine is stuck in a smile.  My wrinkle is the proof.</p>\n<p>I will be turning 30 this year in 2012, and I have to say, I cannot wait.  I am very excited about this year and what it has to offer.  I am ready for what the world has to offer me.  Whatever I am confronted with I will remember that love is good, love is easy, love is beautiful, love is coming, love is given freely and love is everyone&#8217;s and I will smile through it.</p>\n", "post_id": 653, "location": false, "date": "01-31-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["emotion", "love", "cancer", "give", "age of aquarius", "universal", "idea", "currency", "gemini", "moral", "thanks", "selfishness", "alternative", "education", "employment", "fear", "happiness", "astrology", "gratitude", "selfish", "inheritance", "justice", "hate", "discussion", "alternate", "religion", "remorse", "economy", "greatness", "passion", "hope", "2012", "unemployment", "absolute truth", "compassion", "joy", "aquarius", "judgement", "protection", "imagine", "law", "security", "morality", "loss", "forum", "receive", "science", "foolishness", "conversation", "truth", "universe", "hatred", "balance", "greed", "generosity"], "text": "<p>It is amazing how when we meet someone new that we feel an attraction to, we immediately begin to act in a certain way.  When we see someone just as a potential friend, we usually just let go and be ourselves.  That is why we are so comfortable with our true friends.  With them we can be ourselves, in woundedness and in health, and we know that they will not judge us.</p>\n<p>When we feel an attraction to someone new we do not act the same way.  We immediately move in upon ourselves in doubt.  We do not let go and be ourselves.  We hold on and guard what we say and how we act in front of our new attraction until we are able to determine their wounds.  When we feel attracted to someone we immediately begin to fear losing them.  Since romantic relationships are so rare and difficult to create, when we see a potential lover we are very careful not to blow it.</p>\n<p>So we wait.  We let them talk.  We try to answer in ways that they will want to hear.  We evaluate how they would like their potential lover to look, and then we copy that.  We look for signs of their past wounds so that we can be empathetic towards it.  Sometimes we look for their past wounds so that we can manipulate them.  If we know that our potential lover does not like being treated in a certain way, we will tell them that we also do not like that.  We mould our personality to something we think they will approve of and then we make our move.</p>\n<p>But what has happened here?  We have entered the relationship expecting for there to be many variables.  We know that most people are wounded, so we have waited for the wounds to appear and then we have adapted ourselves to show that we are the solution to these wounds.  But eventually, for a relationship to work, you have to become friends.  Friends are not afraid to be themselves.  They let go and are comfortable just being who they are.  </p>\n<p>If we started the relationship by adapting our personality to one which we felt would be most accepted by our lover, then how can we now begin to act like ourselves?  How do we become friends?  If we start to just act like ourself, our lover will begin to notice that we have changed.  This usually is not a good thing, because our lover has trusted us to be exactly as we presented ourselves.  So instead we continue to adapt our personality in order to keep our lover around.  But this is usually not a good thing either, because now we are no longer free to be ourselves.</p>\n<p>In the end, the relationship will fail, because we have introduced so many variables right from the start.  By assuming everyone loves differently, we have come into the relationship looking for the variables and adapting ourselves to them.  But this strategy cannot be maintained for long.  Because sooner or later our true self must be exposed.</p>\n<p>Love has no variables.  That is why it is so easy.  We attach variables through our expectations of loss. Because we see so little success in love, we guard our true selves when engaging in it, in the hopes that we will convince someone to love us.  It is this act that creates so many variables in love.  Because we are rarely that good at figuring out other peoples wounds.  Wounds are very personal.  When we try to adapt ourselves to what we think our lover wants, we are rarely doing that good of a job at it.  Add to that the fact that it is not how we truly feel, despite our intentions we will not succeed.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://rubbertramping.wordpress.com/2011/11/18/kalispell/\"><img src=\"https://rubbertramping.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/img_6999.jpg?w=700&amp;h=466\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\"></a><br />\n<a href=\"http://rubbertramping.wordpress.com/\">Photo by: Oshinn Reid</a></p>\n<p>Love is easy because it has no variables.

It means truly being there, in the moment, with your lover.  Whatever your lover requires, you are there for them.  But you are always presenting your true self.  You have opinions and wounds of your own.  You will not be taken advantage of, but you will not take advantage of their trust either.  You are honest and sincere and present in the moment.  You are listening and engaging and making them think.  You are asking questions and reaching out and touching their hearts.  You are stroking their back and holding their hand and helping them jump over a puddle.  You are there when they call, and willing to give them space.  We all need space.  In love there are no variables.  In woundedness there are many variables.  It is our wounds which make love so hard.  Love itself is easy.  So incredibly easy.

It is thought of to the point of obsession by nearly all mankind, yet how many people truly understand what love is? When I look around the world I see some acts done with love, but my overwhelming sense is that most acts are done out of insecurity, fear and selfishness. How can it be that as a society we talk of nothing but love yet still fail to act in a loving way to one another? We know deep down to our core that love exists and that we have experienced it. Even if it only lasted the briefest of seconds, once it has been experienced it is never forgotten and forever sought after. So what is Love?</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.alternate-economy.com/Images/love1.jpg\" alt=\"Love\" width=\"350\"></p>\n<p>Before we try to understand what love is, perhaps we should discuss in more depth what it is not. Love is not an emotion. Emotions are impermanent and tightly linked to the ego. Emotions quickly change as new information becomes available and is processed. The most powerful emotions tend to spring forth when you have the least understanding about a situation. Love, however, is a constant that starts as just a hint and grows only if it is nurtured. Love is the root of all emotions, not the other way around. When we truly look at the emotions we will see that none of them would exist without first experiencing love. Anger exists when something we love is threatened. Hatred exists when something we love is taken from us. Hope exists when something we love begins to take shape. Happiness exists when something we love is present. But all forms of emotion first require love to exist.</p>\n<p>Love is not desire, for desire is a selfish act. Desire is looking at a person to see what you can get from them to further your own needs. Often desire is rooted in lust, but it can come from other needs as well. We also desire a sense of security, a better life, someone to nurture, or someone we can walk all over. But in the end all of these desires come from a sense of emptiness inside that needs to be filled. Love is looking at a person to see what you can give to them to help them along their journey. It pours out of you when you see an opportunity to improve another&#8217;s life, so it cannot be desire.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.alternate-economy.com/Images/love2.jpg\" alt=\"Love\" width=\"350\"></p>\n<p>Love is not passion, for passion is an uncontrolled fervour. Passion is looking at a person through a lens and only seeing the aspects of them that we are interested in seeing. It places a person on a pedestal. It is an overwhelmingly emotional experience, which leads it to be easily confused with love. Its flames burn out quickly as your delusions about the other person become apparent, though. All of a sudden they cannot compare to the perfect partner you have created in your passion. There is no truth in passion, so it cannot be love</p>\n<p>Finally, love is not sex, for sex is merely a physical act, albeit one which results in the formation of life. Sex is a powerful, emotionally connecting moment between two people and can certainly result in an experience of love, but it is equally a powerful tool for destruction and pain. Sex can certainly exist without love, as love can exist without sex. In fact most of the loving relationships in our lives have zero sexuality. Family, friends, pets all exist in your life quite lovingly without sex. Yet there is a very strong sentiment that your sexual partner is the &#8216;True Love&#8217; in your life. I disagree. There is simply so much stigma attached to sex that culture dictates we engage in it with a single person for the majority of our lives. But how natural is this practice? Now when you stop feeling sexually attracted to your partner you assume that you no longer love them. It may not even be true that you have stopped being sexually attracted to your current partner, it is more likely that you are simply attracted to another person as well. Perhaps you are just acting like every other animal in nature and exploring your sexuality with multiple partners. Why does this mean that your loving relationship with your current partner has to end? We feel betrayed when our lover shows interest in another sexually, yet how many of us can say that we never do the same? Until we can accept the reality of our sexuality, we will continue to confuse it with love.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.alternate-economy.com/Images/love3.jpg\" alt=\"Love\" width=\"350\"></p>\n<p>So what is Love? When have we experienced it in the past? How can we recognize it in the future? We must remember that love is simply an interaction. Love is the sharing of a powerful experience between two or more souls that leads to truth. Love is walking down a dirt path on a fall day. The air is crisp, but your jacket is cozy. The leaves are turning beautiful shades of yellow and red. Coming towards you on the path is a father with his two year old daughter on his shoulders, piggy-backing. As they bounce past the daughter looks you straight in the eyes and lets out a loud screech of laughter, her face exploding into a toothy smile as yours does the same. A chuckle bursts from your lips as your eyes descend to the father\u2019s and you see his face aglow as well. The feeling that washes over all of you at that moment; that is love. The connection made with the laughing child and her father, two strangers who you will most likely never meet again, is a moment you will remember. The child has seen that an enthusiastic laugh and smile will bring the same out in a stranger, the father has seen how the innocence of a child can bring together previously unknown people and you have learned to appreciate every bounce along the path of life. All three have grown, all three have participated in a beautiful moment. All three have loved.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.alternate-economy.com/Images/love4.jpg\" alt=\"Love\" width=\"350\"></p>\n<p>If we want to enter a realm of higher thinking, in an attempt to break love down into its simplest form, then I would imagine the definition for love would be that it is. I think you will find upon deep introspection and analysis of the experiences in your life that they all break down to variations of the same thing: Love. The confusion in our assessment of love, I am convinced, is simply one of misplaced labelling when one experiences a connection to love. Love is the lesson. It is the core, the root, the essence. All things in our solar system arise from infinite, minute variations upon the same theme: Love. Because love is it, when we catch a glimpse of it we become filled with a sense of awe, wonder and happiness. But this is also where the confusion enters. For we associate the emotions of happiness and bliss that arise from love as being love, but this is not the case. Love is the lesson, learned. Love is what arises when another step down the path towards Truth has been taken.</p>\n<p>Many people go through life looking for \u2018the One\u2019 that they will fall in love with and live with in eternal bliss. This mindset, that there is only one person out there in the midst of six billion who can satisfy you and make you complete, is one of gross ignorance. By thinking in this way we set ourselves the task of searching for love, or worse still, waiting for love. In both cases, when someone does meet another person that they have a close connection to, instead of nurturing their shared happiness, each person begins to categorize their partner. In an attempt to decide whether or not this person is \u2018the One\u2019 they rate various attributes about their partner, judging and measuring them against their own lifestyle. Never making compromises, but instead seeing how the other person fits into their rigid idea of the perfect relationship. The problem with this way of thinking is that no one will ever fit, and no partner will ever be \u2018the One\u2019 because no person is perfect. We all have bad habits and imperfections. But if we are constantly critiquing our partners we are sure to notice every imperfection. And with time these imperfections will begin to grate upon our nerves. Our original feeling of love towards this person is being replaced by annoyance. Perhaps, also, because our original feeling of love was actually lust, which wears off relatively quickly. All in all our relationship is doomed to failure because we are waiting for love to happen, or searching for love so furiously that we instead uncover all our lover\u2019s imperfections.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.alternate-economy.com/Images/img - alt2.jpg\" alt=\"Love\" width=\"350\"></p>\n<p>How can this be avoided? Wise men have said that love can be found between any two people, and I tend to agree. All that must be remembered is that love is not something that arrives, or something that needs to be found. Love is something that is created. When two people who share something special decide that they want to engage in a loving relationship and they make the effort together to create love between one another, then it cannot fail. But both parties must understand that love is a journey with ups and downs. Love is multi-faceted and is expressed in many ways, some unpleasant, but all of which need to be experienced. The \u2018perfect\u2019 relationship is one where two souls are content to share the majority of their experiences in this life together, so they can compare notes, reminisce about past shared experiences and learn from one another as they grow.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.alternate-economy.com/Images/Img - 9.jpg\" alt=\"Love\" width=\"350\"></p>\n<p>True love is about balance. It would also seem that love it tightly linked to emotion. Whenever we experience love we are filled with emotions, be they good or bad. Perhaps the proper way to achieve love is to balance our emotions. If we are able to express our emotions in a way that perpetuates love, rather than impeding it, then we will be in a position to love infinitely. Love is infinite. In order to ever experience this, however, we must first balance our emotions.</p>\n<p>Read Next:</p>\n<table width=\"250\" border=\"1\" bgcolor=\"#99ccff\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://alternateeconomy.wordpress.com/2011/12/12/emotion/\">Emotion</a>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.alternate-economy.com\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.alternate-economy.com/Images/banner-alternate-economy.jpg\" alt=\"The Alternate Economy\" width=\"450\"></a></p>\n", "post_id": 68, "location": false, "date": "01-16-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["emotion", "love", "cancer", "give", "age of aquarius", "universal", "gemini", "selfishness", "alternative", "hate", "fear", "happiness", "astrology", "gratitude", "selfish", "inheritance", "alternate", "religion", "remorse", "greatness", "passion", "hope", "economy", "compassion", "joy", "aquarius", "judgement", "protection", "imagine", "security", "loss", "receive", "science", "foolishness", "generosity", "truth", "universe", "hatred", "balance", "greed"], "text": "<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em>This poem was written by one of my blogging friends.

Below is a sample of what some of my proposals to the community will look like. Each proposal should have three main areas, outlined in as much detail as possible.</p>\n<p>1: Costs<br />\n2: Business Plan for Sustainability<br />\n3: Benefits to Community</p>\n<p>This proposal is only an example, we still need to form a bank before we start worrying about actual details. </p>\n<p><strong>Perpetual Housing Package</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Costs</strong></p>\n<p>$25,000,000<br />\nOne months budget for our community</p>\n<p>This proposal will contain 2 parts:</p>\n<p>- Income Housing Initiative &#8211; $12,500,000<br />\n&#8211; Community Housing Initiative &#8211; $12,500,000</p>\n<p><strong>Income Housing Initiative</strong></p>\n<p>This is, in my opinion, an ingenious design that allows our community to put in motion a home-building machine that literally funds itself and creates perpetual free housing for our members. Current data for construction costs of a single family home put it in the region of $150,000 a unit. For homes that share a building, such as semi-detached houses or condos, the construction cost tends to be closer to $100,000. Regardless of the cost, the interesting thing about the real estate market is that new houses generally sell for around twice their cost to produce. By keeping our costs low (which will be easier if we decide to purchase a construction company and certain resources such as lumber, cement and steel production) the community will be able to offer affordable housing to non-members. We can then use the income generated from selling this housing and reinvest it back into the project. By never removing any money from the machine and ensuring that we sell enough houses to remain just slightly in the black, we can literally build free homes for our members forever. It will be a slow process, but within 15 to 20 years the majority of our community should be housed freely.</p>\n<p>The idea is simple.  For every house we build and sell, we will generate enough income to build two new houses.  When we build the two new houses, we keep one for our members and sell the other.  The sale of this home allows us to build two more houses.  By always keeping one and selling the other, we are able to create housing to infinity.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/homevoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/minimalist-eco-friendly-home-design.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\"></p>\n<p>The housing we sell to non-members can be scattered around the globe, in various hotspots for building.  We can ensure that our homes are low cost yet still environmentally friendly.  By building in multiple locations we will ensure the profitabilty of this program.  The housing we build for ourselves will be permanent additions to our community, so we may find they cost a little more to produce.  We might need to sell two homes for every one we keep, but in the end, as long as we manage our money efficiently and continue to acquire new resources (which will ultimately lower construction costs) we should have no issues creating free housing for ourselves.  It will mean building 6 or 700,000 houses, but it will also mean that our entire community is housed for free.</p>\n<p><strong>Community Housing Initiative</strong></p>\n<p>The Perpetual Housing Machine works by purchasing several large tracts of land for non-member housing and building housing for the community on a different location.  The way I envision this system working is that we buy one large piece of land somewhere central, that is easy to access and has a decent number of natural resources.  We will establish our community housing on this piece of property.  All housing built here will be given to community members, for free, on a lottery system.  It would be wise to invest in other production such as agriculture in this area as well.  If our community members will be living here, there must be something for them to do.  This housing initiative should be planned as small villages and cities, using the most current green technologies and sustainable designs.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.watch-documentaries-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/nuvali-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\"></p>\n<p>By skimming off the top of the income generating housing initiative, our communities can be built however we want them to be, with no investment from us other than our labour and ideas.  Dream big.  Think huge.  We will have access to glass, steel, lumber and cement.  We will be promoting sustainability and balanced living.  We will be living in love and therefor exploring our passions in our communities.  We will be able to create amazing cities from nothing, with the help of the people who &#8220;do not support us&#8221; and would rather buy homes the old fashioned way from us. And there will be many of those people along the way.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits to the Community</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Secure Free Housing for Our Members</strong></p>\n<p>The perpetual home-building machine is powered by the fact that housing generally sells for about twice of its construction cost. Especially if you have access to lumber, steel and cement resources at lower costs. By selling only the houses needed to break even and keeping the rest, our community is able to continuously build free housing for its members, simply by reinvesting the profits into more construction. </p>\n<p>Please, take the time to consider this proposal as if it were real. Then vote below on whether or not this is a package you would like to see in the future. This vote is just an example, but it will be fun to see what people think!

If I expect nothing of her, as I claim, then why the except at the end?</p>\n<p>Acceptance is difficult because it requires us to come to an understanding.  This understanding is multi-layered, however.  The first layer of Acceptance is realizing that we have control of only one thing in this entire Universe.  Our own actions.  There is literally nothing else we can control.  We can try to manipulate others to do our bidding.  We can become incredibly skilled in this area and lead large groups in one direction or another.  But at the end of the day, when push comes to shove, we can never truly control another person.  There is always an element of risk when manipulating others, for we can never know exactly what the other will say or do.</p>\n<p>The first layer of Acceptance has a tendency to make us feel very small.  We realize that we have no control over any of the outside influences in our life.  This seems so unfair.  No matter how we try to manipulate a situation, no matter what our intention, in the end life plays out as it will and we seem powerless to stop it.</p>\n<p>But Acceptance implies more than just an understanding that we control nothing but our own actions.  The second layer of Acceptance is realizing that although we have no control over anything outside of ourselves, we have absolute control of everything inside of ourselves.  We have control of our thoughts.  But only when we exercise it.  Like any skill, it must be practiced and perfected.  We have control of our emotions.  Through time we begin to see that emotions are simply reactions.  We have control of our level of awareness.  Most importantly, we have control of our actions.</p>\n<p>The third layer of Acceptance is realizing that although we cannot control our surroundings, by exercising control of ourselves we are still able to create true change in our lives.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you want to awaken all of humanity, then awaken all of yourself.

Truly, the greatest gift you have to give is that of your own self-transformation.\u201d &#8211;  Lao Tzu</p>\n<p>When we refuse to accept the conditions life has placed upon us, then we are not living in awareness.  By refusing to accept that I can never see her again, I have continued to contact her every couple of weeks to find out if she has changed her mind.  To see if my words will have changed her.  But in reality, I am only pushing her further away with every message.  Despite my intention, or my words of forgiveness, in my attempt to change her I will only reinforce her fears.  Her fear that I am trying to change her.  Nobody wants to be told what to do, or how to do it.  That is the whole point of the Alternate Economy.  When we try to change others they always resist.  Not sometimes.  Every time.  Always.  Through all of history.  When we try to force ourselves on someone else, they will resist us.  Maybe not at first, but in time, it will always happen.</p>\n<p>When we live in Awareness and truly understand the layers of Acceptance we begin to see that no matter how hard we try, sometimes we loss Love.  If we can accept that the love is gone and will not return, we are able to shift our thought patterns.  We are able to be happy for the good memories shared.  We are able to treasure the fact that we had Love in our life for the time that it lasted.  And we are able to move on to the next opportunity for Love.  Acceptance does not mean forgetting.  Acceptance means true forgiveness.  If I truly forgive my ex-girlfriend, then I will forgive her for never wanting to see me again.  I will Accept this fact and move on with my life.  I will remember the times we shared fondly and I will stop contacting her.  I will stop searching for the right combination of words that will change her.  I will understand that I cannot change her.  I can only change myself.  I can stop feeling remorse for my loss.  I can start feeling joy for my memories.  I can stop feeling regret for my mistakes.  I can start feeling excitement for the new Love I am about to find in my life.  I am Love.  If I can remember that, I can remember that love is good, love is easy, love is beautiful, love is coming, love is given freely, and love is everyone&#8217;s.  Through Acceptance I will come to see that Past Love is not something we should long for.  It is something we should treasure.  How lucky am I to have known her Love?  Now it is time to share that Love with others, so they may know it as well.</p>\n<p>I am Love.  I will Accept that I can never see my ex again.  I will move forward in Love and continue to push my message that love is good, love is easy, love is beautiful, love is coming, love is given freely and love is everyone&#8217;s.  I will give my ex the space she needs.  I will instead extend my love to everyone as love is given freely.  I will move forward in Love, Accepting that by changing myself, I will create the Love I seek.</p>\n", "post_id": 718, "location": false, "date": "02-08-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["emotion", "love", "cancer", "give", "age of aquarius", "universal", "idea", "currency", "gemini", "moral", "thanks", "selfishness", "alternative", "education", "employment", "fear", "happiness", "astrology", "gratitude", "selfish", "inheritance", "justice", "hate", "discussion", "alternate", "reality", "religion", "remorse", "economy", "greatness", "passion", "hope", "2012", "unemployment", "absolute truth", "compassion", "joy", "aquarius", "judgement", "protection", "imagine", "law", "security", "morality", "loss", "forum", "receive", "science", "foolishness", "conversation", "truth", "universe", "hatred", "balance", "greed", "generosity"], "text": "<p>We feel very strongly that we need to possess certain things in order to be happy.  But this idea, that our possessions make us happy relies on one assumption: we are able to possess things.</p>\n<p>What, exactly, are we able to possess?</p>\n<p>Love is the one thing that we all feel that we need to possess, yet how can Love be possessed?  Possession assumes ownership.  Yesterday I related a story about my ex-girlfriend.  I did not go into much detail except to say that I have been asked by her to forget, and to never contact her again.  I am having a difficult time accepting this reality, because I do not feel I did anything to deserve this treatment.  But what is really bothering me?  I want to have certain things from my ex-girlfriend.  I say I forgive her, yet I want her to say she forgives me.  I want to possess her forgiveness.  I want her to smile again.  I want her to accept me.  I want her love.  But I cannot possess any of these things.  Even if I was receiving her forgiveness and her acceptance and her Love, what really would have changed about me?</p>\n<p>Why do I feel the need to possess her forgiveness, to possess her acceptance, to possess her Love?  It is because a part of me feels empty.  It is because I feel that I have made a mistake, although I am not sure what that mistake is.  It is because I feel that her rejection of me has somehow lessened me.</p>\n<p>But what is really happening here?  I have created a need inside of myself and told myself that if I possess one thing, that need will be filled and I will become whole again.  But how was that need created?  I did not always love my ex-girlfriend.  In fact, I only met her about a year and a half ago.  So why do I need her approval to be whole?</p>\n<p>The Truth is that I do not need her approval.  I do not need her forgiveness.  I do not need her Love.  Love is not something we possess.  How can you own someone&#8217;s love?  How can you control it?  Hold on to it?  It can&#8217;t be done.  Love is not a thing that needs to be possessed.  Love is created.  Love pours forth from us when we are actively engaged in another&#8217;s growth.  Love comes from a connection to the Truth and blossoms when both parties tend to its fruit.</p>\n<p>I cannot possess my ex&#8217;s Love.  I did not possess it before.  That does not mean we did not share Love many times.  But that is the thing.  Love is not owned.  It is shared.  When we try to own it, we stiffle the ability to create it.  In our attempts to possess Love, we always lose it.  Not because our intentions are impure.  But because we are working in opposite directions to Love.  Love is shared and created, never owned or guarded.  When we ask for Love, we will be turned down, every time.  Not even because our lover necessarily wishes to deny us.  It is because we are asking the impossible.  We ask for them to create something and give it to us.  Love does not work that way.  Love must be actively engaged in by both parties.  We cannot ask for love to be given to us.  We must actively create Love at all times, with everyone we meet.  Only then, with enough practice, will we begin to see the Love returned.  Not because we have asked for it.  But because we are Love.  Eventually, we will meet the right people who will recognize the Love within us, and we will be satisfied.</p>\n<p>But being Love and living in awareness implies patience and repeated failures as we perfect ourselves.  We cannot give in to wants and possessions.  We will never have the things we want to possess anyways.  Not because we should not have them or do not deserve them.  But because we ask the impossible.  We ask to own something that cannot be owned!</p>\n<p>At the Alternate Economy I have been trying to push one idea.  This idea is that if we can change ourselves and live in Love, we can become Love.  We can remember that love is good, love is easy, love is beautiful, love is COMING, love is given freely and love is everyone&#8217;s.  At the Alternate Economy, we begin to realize that we truly possess nothing.  Nor do we need to possess anything.  What is it, that we truly need?</p>\n<p>We need Love.  We need personal space.  We need to pursue our passions.  We need to feel secure in our access to resources.</p>\n<p>What else do we need?  </p>\n<p>At the Alternate Economy we will begin to see that when we live in Love, money can be used to create whatever we need.  And what do we need?  We need equality and freedom and an easier access to Love.  We do not need possessions.  We need Hope.  We need a future.  We need to look inside of ourselves and make the transformation to Love.  We need to stand tall together.  We need to do this.  Today.</p>\n<p>Today I will accept that I cannot possess another&#8217;s Love.  I can only create it with everyone I meet from this point forward.  Today I am Love.</p>\n", "post_id": 733, "location": false, "date": "02-09-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["emotion", "love", "cancer", "give", "age of aquarius", "universal", "idea", "currency", "gemini", "moral", "thanks", "selfishness", "alternative", "education", "employment", "fear", "happiness", "astrology", "gratitude", "selfish", "inheritance", "justice", "hate", "discussion", "alternate", "reality", "religion", "remorse", "economy", "greatness", "passion", "hope", "2012", "unemployment", "absolute truth", "compassion", "joy", "aquarius", "judgement", "protection", "imagine", "law", "security", "morality", "loss", "forum", "receive", "science", "foolishness", "conversation", "truth", "universe", "hatred", "balance", "greed", "generosity"], "text": "<p>Humanity supposes they are alone in their quest for identity.

He has 86 acres of farmland, much of which is in use, but much of which stands fallow as well.  Assuming that we maintain the land and the crops and provide the seed, we are free to use the land as we wish.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.mariposa-duck.on.ca/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\"></p>\n<p>What a spectacular offer!  I am still trying to figure out how this benefits Ian, but sometimes Generosity is simply that.  His land is unused.  We need land.</p>\n<p>To start, since I have little experience as a farmer, I would like to ask Ian for a small 1/4 to 1/2 acre plot.</p>\n<p>Here is how I see this working.  I would like to grow some simple crops throughout the summer, organically, and split the harvest in three ways.  One half of the harvest will go to market, to raise funds for the Alternate Economy, so that we may purchase land of our own.  One quarter of the harvest will go to Ian, for his generosity in using his land.  One quarter will be donated to the local Salvation Army soup kitchen.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.usawaterquality.org/themes/npm/images/crops_organic.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>But now it is time to brainstorm!</p>\n<p>I do not mind providing the labour for the summer to work this farm.  I would like to chronicle its successes on this blog in order to garner more support for our cause.  I have a job, in the evenings, which I can continue to work while tending to the gardens in the daytime.  By keeping the garden small and recruiting my friends (I already have one colleague who is an avid gardener and has invited me over on wednesday lunch to discuss how she can participate) it should be manageable.  I am not interested in garnishing my salary.  I make enough money currently.  I am more than happy to donate all of the proceeds from this endeavour back to the Alternate Economy.  After a summer&#8217;s growth, we may just have enough to purchase an acre of our own.  </p>\n<p>So, now I call to you, my blog followers.  One of the main reasons for doing this project would be to form a concrete example of how Generosity can and will solve the problems we are facing.  There are currently 750 followers to this blog. I alone will have a hard time coming up with the funds to seed this plot of land.  I might be able to come up with the money for seeds, but that is about it.  Together, we could potentially build a small portable greenhouse, or two, or three.  We could buy a female pig, to add to Ian&#8217;s stock.  We could buy some chickens and sell the eggs.  We could buy a beehive.  Together, our options begin to multiply.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/permaculture-hawaii.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/pyramid-greenhouse.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\"></p>\n<p>So, please, come to me with your ideas!  What would you do, if you had a half acre plot to work with?  How much would you be willing to give to see this project become a reality?  If everyone gave $10, we would very definitely be able to make some interesting headway on this project.</p>\n<p>I am willing to donate my labour and the money it will take to fill up my car with gas to get to the farm every second day.  I am willing to put some money towards seeds.  To chronicle the successes and failures of the endeavour.  I am willing to donate all of the proceeds back to the Alternate Economy.  Ian is willing to lend us his farm, free of charge, because he believes in our goals and our mission.  What are you willing to do?</p>\n<p>For those of you who are not willing to participate, please leave comments indicating why.</p>\n<a name=\"pd_a_5853624\"></a>\n<div class=\"PDS_Poll\" id=\"PDI_container5853624\" style=\"display:inline-block;\"></div>\n<div id=\"PD_superContainer\"></div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" charset=\"UTF-8\" src=\"//static.polldaddy.com/p/5853624.js\"></script>\n<noscript><a href=\"http://polldaddy.com/poll/5853624\">Take Our Poll</a></noscript>\n", "post_id": 750, "location": false, "date": "02-12-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["emotion", "love", "cancer", "give", "age of aquarius", "universal", "idea", "currency", "gemini", "moral", "thanks", "selfishness", "alternative", "education", "employment", "fear", "happiness", "astrology", "gratitude", "selfish", "inheritance", "justice", "hate", "discussion", "alternate", "reality", "religion", "remorse", "economy", "greatness", "passion", "hope", "2012", "unemployment", "absolute truth", "compassion", "joy", "aquarius", "judgement", "protection", "imagine", "law", "security", "morality", "loss", "forum", "receive", "science", "foolishness", "conversation", "truth", "universe", "hatred", "balance", "greed", "generosity"], "text": "<p>In our world today, it is actions that define the person, not words.  A lofty statement coming from someone such as myself.  This blog features many, many, many words.</p>\n<p>I keep asking you to trust in me.  I would ask that you simply trust in yourself, but it seems somehow easier to get you to trust in me.  If you could trust in yourself to live in Love, to greet every instance in your life with the knowledge that love is good, love is easy, love is beautiful, love is coming, love is given freely and love is everyone&#8217;s then you would hardly need to trust in me.</p>\n<p>But I feel very strongly that if I can do this, if I can live in Love, then anyone can do it.  Perhaps if I could get you to see that one person is trustworthy, you would begin to trust in yourselves.</p>\n<p>So who am I?  Why do I deserve your trust?  Am I even capable of the things I say?</p>\n<p>It is the actions that define the person.  My words are beautiful, but they are wind.  In order for you to ever trust me, you must first come to see me for who I truly am.</p>\n<p>I believe in Love.  I believe in the success of the Alternate Economy.  I do not pressume to be so incredibly wise as to know how this thing will play out.  Maybe we will form a bank, maybe we won&#8217;t.  I still think it is a good idea, but many don&#8217;t and I am willing to listen&#8230; to alternate solutions.  Constructive criticisms and alternate ideas will always be welcome.  I feel very strongly that there is a reason that my blog has received the success it has.  I have 800 followers in only 2 months.  I have nearly as many comments and dozens of reblogs of my postings.  Love is the answer.  People want this to be true.</p>\n<p>So now it is time to prove to you who I am.  Not with my words, but with my actions.  This blog will soon become a chronicle of my upcoming venture with Mariposa Farms.  Another point in Love&#8217;s favour, I have been offered a plot of farmland to use to raise crops for the Alternate Economy, free of charge.  What generosity?  The crazy thing is, I did not even ask&#8230;  I was simply approached by a relative stranger, our only connection a recent friend.  </p>\n<p>I am ready to live in Love and follow the path the Universe sets before me.  I was not expecting to spend my summer farming two weeks ago, and now I could not be more excited.  Through my labour and my Love, I know my crops will succeed to some measure.  I believe that the Universe wants this idea to succeed.  Why would it not want to see Balance restored.  I will take this amazing opportunity and use it to prove to you, my newest friends, that I am who I say I am.  I will use the land to grow crops organically.  I may not be able to get organic certification, but I will not use pesticides either way.  Organic is a way of life, not a certificate.  I will use the compost from the farm animals to get the soil ready.  I will start the plants indoors, to make sure they are nice and healthy when they are finally exposed to the elements.  I will listen to the advice of the people around me.  I will spend every day at the farm, even though I have a full time job.  I will enjoy every minute of it.  I will give everything I harvest back to you, my friends, who helped me get so far.  I will recruit my friend Linette to can pickles and hotsauces and pasta sauces and chutnies.  She can&#8217;t wait to be involved.  I will create bi-weekly packages for sale to help raise funds to put into a joint account for the Alternate Economy.  I will send parcels to the local soup kitchen to help feed the homeless in my community.  I will give some of the crops back to Ian for his amazing generosity in using his lands.  I will keep some food for myself, to help improve my health.  And at the end of the summer we will share in the successes of this farm.  The money raised will go towards buying a piece of farmland of our own.  Or perhaps it will go to some other investment.  The point is, I will include you in every step.  If you choose to help out, I will accept your help lovingly.  If you choose to simply offer your support I will accept that too!  I will accept donations during the early stages, because I am not made of money and I do not know if I can afford to plant an entire 1/4 acre of land.  But know that I will account for every penny donated and where it is spent.  There will be no secrets here.  If you want to send actual seeds or tools rather than money, that would be great too.  If you want to wait a year and see how this pans out, I do not blame you.  I am not really offering you anything.  I will be blunt.  I am offering you a story of Love and success and an ability to participate in its start-up.  That is about it.  If you do not live in the area, then I can&#8217;t really offer you any vegetables.  I could mail you a can of preserves&#8230;</p>\n<p>The reason I feel this farm is so important is because it allows me to show you who I am.  You will see my successes and my failures.  See where I wasted money and where I spent it wisely.  You will see that I am human, I make mistakes, but in the end I am still capable of greatness.  We all are.  I know I am.  But I do not feel like my actions indicate that I have become great.  Not yet.  My words are nice, but my actions are few and far between.  The time has come.  The moment is now.  If I am ever to be great it starts today.</p>\n<p>Today I will move forward in Love.  I will continue to write about my successes, but my focus will be on my actions, rather than always my philosophy.  It is time to trust in one another.  I know you can trust in me.  Now it is time to prove it.  I will be asking for donations, but I will be farming with or without them.  I will only plan projects I can afford and if I get some help I will ask you how you think it should be spent.  I will spend my summer in the sun, sharing my Love with my crops, with my community and here on my blog, with you.</p>\n<p>Please join me at least in witnessing my transformation.  I am Love.

time I saw this picture on facebook: I was blown away. What an expression of liberating oneself from\u2026., from what exactly? From some kind of casting mould it seems. The statue depicts a person who expresses a deeply felt connection with his higher purpose, He celebrates being an integral and indispensible part of the universe, ready to fully and unconditionally participate in the perpetual\u00a0process of co-creation. Allowing himself to wonder, to enjoy life, to laugh, to love\u00a0and to be free. Free and yet connected to everything else in the universe. An individual yet part of the collective wisdom and intuition of the universe. Free of the shackles of forced uniformity dictated by an obsolete worldview, free\u00a0from being told what to do by everyone and all. Free from living a life which is not his. Free to accept responsibility for himself and the context in which he\u2026</p>\n</div><p class=\"reblog-source\"><a href=\"http://geerthofman.wordpress.com/2012/02/24/breaking-free/\">View original</a> <span class=\"more-words\">207 more words</span></p></div></div>", "post_id": 860, "location": false, "date": "02-24-2012", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["emotion", "love", "cancer", "give", "age of aquarius", "universal", "testing", "idea", "currency", "gemini", "thanks", "selfishness", "alternative", "education", "hate", "fear", "happiness", "astrology", "gratitude", "selfish", "inheritance", "employment", "discussion", "alternate", "religion", "remorse", "economy", "greatness", "passion", "hope", "2012", "unemployment", "absolute truth", "compassion", "joy", "aquarius", "judgement", "protection", "imagine", "security", "loss", "forum", "receive", "science", "foolishness", "conversation", "truth", "universe", "hatred", "balance", "greed", "generosity"], "text": "<p><a href='http://www.alternate-economy.com/videos/BalancedEmotions.mp4'>Click here for video: Balanced Emotions</a></p>\n<p>I am so very pleased to announce the newest video for the Alternate Economy.

It makes no sense. It is based on nothing, as far as I can tell.</p>\n<p>I would like to propose a new Calendar for a new Age of Aquarius.</p>\n<p>There are 365 days in a year. 7 days in a week. Why are there 12 months of different sizes? 13 x 28 = 364. There should be 13 months of 28 days each, with a new year&#8217;s day that does not belong to any month or week, attached at the beginning. 365 days. Throw a leap day in every 4 years, and there we have it. A calendar where the first of every month is always a Monday. There are four weeks exactly in every month. There is one day which is celebrated on its own, New Year&#8217;s Day.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t really like having New Year&#8217;s day in the dead of winter. That also makes little sense. I would propose that the Spring equinox should in fact be the first day of the year.</p>\n<p>Also, I do not like the names of the days or months. I have a few suggestions for better names. These are obviously only silly examples, but I kind of like them.</p>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"50\" height=\"30\">Preparid<br />\nMonday</td>\n<td width=\"50\" height=\"30\">Workid<br />\nTuesday</td>\n<td width=\"50\" height=\"30\">Valid<br />\nWednesday</td>\n<td width=\"50\" height=\"30\">Perfectid<br />\nThursday</td>\n<td width=\"50\" height=\"30\">Satisfid<br />\nFriday</td>\n<td width=\"50\" height=\"30\">Restid<br />\nSaturday</td>\n<td width=\"50\" height=\"30\">Inspirid<br />\nSunday</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Monday is the day of planning &#8211;

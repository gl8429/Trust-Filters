I was always involved in numerous other activities in and out of school as well as community projects. I was passionate about entering the medical profession and despite being told on many occasions that it would be difficult because I was female, I was involved in too many extracurricular activities, I didn&#8217;t come from a medical family and it was a long hard course I was arrogantly determined to succeed. On one occasion my headmistress took me aside to persuade me to apply for another profession such as social work or biochemistry but I was insistent and persistently urged her to make sure my application form went off promptly by daily enquiring at the school office.<br />\nI did get a place at medical school first time, one of 11 women in the year and thoroughly enjoyed being a student and I have appreciated not only the privilege of serving and caring for patients but also the challenge of working to solve the diverse biopsychosocial problems which seem to get more complex as the years pass. Originally my gaze was solely on the patient and their needs but my concern is that we are being coerced into working within a computerised and performance managed healthcare and it is getting increasingly difficult to maintain that patient-centred gaze. The consultation flow and purpose tends to be dictated by what appears on the computer rather than allowing the patient to present their personal concerns.<br />\nI have to say I had no objection to the introduction of computers as it made it much easier to produce prescriptions with fewer errors and a more organised way of keeping track of patients with chronic illnesses aswell as adhering to evidence based guidelines. For example, after very few clicks taking seconds it is possible to find out how many diabetics there are and whether they are up to date with their monitoring which in turn can prevent serious complications and therefore means we can focus on those patients that need more in depth care and need to be encouraged to attend for guidance.<br />\nHowever, if each patient is not seen as individual and they are not consulted holistically and facilitated to work with the healthcare professional the outcome will be no different. The buzz word is &#8216;motivational counselling&#8217; which involves encouraging the patient to find a way and to see the benefit of changing their behaviour to improve their health. I have heard this brought up on numerous occasions when we have been discussing the complex medical problems associated with a patient. Time and time again the major conclusion to improving diabetic control or reducing hospital admission has been the suggestion to carry out &#8216;motivational counselling&#8217; to encourage increased exercise, reduce weight or stop smoking or take their medication regularly.<br />\nBut it can mean that when we see that patient we can be so concerned about their monitoring, their weight , blood pressure, blood tests etc which is what the computer reminds us to do that we overlook to ask about how they are feeling and why they want to see a doctor.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/image6.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1085\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/image6.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a><br />\nDavid Loxterkamp in his BMJ Essay this week described similar concerns. Loxtercamp was an early adopter of the electronic health record and thirteen years ago wrote with enthusiasm about it&#8217;s use now he says\u201d With the practice computer we have created a monster that now directs the patient encounter, and which itself needs care and feeding.<br />\nDoctors are experts at knowing what to know in order to pass the test, he says. And if they are rewarded for collecting data rather than talking to patients, that\u2019s what doctors will do. Space for talking, or more importantly listening, to patients is squeezed out by the pressure to complete chronic disease flow charts and checklists of overdue prevention measures.<br />\nPerhaps this would matter less if there were a real sense that such activities improve health. But we know that routine health checks don\u2019t reduce mortality or morbidity. And Loxterkamp lists many other interventions that have been foisted on an unsuspecting public in the name of preventive health but subsequently have been found to be useless or even harmful.&#8221;<br />\nI think it would be impossible at this stage, which I am sure even Luddites and sentimentalists would understand as being able to measures outcomes and fosters research gives us a way affording some sort of reality check as to what we are providing as a health service for our patients. Indeed, it has been by the use of data that the recent catalogue of disasters in our hospitals have been exposed and no doubt there are more to come when they begin to analyse and inspect General Practise more closely and how some drugs have resulted in serious side effects or shown to have life-prolonging effects<br />\nMeanwhile, I felt all was not lost when I heard that the CQC inspectors will be more interested in patient and staff satisfaction by interview rather than simply looking at computer generated achievements.<br />\nThe importance of the medical consultation is often by the placebo effect. Turner and Brody have shown that placebos consistently deliver \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cexcellent\u201d results in 64-75% of recipients, especially where subjectivity is involved (such as with pain or depression). The benefits are magnified by the doctor who actively listens, shows empathy and concern, provides satisfactory explanations, and creates a treatment plan with the patient at the controls.<br />\nA common sentence I have heard over the years&#8221; I feel much better after speaking to you doctor.&#8221; confirms this.</p>\n<p>I was reassured this summer when we had two work experience students who were keen to study Medicine and were motivated in the same way I had been more than 40 years ago with the same desire to make a difference in people&#8217;s lives and the fascination for workings of the human body. They were just as determined and involved themselves in initiatives with community projects. Despite being discouraged by others around them they were both arrogantly determined and had that naivety which somehow helps you maintain the determination.<br />\nDuring the past few years I have been teaching medical students who have decided to change career because they feel they want to serve people more closely with an interest in healing. They have changed from a wide variety of walks of life; a chef, an Oxford Don, biochemist, business managers,lawyer and teacher to name a few. They feel they want to deal with people rather than data or profits: I hope they won&#8217;t feel disappointed.<br />\nI also particularly recall the final year medical who was keen to become a neurosurgeon at the start of his placement. He was a handsome young man skilled and charming, could have been the star of any medical &#8216;soap&#8217;! One day towards the end of the placement he came to talk with me to review a patient he had seen and seemed worried. When I enquired he told me that the ver ill patient we had seen the previous week had particularly asked to see him as she didn&#8217;t want to waste a doctor&#8217;s time. She had been diagnosed with terminal cancer and as there was nothing any doctor could do for her but she wanted to talk to someone she had thought he might help. As he listened to her tears had rolled uncontrollably down his face and his reaction had been to hold her hand to reassure her. He was worried he had been unprofessional on two accounts crying and holding her hand and was wanting my advise as to how to act in this sort of situation.<br />\nI told him he had discovered empathy and should be pleased he had discovered it so e\u00e1rly in his career. Later he went on to tell me that perhaps he would be seriously thinking of becoming a General Practitioner instead of a Neurosurgeon.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/image7.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1087\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/image7.jpg?w=300&#038;h=199\" width=\"300\" height=\"199\" /></a><br />\nThere will always be doctors who will see the patients who are aloof from the World Wide Web and the type of doctor who will consider a patient&#8217;s individual medical and social needs.<br />\nHowever,we also need those doctors especially the younger more digitally aware who will collect and harvest data using this vital new tool to provide guidelines for care and deliver it where appropriate and deal with e-patients who need not be mere recipients of care but can become key decision-makers in their own treatment process.<br />\nI recall when I was assisting in the paediatric leukaemia clinic and remember children barely five years of age who entered the rooms reciting relevant symptoms, the size of their spleen, discussing their latest blood counts and appropriate management in a dispassionate way. They were like virtual e-patients collecting information and being part of their own management. That worked very well until things didn&#8217;t go to plan and then the same doctor had to discuss plans foe end of life and talk with the extended family. This demanded an empathetic doctor skilled at listening, showing concern and finding ways of empowering the patient and family to cope following a new direction.<br />\nI do think the doctors clinical gaze has changed but hopefully this combination of doctors and simply an awareness a new type of gaze that doctors can continue to perceive that<br />\n&#8220;patients are not only data fields for the doctor to harvest, objects to be imaged, or problems to be solved. They are also our neighbours asking for help.\u201d</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/image8.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1089\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/image8.jpg?w=276&#038;h=183\" width=\"276\" height=\"183\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 1004, "location": false, "date": "10-06-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["lifestyle", "Mencap", "Ealing", "Ecil", "Half marathon", "Epilepsy action", "health benefits", "Samaritans"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/image26.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1011\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/image26.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=258\"   /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Come and cheer on the ECIL All Stars, who are running to raise funds for disabled people and carers in Ealing.

We manage an art collection of more than 1,600 pieces that are displayed across all five Trust sites. <strong>A healthier community</strong> \u2013 supporting projects that tackle health inequalities in the communities served by the Trust There are huge disparities in the health of the communities where the Trust\u2019s hospitals are based. By funding local community organisations and initiatives, the Charity is able to support the Trust, in accessing some of the hardest to reach communities, where health problems prevail. ************************ <a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/image55.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1058\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/image55.jpg?w=150&#038;h=144\" width=\"150\" height=\"144\" /></a> In 2010 22 year-old Holly Bantleman set off on a soul-searching round-the-world trip, hoping to have that &#8216;life changing&#8217; experience and during this trip she visited Kenya. Raise the Roof Kenya&#8217; began after she visited a village on a dump site called &#8216;London&#8217; in the town of Nakuru. The area had sprung up after the 2007/2009 electoral violence in which so many people were displaced. Over 250 people, many children, set up camp on the landfill and found themselves with no means of escape, relying on the rubbish truck for their food, with children playing in rags, barefoot and literally starving. Initially the the idea was to raise the money to buy tin roofing for the people living on the landfill without food or shelter and to eventually provide a long term solution for their plight. With that mission accomplished after raising money through UK donations, several more visits to Kenya, and many more eye opening experiences, Holly decided that RTRK would become a long term project. From school fees and medical bills, to housing and small businesses, RTRK have managed to support children and families in destitute situations. Now spending a third of her year in Kenya, Holly has noticed a lack of opportunity for the bigger teenage kids, (she was one herself not so long ago!) so has found another directions in which to take RTRK &#8211; the &#8216;Think Big&#8217; Project is the Barut Development Centre build. The idea is for us to provide the community (the poorest in the area) with a sports ground, community centre and vocational school so people can gain education and training to go on and live sustainably in the future. ************************** <a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/image56.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1059\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/image56.jpg?w=150&#038;h=58\" width=\"150\" height=\"58\" /></a> St Mungo&#8217;s opens doors for homeless people.

The Gabrielle Gray Foundation was inspired by the compassion that Gaby showed towards others throughout the 31 years of her life. Some of her last advice to us was to not be bitter, to be grateful for everything and no matter how bad things seem they can always be worse. These wise words remind us of how fortunate most of us are. The Gabrielle Gray Foundation will be helping young vulnerable adults between the ages of 18-24 in West London. Help us to help others who are less fortunate and continue her legacy. <strong>If anyone reading this may have benefitted from one of these charities or who ran the half marathon for another worthy cause it would be great to publish your story on this site, which aims to talk about health and related issues especially of local interest.</strong></p>\n", "post_id": 1044, "location": false, "date": "09-30-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Smoking cessation", "Health", "health benefits"], "text": "<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/image2.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1069 aligncenter\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/image2.jpg?w=221&#038;h=228\" width=\"221\" height=\"228\" /></a> <a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/image4.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1074\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/image4.jpg?w=226&#038;h=126\" width=\"226\" height=\"126\" /></a><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1067\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/image.jpg?w=150&#038;h=72\" width=\"150\" height=\"72\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Stoptober, it\u2019s like October but without the cigarettes.</strong><br />\nGet your free Stoptober pack using the link below<br />\nIt contains your free support tools to help you get through<br />\nthe 28 days. <strong><a href=\"https://stoptober.smokefree.nhs.uk\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://stoptober.smokefree.nhs.uk</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Ways in which you get support</strong><br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/image1.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1068\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/image1.jpg?w=256&#038;h=197\" width=\"256\" height=\"197\" /></a><br />\nMOBILE APP<br />\nOur helpful, interactive Stoptober app is available on iPhone and Android smartphones.</p>\n<p>TEXT SUPPORT<br />\nRegular texts that will keep you focused, wherever you are.</p>\n<p>EMAIL SUPPORT<br />\nDaily emails packed full of useful tips and advice.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/image3.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-1071\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/image3.jpg?w=150&#038;h=73\" width=\"150\" height=\"73\" /></a><strong>Find Local NHS Stop Smoking Services</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://smokefree.nhs.uk/ways-to-quit/local-nhs-stop-smoking-service/results/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://smokefree.nhs.uk/ways-to-quit/local-nhs-stop-smoking-service/results/</a></p>\n<p><strong>EALING</strong><br />\n<strong>Languages: Contact in English</strong><br />\n<strong>Helpline opening times: Mon &#8211; Fri 9am &#8211; 5pm</strong><br />\n<strong>Referral method: Self referral to helpline on 0800 8766683.

It is thought to be important for lowering health risks, such as obesity, heart disease, diabetes, hypertension and cancer. A healthy diet involves consuming primarily fruits, vegetables, and whole grains to satisfy caloric requirements, provide the body with essential nutrients, phytochemicals, and fibre, and provide adequate water intake. A healthy diet supports energy needs and provides for human nutrition without exposure to toxicity or excessive weight gain from consuming excessive amounts.<br />\nI think it is a good idea that we all stop and think about what we are eating.

I know if there are only biscuits in the surgery then that is what I eat but if I organise myself I can snack and can eat very healthily with not much effort.\u00a0Reading the news today I was saddened to read of children&#8217;s food ignorance. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-Cheese\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-Cheese</a> comes from plants and fish fingers are made of chicken, according to a significant number of children questioned on their knowledge of where food comes from.<br />\nThe British Nutrition Foundation (BNF) included more than 27,500 children in the research and found that nearly a third (29%) of primary school children think that cheese comes from plants, and nearly one in five (18%) primary school children said that fish fingers comes from chicken.The survey also found that one in 10 secondary school children believe that tomatoes grow under the ground. The largest of its kind, the study was conducted as part of the BNF&#8217;s Healthy Eating Week, which is launched on Monday by The Princess Royal.More than 3,000 schools are participating in the week-long event, during which more than 1.2 million children will learn about healthy eating, cooking and where food come from. Roy Ballam, education programme manager at the BNF, said the high numbers of schools taking part shows there is an understanding of how important it is to encourage healthy eating. And so it goes on&#8230;&#8230;.Most of us are aware what we should be eating and most supermarket produce relevant literature and children in school are taught formally about healthy food but despite that they remain ignorant.\u00a0To find out more about healthy eating \u00a0refer to the section in nhs choices <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/healthy-eating/Pages/Healthyeating.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/healthy-eating/Pages/Healthyeating.aspx</a>.<br />\nMeals should be a social time to sit together to discuss the day, share each others concerns and as well as enjoy each others company.

This may be because the woman is too young to have been screened. Or it may be because she is no longer getting invitations from the screening programme because she is over 70. Or it could be that a breast cancer starts to cause symptoms between mammograms (known as an interval cancer).</p>\n<p><strong>What to look for</strong><br />\nBeing breast aware simply means getting to know how your breasts normally look and feel at different times of the month. If you notice a change that isn&#8217;t normal for you, talk it over with your doctor and ask for a referral to the breast clinic.</p>\n<p>You don&#8217;t need to examine your breasts every day or even every week. But it is important to know how your breasts normally feel, and how that changes with your periods. Some women have lumpier breasts around the time of a period. If this is the same in both breasts, don&#8217;t worry. But check your breasts again the following month, a few days after your period is over. If the lumpiness comes and goes with your menstrual cycle, it is nothing to worry about.</p>\n<p>It is easiest to check your breasts in the shower or bath. Run a soapy hand over each breast and up under your arm.</p>\n<p><strong>The NHS breast awareness five point code says</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Know what is normal for you</li>\n<li>Look and feel</li>\n<li>Know what changes to look for</li>\n<li>Report any changes without delay</li>\n<li>Attend for breast screening if you are aged 50 or over\n<p>You are checking for changes in the size, shape or feel of your breast. This could mean a lump or thickening anywhere in the breast. Most people naturally have one breast bigger than the other. It is a change in size or shape that you need to watch out for.</p>\n<p><strong>Symptoms of breast cancer</strong><br />\n<strong>What to look out for</strong><br />\nChanges that could be due to a breast cancer are</li>\n<li>A lump or thickening in an area of the breast</li>\n<li>A change in the size or shape of a breast</li>\n<li>Dimpling of the skin</li>\n<li>A change in the shape of your nipple, particularly if it turns in, sinks into the breast, or has an irregular shape</li>\n<li>A blood stained discharge from the nipple</li>\n<li>A rash on a nipple or surrounding area</li>\n<li>A swelling or lump in your armpit</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p>Like breast lumps, these signs don&#8217;t necessarily mean cancer. Inverted nipples, blood stained nipple discharge or a rash can all be due to other medical conditions. But if any of these things happen to you, you need to get it checked out. It is most likely to be a benign condition that can easily be treated and seeing the GP will put your mind at rest. But if it does turn out to be a cancer you give yourself the best chance of successful treatment by going to the doctor early on.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image114.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-517\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image114.jpg?w=150&#038;h=58\" width=\"150\" height=\"58\" /></a></p>\n<p>If you want to know more about breast cancer, including symptoms, risk factors, causes, and preventing breast cancer.

Nevertheless, having been busy all their lives they can&#8217;t resist getting involved in organising concerts, ambitious needlework/patchwork projects,making jams and preserves,organising barbecues, painting, sculpture, \u00a0and \u00a0house renovation \u00a0not forgetting \u00a0writing, fishing, keeping chickens and horses, exploring the surrounding countryside on foot or bicycle and landscaping the land they own.<br />\nWhen friends in the UK say &#8220;but what do you find to do all day ?&#8221; It is difficult to know where to start. Peter had lived in London and had done various projects in the UK but was finding the incessant aeroplane traffic noise, worked in the City but retired and living under the major flight path was becoming increasingly tedious. He was no longer enjoying the buzz of London and decided to retire to France to build a house. He was initially unsure whether he would ever see the results of his dreams as his blood pressure and cholesterol had been very high despite medication and \u00a0he knew he was at a high risk of having a cardiovascular event, either a heart attack or stroke. He was overweight and his diet was poor, the only saving grace was that he had given up smoking many years ago.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/image14.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1308\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/image14.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a><br />\nAfter 6 months of living outside a quiet village in the Dronne valley in the Dordogne, known as the land of Primitive Man, the house that had been a dream was beginning to materialise but even better news was that his blood pressure was now within normal limits to the point that he stopped all medication, his cholesterol had fallen from 11mmol/l to &lt; 4mmol/l and he only needed to be on very low dose statin.

All this is important as they embark and support each other on another project. Interestingly one of the men described how he had had lunch with apache men on a girder in New York &#8211; amazing &#8230;&#8230;.</p>\n<p>However, on this occasion the subject turned to medical issues and Peter brought up the fact that he had acquired a hernia whilst lopping some branches off a tree which was obscuring a good view down the river when he was sitting on his newly constructed jetty. It wasn&#8217;t long before the men in turn laid claim to the fact that they all had a hernia of some sort of other and proceeded to share how and where they had had it repaired recalling their symptoms concerns and described their experiences in graphic terms. That is the trouble if you are a doctor people don&#8217;t hold back in giving their detailed descriptions of their medical conditions as they somehow feel you need to have the full description.<br />\nBernard who had bilateral hernias but was in his late 80&#8242;s had been treated for leukaemia and various cancers in the past and is always entertaining as he graphically describes his near death experiences in various corners of the world ranging from being before a firing squad, a noose around his neck or being dumped in the back of beyond and having to find a way out all graphically recalled. He was embarking on building a Chinese bridge over a small lake he had created, was fighting for supremacy with his large Sussex cockerel who had dared to attempt to assault his hen (his wife)and was still playing a round of golf twice most weeks thought he would avoid surgery and had persuaded his French GP to prescribe him a truss! I haven&#8217;t prescribed one of those for years since I looked after ex-miners who had such bad chest conditions that they were unable to be even considered for surgery.<br />\nRoger,who had had open heart surgery previously had been enthusiastically trying to make a perfect lawn of his one and a half acre garden and had acquired his hernia, was wary of French medicine was opting to return to the UK to attend the London Hernia Clinic. The others present had had theirs repaired in various hospitals throughout the World and were recalling their experiences.</p>\n<p><strong>What is a hernia?</strong><br />\nA hernia (or &#8216;rupture&#8217;) occurs where there is a weakness in the wall of the tummy (abdomen). As a result, some of the contents within the abdomen can then push through (bulge) under the skin. Normally, the front of the abdomen has several layers comprising skin, then fat, then muscles, which all keep the guts (intestines) and internal tissues in place. If, for any reason, there is a weak point in the muscles, then part of the intestines can push through. You can then feel a soft lump or swelling under the skin.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/image5.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1293\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/image5.jpg?w=272&#038;h=185\" width=\"272\" height=\"185\" /></a></p>\n<p>What are the types of hernia?<br />\nDifferent types of hernia can occur. The most common types are listed here:</p>\n<p><strong>Support groups</strong><br />\nThe British Hernia Centre<br />\n87 Watford Way Hendon Central London NW4 4RS Tel:&#8230;<br />\nInguinal hernia<br />\nThis is the most common type of hernia. Males are more likely to have inguinal hernias, as they have a small tunnel in the tissues of their groins which occurred when they were developing as a baby. This tunnel allowed the testicles (testes) to come down from the tummy (abdomen) into the scrotum. Tissue from the intestines can also pass into this tunnel, forming an inguinal hernia.</p>\n<p>There are two main types: indirect hernias, which are usually congenital and common in boys, and direct hernias, which are more common in adult men. They can occur in both sides of the body.<br />\nWith the wealth of advise Peter had been given he decided to phone his French GP next morning.&#8221; Could you come down this afternoon about 3pm&#8221;, the receptionist said. &#8220;That&#8217;s fine,&#8221; said Peter but then muttered that he would probably have to wait about 40minutes as he spends so much time with each patient.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/image31.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-1349\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/image31.jpg?w=259&#038;h=194\" width=\"259\" height=\"194\" /></a></p>\n<p>Having then decided to have the hernia attended to in France and Peter proceeded with the necessary arrangements.<br />\nInfact, the GP is a Greek doctor married to an English doctor who had been working in Coventry and they had come to France in 2005 as they had been disillusioned with General Practise in the UK. They had asked me to join them but for many reasons including my attachment to the patients at the Avenue although tempted I had declined to take up the offer.<br />\nPeter duly went for his appointment and indeed was seen late. I made no comment. Following the consultation the receptionist had made an appointment to see the surgeon the following week and gave him a letter to take with him. He was then asked to pay 23\u20ac for the consultation at the same time the receptionist put the Carte Vitale in the machine. His contribution was 1\u20ac whilst the rest was reimbursed.</p>\n<p><strong>What is a Carte Vitale?</strong><br />\nThe Carte Vitale is the health insurance card of the national health care system in France. It was introduced in 1998 to allow a direct settlement with the medical arm of the social insurance system.<br />\nThe card itself is not a means of payment, but a means of easier reimbursement. You should normally expect to receive reimbursement directly into your bank account within a week and the amount reimbursed depends on personal factors but everyone pays a small amount. All residents in France are legally required to have a health insurance as a top up to your public health entitlement, whether through public and/or private coverage. The public health entitlement (and other social security benefits) depends on a number of factors, including nationality, residency status, work status and contribution to the system.<br />\nEveryone aged 16+ years of age is required to have one. Children under 16 years are included on the card of their parent or guardian.</p>\n<p>Where there are excess medical charges (called d\u00e9passements) over the official tariffs you may be able to get reimbursement from your voluntary insurer. If not, the costs fall to you.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/image16.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1163\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/image16.jpg?w=150&#038;h=95\" width=\"150\" height=\"95\" /></a><span style=\"line-height:1.5;\">Vitale card is a microprocessor-based or so-called &#8220;smart&#8221; about the size of a credit card.

We set off on the 21km trek by car as there is no public transport except taxi. It was reasonably easy to park with no charge. When we arrived we were directed to the outpatients.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/image33.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1351\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/image33.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a><br />\nIt is a public Hospital known as The Centre Hospitalier de P\u00e9rigueux, public health facility was opened on its present site in 1953.

All staff were uniformed including the admin staff who wore white pyjamas, also nurses wore white pyjamas with coloured bands to indicate their status and the doctors wore white coats. They were softly spoken but professional and helpful. We waited in a waiting area and everybody respected the quietness. The doctor wearing a white coat passed by with a patient acknowledging our presence and apologised for keeping us a few minutes waiting. He then showed us into a stark room with only a\u00a0desk, several chairs and a telephone. He read the letter and then asked to see Peter in another room for examination. They both reappeared and he agreed it was a hernia and needed surgery. He then took out his diary and asked when would be a convenient date, Peter got out his diary and between \u00a0themselves they arranged a mutually convenient date. He then explained clearly exactly what he was going to do in a mixture of French and English, showing Peter the type of gauze had he would use and suggested that as he was taking a blood thinning drug that he should stay in overnight and he would also see the anaesthetist. He then dictated a letter to his GP and the anaesthetist. He also answered Peter&#8217;s questions patiently. He then sked Peter to write a cheque \u00a0for 42\u20ac slipped it under the phone with the other cheques and at the same time handed a form to reclaim this charge from Peters health insurance.<br />\nA week later we returned to see the anaesthetist. \u00a0Firstly we had to take a number in the main reception area and when called go to the allocated admin staff (a bit like the system at \u00a0Perceval \u00a0House, Ealing ) who then took the Carte Vitale which demonstrates you a resident in France and entitlement for a percentage of medical costs by the state , the remainder of the cost is met by the insurance company and these documents have to be verified before the patient can make arrangements for hospital admission. also it was necessary to produce a photo ID ( passport or ID card)<br />\nFollowing this the proceeded to the area where the anaesthetist\u00a0was consulting. The receptionist looked oddly at me to come forward calling me Peter. However, it turned out that most of the patients were antenatal and her expression was indicating that not only had I had an unusual female name but perhaps I looked a little old to be pregnant.<br />\nThe patient established we saw the anaesthetist who quizzed Peter about his past medical history and current medication,examined him and the asked him to go into the next room to have blood taken and an ECG tracing by the nurse.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/image6.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1294\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/image6.jpg?w=150&#038;h=148\" width=\"150\" height=\"148\" /></a>The nurse then issued Peter with 2 bottles of Betadine to be applied over the whole body including the hair on the evening prior to surgery and the morning of the surgery, no food or drinks from the night before and to arrive at the hospital at 7am.</p>\n<p>We were then told to return to reception to make the appointment to see the anaesthetist and receive paperwork and instructions of what to do prior to admission. The receptionist then arranged the overnight stay and if he wanted a single room that would be 4o\u20ac extra to be paid after the stay.</p>\n<p>On the day of the surgery we set off at 6.15am by car in pitch black down country lanes and only the occasional lorry or car to the hospital. As we entered the town the only activity was bakeries selling bread and the bar tabac selling coffee and newspaper and cigarettes. When we arrived at the hospital we trailed down endless corridors into the silent stillness of the hospital to be welcomed by 2 nurses ( one of which turned out to be from the next village)who showed Peter to his room. He was asked to robe in a gown and the a careful inventory was taken of his belongings including watch, mobile phone including the make (although of antique value only) whether there was a charger,rings, money- notes and coins and items of clothing. He was then asked to show ID ( passport, DVLA or ID card ) He was then challenged as to whether he had washed with Betadine evening and morning ( after admitting he had used deodorant under his arms he was sent to the bathroom to apply Betadine under the arms). He was quizzed as to when he had last eaten, whether he wore glasses and how many pairs he had with him, did he have false teeth, similarly if he had a hearing aid and as he some dropping of the mouth from an old nerve problem whether he could manage normal food. Also asked if he wanted to use the TV and then was shown how the mechanism of the bed operated. This was all documented .<br />\nI was asked to leave to learn the room, whilst the nurse attended to him. He reported \u00a0that they had asked him if he had urinated that morning and then proceeded to shave him from the level of the umbilicus to the the mid thighs and everywhere in between! He was then given a tablet to relax him as he began to doze and adorned with mop cap a porter soon appeared to take Peter to theatre and I made a hasty retreat.<br />\nHe told me subsequently that when he arrived in the theatre where he was then asked to transfer to the operating couch and wheeled into theatre and didn&#8217;t remember anything until he woke in his bed feeling parched. Eventually the surgeon did his round at about 6pm checked his wound and gave him permission to have a light supper &#8211; three course as the usual in France and all in sealed containers.</p>\n<p>The view from the window was merely other hospital buildings but he was entertained by the starlings gathering on the communication wires constantly jostling for position until an unbeknown signal gave rise to a sudden departure in a large black cloud.(mobile phones are useful to capture these moments!)<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/image34.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1352\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/image34.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a><br />\nHe was able to phone me to say all was well so far and he was in no pain (there is a hospital policy,as stated in their brochure to aim to keep patients pain-free). He had a poor night but he found the nurses attentive and reassuring. The next morning breakfast arrived a few biscuits with butter and jam and a bowl of an apology for tea!! He was then told he could wash in the ensuite bathroom and dress but again with an offer of help. Throughout this experience he felt nothing was too much trouble for the nurses and they were thoughtful and reassuring. He was someone who had experienced previous hospital admissions and had been fearful on this occasion, which is normal as people get older and are aware that there can be complications, which friends are only too glad to share!<br />\nHe rested during the morning and after the three course lunch soup, celeriac and paupiette de veau followed by a yogurt all in sealed packaging. \u00a0The surgeon arrived to discharge him after further inspection and advise regarding driving and completing the hand written records and \u00a0a prescription and instructions for the nurse to remove the clips after 10 days.<br />\nI arrived to collect him and the nurse passed over the papers and he was told to collect the prescription for dressings and painkillers from the pharmacy and then phone the nurse to visit him at home to attend the wound. Then we went to the hospital administration to make the final settlement including paying for the overnight stay in a single room which would have been 37\u20ac but as all the rooms for It is of note that nurses have a practise run from their own surgery premises and can ask patients to attend but usually they visit the home post operatively.</p>\n<p>On arriving home he rang the nurse&#8217;s home to arrange the visit. He had previously seen nurse Leblanc for home nursing and asked to speak to her and she replied it was her speaking but strangely did not know his house and sounded different&#8230; All was revealed when it turned out Nurse Leblanc who he spoke to was the daughter-in-law and Nurse Leblanc \u00a0had divorced and remarried. The male nurse had been dismissed as he had made fraudulent claims all because he wanted a \u00a0fast car and a bigger house! \u00a0Sounded like something out of a soap opera&#8230;..</p>\n<p>The nurse called at the house every other morning with both nurses alternating. \u00a0They left their instruments in a well used tin case at the house and sterilised them by wiping with Betadine and did not use gloves. Nevertheless, the wound healed beautifully and each visit the nurse advised gentle mobilisation. Unbeknown to them he had driven the tractor around the garden!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/image30.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1348\" alt=\"Card reader\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/image30.jpg?w=150&#038;h=112\" width=\"150\" height=\"112\" /></a>At the end of each dressing each nurse recorded the visit by putting the Carte Vitale into a card reader and a cheque was made out for 30\u20ac most of which is reimbursed.</p>\n<p>The wound healed very well and after 6 weeks he was seen by the surgeon for review. He was satisfied that the operation was satisfactory and he was discharged.</p>\n<p>Overall, this was an extremely satisfactory experience and an insight into French medical care.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/image35.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1353\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/image35.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\n<p>More insights into how the Hospital is organised can be found on the link below<br />\n<strong><a href=\"http://etablissements.hopital.fr/annuaire_structure.php?id=521\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://etablissements.hopital.fr/annuaire_structure.php?id=521</a></strong></p>\n", "post_id": 1133, "location": false, "date": "12-22-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["BVS", "DES", "BMS", "Chest pain", "Health", "angina", "Coronary artery disease", "CAD"], "text": "<p>During the heavy snow in 1980&#8242;s I was working as a GP in South Wales and after heavy blizzards I had woken up to find that I was literally trapped in the snow .

We soon set up an emergency plan to manage our patients. We spoke to patients on the phone and then if appropriate we arranged delivery of medication. Local young men rallied together with their motorbikes and set up a courier service and prided themselves by getting medication delivered in record time whilst able residents cleared paths and roads. At the time there was great enthusiasm regarding CBR(Citizens Band Radio) and they facilitated communication between couriers as well as helping those people who had no telephone or connection. It was interesting because most calls were about getting their sick certificates or their Valium prescriptions!!<br />\nWhen the snow cleared surgeries were busy and I particularly remember one consultation about 2 weeks later.<br />\n&#8220;Dr when we were cut off the Brains (beer) lorry couldn&#8217;t get up the hill to the club and I had to help by pushing a barrel by hand and during that time I had an awful pull&#8221;. (A common description which could mean anything) &#8220;What do you mean by that?&#8221; I asked. He responded immediately with a distorted facial expression,&#8221;I had an awful gripping feeling across my chest&#8221;,he said, clenching his fist and pressing on the middle of his chest. I don&#8217;t know how I got the barrel through the door, good job someone was there to help and I came over very cold and sweaty so Dai, the bar man had to pour me a stiff brandy&#8221;.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/image19.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-1168\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/image19.jpg?w=251&#038;h=201\" width=\"251\" height=\"201\" /></a><br />\n( the resounding, stuttering words of Dr Byron Evans, consultant physician &amp; medical tutor in medical school whilst on a ward round came to me, &#8220;Listen here,good boys, if ever you hear a man describe a gripping chest pain and he clenches his fist and draws it to the centre of his chest it has to be cardiac&#8221; and he repeated it in Welsh with even greater gusto).<br />\nI gently explained that to \u00a0that he had probably had a heart attack and prescribed some GTN tablets to put under the tongue if the pain should recur as there was no other specific treatment and getting an ECG was not easy to arrange. At that time a study had been shown that a patients survival rate was greater if they stayed at home especially as ambulances were minimally equipped and the nearest hospital was 20miles away and coronary care units had not evolved generally.<br />\nIf the pain did recur these patients often became more and more incapacitated to the point that they became bed bound and were called &#8216;cardiac cripples&#8217; I remember one such patient that I visited frequently and every time a new drug appeared in the form of slow release GTN he was willing to be the &#8216;guinea pig&#8217; I got to know him very well and on the visits we used to discuss the many photos of pigeons he had decorating his living room and talk about the ins and outs of rearing racing pigeons and where he used to &#8216;toss&#8217; them.<br />\nIt was about this time that cardiologists were beginning to perform angioplasties far away in London and if I wanted to refer a patient for an angiogram and or angioplasty they had to travel to London. Many people were fearful of going as several had not come back or returned having had a stroke.</p>\n<p>It was not until 1986 that bare metal stents(BMS)were implanted into the coronary arteries.<br />\nSince that time preventative measures and treatment has evolved so that peoples lives have been extended and the quality of life improved. Patients at risk are now actively encouraged to change their lifestyle &#8211; smoking cessation, low fat diets and regular exercise and medicines such as statins and beta-blockers have decreased mortality by as much as 25%. Investigation by angiogram has led to better understanding of coronary artery disease.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/image20.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1169\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/image20.jpg?w=214&#038;h=184\" width=\"214\" height=\"184\" /></a><br />\nFrom 1994 implantation of stents has become common place and several generations of bare metal stents (BMS) have been developed often using cobalt chrome alloy.<br />\nThe permanence of these metallic stents is not considered ideal as they can induce late clotting (thrombosis).<br />\nAlso, although these stents are highly successful and most people have had significant improvement of symptoms the rate of restenosis (re-narrowing of the treated artery) causes limitation and often results in having to repeat the procedure.</p>\n<p>This has led to the development of the DES (drug-routing stents) in 2003. These stents are coated with a special material that release (elutes) a drug(such as paclitaxel, sirolimus or tacrolimus) over a period of 30-90 days in order to reduce restenosis. The polymer coating degrades by the time the drug has been released and the metallic structure remains. DES are more expensive than BMS and are not necessarily superior in terms of reducing death, heart attack or thrombosis. According to NICE, the decision to use either a BMS or a DES should be based on the anatomy of the target vessel and the symptoms and mode of the disease.</p>\n<p>During the past 3 yrs Bioresorbable stents (BVS), also referred to as <strong>vascular scaffolds</strong>, represent a new concept in stents for treating coronary artery disease. Stents are vascular scaffolds that are used to hold open a blocked vessel to restore blood flow to the heart.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/image21.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1170\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/image21.jpg?w=300&#038;h=253\" width=\"300\" height=\"253\" /></a></p>\n<p>Bioresorbable stents are designed to slowly disappear over time, leaving patients with a treated vessel free of a permanent implant. With no material left behind, the vessel has the potential to return to a more natural state and function reducing the risk of late thrombosis. Other advantages may include:<br />\n\uf0b7 A reduction in the risk of bleeding complications which can be caused by anti-clotting treatments.<br />\nAnti-clotting therapy, with two anti-platelet drugs, is given after a stent is implanted, and it may be that bioresorbable stents require a shorter period of this treatment because of resorption of the device. However, some patients may still need long term anti-clotting treatments because of their underlying heart condition.<br />\n\uf0b7 Patient acceptability. Some patients may prefer a temporary implant rather than a permanent one.</p>\n<p>Five bioresorbable stents are in various stages of development. So far, clinical studies are encouraging and have shown that bioresorbable stents may offer an additional option to current stents.</p>\n<p>On September 25th 2012 Abbott announced that Absorb\u2122, the world&#8217;s first drug eluting bioresorbable vascular scaffold (BVS), and it is now widely available across Europe and parts of Asia Pacific and Latin America. Absorb is a first-of-its-kind device for the treatment of coronary artery disease (CAD).<br />\nWe are awaiting long term follow up&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..</p>\n<p>If you want to find out more patient information about angioplasty and insertion of stents use the following link:-<br />\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.bhf.org.uk/heart-health/treatment/coronary-angioplasty-and-stent.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.bhf.org.uk/heart-health/treatment/coronary-angioplasty-and-stent.aspx</a></strong></p>\n", "post_id": 1160, "location": false, "date": "10-24-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Jesse Boot", "John Boot", "Somme", "Amputation", "Sherwood Foresters", "Boots", "Pharmacy", "Nottingham", "Health", "Robin Hoods", "Artificial Limb", "St Mary's Roehampton"], "text": "<p>I remember my grandfather as the archetypal grandfather, gentle ,congenial,white hair, wooden leg, walking with a stick and &#8216;tuffies&#8217; (Nuttall&#8217;s Mintoes) as he called them in his pockets and some one who gave you everything you wanted and did whatever you wanted!<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/image31.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1207\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/image31.jpg?w=150&#038;h=140\" alt=\"image\" width=\"150\" height=\"140\" /></a><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/image32.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-1208\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/image32.jpg?w=150&#038;h=112\" alt=\"image\" width=\"150\" height=\"112\" /></a> In 1916 my grandfather came back to his home town Nottingham from the First World War having served in one of the Robin Hood Battalions as part of the Forester Brigade of the Sherwood Foresters and had been one of the few survivors of the cruel Battle of the Somme. He had lied about his age and at the tender age of 16yrs, this country lad had signed up to fight for Queen and country and counted himself as very lucky to have survived. Although he had survived he had suffered a severe injury in his leg and it was necessary to have it amputated in the trenches.<br />\nBut, when such large numbers of wounded men began returned from the Western Front, the existing system of limb provision couldn\u2019t cope. In 1915, the crisis was partially addressed by the opening of Queen Mary\u2019s Hospital at Roehampton, a hospital dedicated to fitting artificial limbs two years later,<br />\nA photograph of soldiers wounded during the Battle of the Somme, taken by an unknown photographer in 1916.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/image42.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1219\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/image42.jpg?w=300&#038;h=250\" alt=\"image\" width=\"300\" height=\"250\" /></a><br />\n<em>&#8220;Next to the loss of life, the sacrifice of a limb is the greatest sacrifice that a man can make for his country.&#8221;<br />\nThe Times, 1920</em><br />\nEvery night without fail he would pause and bow his head. I remember as a small child saying to my grandmother, &#8220;What&#8217;s granddad doing now?&#8221; and her telling me to be quiet whilst he said his prayers thanking God he is alive and praying for those who had fallen in the Great War. It was several years before I understood what she meant. I also puzzled why he would never let me watch him go upstairs and that was because his pride would not let me see him climb stairs on his bottom. I was fascinated by his artificial leg and watched him whilst he struggled with the huge leather straps around his waist and wondered what he as talking about when he talked about &#8216;ghost pains&#8217; in his missing leg. He had developed severe bone infections and needed several follow up amputations to end up with a hind quarter amputation , which were carried out at St Mary&#8217;s Roehampton and then eventually he was fitted with a full length artificial limb. My mother had described the long journeys over many years, when from the age of nine she had accompanied him from Nottingham to have treatment.</p>\n<p>Soldiers wearing artificial limbs having a running race<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/image43.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1221\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/image43.jpg?w=300&#038;h=190\" alt=\"image\" width=\"300\" height=\"190\" /></a></p>\n<p>In those days men were seen as the bread-winners and notions of masculinity meant they were expected to be physically and psychologically strong. Men who became soldiers were considered brave and manly; entering into war enabled a man to show his masculinity. Those disabled by war were therefore seen as different from disabled civilians. Many people felt that injured ex-servicemen were active sufferers and disabled civilians were passive sufferers. This opinion led to uneven healthcare funding and services between the civilian disabled and the injured ex-serviceman. Servicemen who lost a limb were entitled to artificial limbs through the state whereas this entitlement was not available for civilians.<br />\nHe was not able to return to his apprenticeship as a cabinet maker as all machinery relied on using foot pedals but fortunately, he was taken in by Jesse Boot along with many others to be retrained and in his case as a bookbinder.

The shop was on Goose Gate, a short distance away from the family home.<br />\nThe plants for the medicines were collected by John and Mary Boot, who would then make the remedies from the plants.<br />\nAt just 10 years old Jesse\u2019s father died. His mother continued to run the family shop with help from family and friends. As Jesse grew up he began to help by collecting plants from the countryside.<br />\nJesse left school aged 13 and began to do more work in the shops. He would serve behind the counter, prepare the remedies, count the money in the till and stack the shelves. Jesse learnt about running the shop and began to manage it with his mother. When Jesse was 21 he became a partner in \u2018MARY &amp; JESSE BOOT \u2013 HERBALISTS\u2019 as the shop became known.</p>\n<p>Jesse realised that the established chemists in Nottingham had a price-fixing policy. He therefore decided to sell his goods cheaper than the other chemists.<br />\nJessie Boot was a devout Methodist who was deeply concerned about the poverty he saw in Nottingham. He believed that his lower prices would enable the poor to buy goods that previously they could not afford. Later Jesse renamed his shop The People&#8217;s Store. He advertised in the Nottingham Daily Express that the 128 items in his shop at Goose Gate were being sold at reduced prices. He also employed a bell-ringer to tour the streets of Nottingham informing the public of Boot&#8217;s policy.<br />\nJesse&#8217;s talent for business was soon evident. He expanded the range of products he sold to include proprietary medicines and household necessities. He adopted a strategy of buying stock in bulk and selling his goods much cheaper than his competitors, advertising under the slogan <strong>&#8220;Health for a Shilling&#8221;.</strong> This campaign was a great success and within a month the takings of the shop had doubled.</p>\n<p>At that time doctors made up their own prescriptions after diagnosing what was wrong with their patients. The cost of prescriptions were high and this often stopped the poor from receiving the medical help they needed. Boot decided to break this monopoly by employing E. S. Waring, a young chemist, to provide prescriptions. On average the cost of these prescriptions were less than half those charged by the doctors. This was a great success and helped Boot expand his business.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/image38.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1215\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/image38.jpg?w=128&#038;h=300\" alt=\"image\" width=\"128\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<p>The shop changed its name again to \u2018M &amp; J Boot\u2019 in 1877, and again in 1883 to \u2018 Boot and Company Limited\u2019. In the same year the shop was moved along the street into a much bigger store. The new store had room for a shop, offices, and a home above. The new store also had a unique addition \u2013 a lift to take customers to the first floor.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/image23.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1177\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/image23.jpg?w=275&#038;h=183\" alt=\"image\" width=\"275\" height=\"183\" /></a></p>\n<p>With the shop making lots of money Jesse Boot began to expand and open new shops around Nottingham. The following year, in 1884, Jesse Boot opened his first shop outside Nottingham \u2013 in Sheffield.</p>\n<p>During a holiday and rest on the Island of Jersey, Jesse met Florence Rowe. They married and in 1889 they had their first child \u2013 John Boot.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/image24.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1178\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/image24.jpg?w=300&#038;h=194\" alt=\"image\" width=\"300\" height=\"194\" /></a></p>\n<p>Florence helped with the business, and introduced many new ideas to the stores. Instead of selling only remedies and medicines, Boots began to sell books, fancy goods and picture frames. The range of products sold also expanded beyond traditional chemists lines &#8211; from stationery, to silverware and picture framing, as well as the introduction of new services like Booklovers Libraries and Cafes in the larger stores.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/image39.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1216\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/image39.jpg?w=300&#038;h=180\" alt=\"image\" width=\"300\" height=\"180\" /></a></p>\n<p>Many of these new lines and services were fostered by Jesse&#8217;s wife, Florence, whom he had married in 1886 (they went on to have three children together &#8211; John, Dorothy and Margery). The growing retail side of the business was partnered by a growth in manufacturing of Boots own brand products and research into new pharmaceuticals and chemicals.</p>\n<p>A new store was built in Pelham Street, Nottingham. This store was the pride of the business and allowed shoppers to shop in the winter evenings thanks to the use of a new idea \u2013 electric lights hanging down from the ceiling.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/image37.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1213\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/image37.jpg?w=250&#038;h=175\" alt=\"image\" width=\"250\" height=\"175\" /></a></p>\n<p>With lots of new shops being opened, Jesse needed a larger factory to make all of the medicines. In 1892 the manufacturing side of Boots moved to factories on Island Street. This site rapidly grew and soon was known as the Island Street works.</p>\n<p>At the turn of the century Boots began to take over other chemists. Shops appeared all over the country, and Boots had become a nationwide company.<br />\n<em>&#8220;We declare-<br />\nFor Pure Drugs<br />\nFor Qualified Assistants<br />\nFor First-class Shops<br />\nFor Reasonable Prices<br />\nFor your Good Health<br />\nFor our Moderate Profits<br />\nWe minister to the comfort of the community in a hundred ways.</em>&#8220;<br />\nJesse Boot, 1897</p>\n<p><em>&#8220;From modest beginnings we are gradually raising to a high pitch that average excellence of equipment and convenience for customers which are the noteworthy features of our establishments, in addition to the good quality of everything we sell.</em><br />\nJesse Boot, 1898</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/image36.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1212\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/image36.jpg?w=250&#038;h=178\" alt=\"image\" width=\"250\" height=\"178\" /></a></p>\n<p>Jesse and Florence took care of their staff as well. They organised regular trips and visits. Sometimes to the countryside for picnics, other times to the seaside. Florence also realised that some of the workers were arriving in the morning without having had breakfast, and so made sure that every worker had a hot cocoa before beginning work.<br />\nThe wellbeing of their employees was very important to Jesse and Florence and they provided welfare, education, sports and social facilities for their growing retail and manufacturing workforce. Full time welfare professionals were employed and a surgery was established at the Island Street site to care for the health of employees. A Day Continuation School (later renamed Boots College) was opened to provide extended academic and vocational education for younger employees. Jesse and Florence enjoyed organising and hosting social events and outings for staff in the early days of the business &#8211; whether it was trips to the seaside or tea parties and musical concerts at their house on the banks of the River Trent. As the number of employees grew, they fostered and helped fund the establishment of numerous sporting and social clubs and societies, with the belief that healthy and happy employees would make Boots a happy and productive place to work.<br />\nI remember my grandparents and mother talking enthusiastically about the trips out. My mother described the trip to Skegness (a Lincolnshire sea-side resort) and how she had been embarrassed because my grandfather had removed his artificial leg (which was now a full hind quarter amputation following recurrent infections) and was diving into the sea from a diving board and people were all going to watch him.</p>\n<p>Jesse Boot claimed,<br />\n<em>&#8220;We are primarily comrades &#8211; and close comrades, moreover &#8211; in business; and this is no mean tie, for business, claiming as it does so much of our time and talents, is a highly important feature in our lives&#8230; If our labour is nothing to us but a means of procuring bread and butter, then our lives must be a poor thankless round of dull task work&#8230; while we are primarily business associates, our mutual interests are by no means restricted to business in any limited sense. Fellowship in recreation, fellowship in ideals, common hopes, common sympathies, and common humanity bind us together; and whatever fosters this happy union is valuable.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>The City of Nottingham also received generous gifts from Jesse Boot. He helped to rebuild the Albert Hall, destroyed by a fire, and also paid for a new organ to be installed. After the Crimean War Jesse built houses for the soldiers to live in.</p>\n<p>In 1909 Jesse Boot was knighted for his hard work and became Sir Jesse Boot.<br />\nAs he grew older he became ill, and suffered with arthritis, but continued to expand his business. By 1913 he had opened 560 shops around the country.<br />\nA photo of a shop in Hartlepool.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/image40.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1217\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/image40.jpg?w=300&#038;h=224\" alt=\"image\" width=\"300\" height=\"224\" /></a></p>\n<p>The running of the company became too difficult and in 1920 Boots was sold to an American for \u00a32\u00bc million. In the same year Jesse Boot gave \u00a350,000 to Nottingham General Hospital, and bought 20 acres of land along the Victoria Embankment &#8211; by the side of the River Trent \u2013 to build a memorial gate and playing fields.</p>\n<p>In 1920 Sir Jesse was given the Freedom of the City by Nottingham.<br />\nFollowing this the same year Boots was taken over by the American, Louis K. Liggett of the United Drug Company and Jesse Boot sold his controlling interest for almost \u00a32.5 million. Now aged seventy, he embarked on an &#8216;orgy&#8217; of spending and in June 1920 offered \u00a3250,000 for a park on the Trent embankment.</p>\n<p>In July he gave \u00a350,000 to the Nottingham General Hospital, in September it was \u00a31,650 towards a club for discharged soldiers and sailors, and in October it was \u00a310,000 to endow professorship of sociology at the Congregational College on Forest Road West. Nottingham had long campaigned to get its own university and after the war a fresh campaign began.<br />\nThe following year he bought Woodthorpe Grange, and gave it to the City. Woodthorpe Grange today is home to Nottingham City&#8217;s Sport, Culture and Parks Service, the maintenance depot for the local area&#8217;s ground maintenance team and the City&#8217;s nursery section.<br />\nHe also gave \u2018Highfields\u2019 &#8211; an area of land he had bought previously \u2013 and \u00a350,000 to begin the construction of Nottingham University. Jesse had been an admirer of the Cadburys at Bourneville and William Lever at Port Sunlight who had housed their workers in decent homes alongside purpose built factories and almost immediately after the end of the First World War, he bought the huge Highfields Estate with the intention of using the splendid wooded site to build another Bourneville. But after the American take-over of the company, it soon became apparent that United Drug were not going to take up Boot&#8217;s scheme for a new model town on the Highfields Estate, so he offered 35 acres of the Estate as a site for the University.<br />\nThe remainder of the 220 acres he decided should be laid out as a pleasure park for the benefit of all in Nottingham. The project was also to include the construction of a \u00a3200,000 road through the Estate to provide a much-needed new route between Nottingham and Beeston. The road, University Boulevard, was raised above the level of the Trent floods by using spoil made available when the existing lake was much enlarged to create the present fifteen-acre boating lake.</p>\n<p>In this public park, which was to have boating lake, pavilion and sports fields, Jesse Boot decided to add the largest inland swimming pool in Britain Highfields Lido.<br />\nJesse Boot engaged a London architect, P. Morley Horder, to design the Trent Building on the University site and he was given the commission for the swimming pool. Until then, Morley Horder&#8217;s work for Boot had mainly been confined to designing the reproduction facades that Jesse Boot so favoured on the frontages of his shops. In his design for the Lido, the architect was concerned to ensure that the buildings around the pool should not lack visual interest. Drawing on the Roman style of architecture, he used red brick walling and pantile roofing and incorporated archways in front of the changing cubicles to break up the line of the buildings. The pool, a massive 330 feet by 75 feet, held over 750,000 gallons of water. The architect drew on a close source of water to fill it at minimal cost. A pipe was laid between the boating lake and the Lido and when water was required, it was drawn off from the lake and pumped into the pool. When the pool was emptied the water was pumped out into the nearby Tottle Brook.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/image35.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1211\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/image35.jpg?w=300&#038;h=211\" alt=\"image\" width=\"300\" height=\"211\" /></a></p>\n<p>During the Summer season, the water was changed in this way each week on a Sunday when the Lido was closed to the public. The architect&#8217;s proud boast was that the only water drawn from the town mains was that used for drinking and in the showers, washbasins and toilets.</p>\n<p>The Lido first opened in August 1924 and local papers for the 15th of August announced that it was&#8217; now open to swimmers who care to take their own costumes and towels&#8217;. My grandfather had learnt to swim at that pool aswell as dive off the boards with his one leg and had taken my mother and uncle regularly. I have to say as a child and teenager I spent many happy days swimming and having picnics there with my grandparents and family</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/image33.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1209\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/image33.jpg?w=300&#038;h=199\" alt=\"image\" width=\"300\" height=\"199\" /></a></p>\n<p>Sir Jesse became \u2018Lord Trent of Nottingham\u2019 in 1928, but had become so ill he spent much of his time in Jersey and France.

It has also been an attempt to educate readers about medical topics aswell as some stories relating to my life as a doctor and tying it in to more recent advances in medicine.</li>\n<li><strong>Clinical Systems </strong> We have been in negotiation most of the year with other doctors in our network and having agreed on a system which would be more patient friendly it has been decided to Ho over to this system after April when the busy winter months are over.</li>\n<li><strong>Patient education</strong> Arranging events in the form of talks has been difficult due to patient&#8217;s availability but by continuing with posters , providing links on our website, patient leaflets and now deciding to focus on particular at risk groups such as the mentally ill we hope this will be an ongoing<br />\nprovision.<strong>PLANS FOR 2013/14</strong></p>\n<p>We have brought up 3 subjects to consider and will sending out a survey completed anonymously to gather information from a wider section of patients</p>\n<p><strong>PREMISES AND MERGER</strong><br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/image25.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1182\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/image25.jpg?w=300&#038;h=213\" width=\"300\" height=\"213\" /></a><br />\nWith reference to a paper brought out earlier in the year in the magazine Commissioning Success a bi-monthly magazine from the team behind Practice Business, aimed at helping clinical commissioners get the best outcomes from clinically-led commissioning.<br />\nCollaborative healthcare \u2018groups\u2019 and informal alliances can work better than formal mergers, says NHS Confederation.<br />\nPublished: MAY 1, 2013</p>\n<p>\u201cThe new options for governing through healthcare groups set out in this paper can strengthen rather than reduce the connections to local people, and help maintain safe local services. They could also mean less upheaval for staff and for patients, many of whom worry that they will lose a valued service or even their job.\u201d</p>\n<p>We discussed the present situation of general Practise and how small practises are becoming less viable and ways in which we could consider keeping the personal touch we have created in a small practise. However, being realistic we must now consider sharing facilities with other nearby practises and with a new computer system where access to notes would be more obtainable by other doctors we could reduce waiting times and share resources.<br />\nWe have already begun to collaborate with other practises in our network (about 10 practises) in Commissioning services such as anticoagulation and community run musculoskeletal-skeletal services but we need to think of ways to facilitate services at a practise level for more everyday services and how we can satisfy CQC inspectors with regard to standard of premises.<br />\nThe survey will provide more feedback from our patients on this topic.</p>\n<p><strong>OUT OF HOURS and A&amp;E</strong><br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image10.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-170\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image10.jpg?w=250&#038;h=39\" width=\"250\" height=\"39\" /></a><br />\nThis has been an ongoing topic in the national news for some time and recently I have been asking patients what they would do if they needed a doctor out of hours and was surprised at the lack of knowledge. This prompted me to write the blog on 111 and please read this if you haven&#8217;t already done so. The NHS is wasting phenomenal amount of money asking highly qualified health professionals to deal with health problems which could be dealt with in the home or visiting a local pharmacy. Splinters, common cold, flu, simple cuts, bruises and sprains and domestic worries are not reasons for attending A&amp;E or calling an ambulance. Believe it or not that is what I see every time I do an Out of Hours session at one of our local hospitals. Again refer to this blog which outlines what to do if you have a medical problem out of hours.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.wordpress.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1109&#038;action=edit\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://102theavenue.wordpress.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1109&#038;action=edit</a></p>\n<p><strong>PRESCRIBING AND MEDICINES WASTAGE</strong><br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image71.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-384\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image71.jpg?w=300&#038;h=212\" width=\"300\" height=\"212\" /></a><br />\nAnother topical cause of concern has been medicine wastage and we need to educate patients how to avoid this. We as doctors meet regularly with a prescribing advisor and we work closely with a prescribing pharmacist to find ways in which we as doctors avoid waste and to consider cost-effective prescribing. By doing this there is more chance that there will be money in the pot for expensive medication for conditions such as cancer.

These mushroom, when eaten produce hallucinations and sometimes, can cause disorientation, fatigue,vomiting and can give abdominal pains or diarrhoea. There are records of their use in different parts of the World by many ancient civilisations. When these children were admitted together there was absolute chaos on the ward as they effected the children in different ways.

In more scientific terms, a number of compounds in fungi have been found to stimulate the function of the immune system, inhibit tumor growth and boost intestinal flora. Particularly, mushroom substances called terpenoids help kill bacteria and viruses and exert anti-inflammatory effects, while complex chain-like sugars called polysaccharides have been shown to exert antitumor and immuno-stimulating properties. &#8211; The Natural Foods Merchandiser, March 2005<br />\n<strong>Chanterelles</strong><br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/image51.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-1392\" alt=\"Mushroom stall\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/image51.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>I managed to buy some white Chanterelles ( Cantharellus subalbidus)<br />\nfrom the market carefully gathered by an expert and I carefully prepared them and fried them in cr\u00e8me fraiche, seasoned with garlic and parsley <a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/image44.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-1385\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/image44.jpg?w=259&#038;h=194\" width=\"259\" height=\"194\" /></a>as instructed by my expert (stall holders in the market love to advise you how to cook their produce) and served with chicken escalope.<br />\nOur ancestors would certainly have eaten them and they would have been gathered by peasants throughout history, with these and truffles, peasant food wasn\u2019t too bad, although of course such food is seasonal with chanterelles being found mainly in the spring and autumn or in <a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/image49.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-1390\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/image49.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>the rainy seasons. Traditionally mushrooms particularly chanterelles have been assumed to be aphrodisiacs, with the 11th century Normans in Britain feeding them to grooms at their wedding feasts. The minerals they contain along with the amino acids and vitamins, probably make them good for the libido, especially for men with erectile dysfunctions.<br />\nChanterelles have an affinity with certain trees and particularly birch, beech, oak, and pine in descending order, as they seem to like birch trees best, but they also seem to quite like larch and sweet chestnut trees too. They grow in soil which is damp, but not swampy or marshy ground.<br />\nIf you go picking them, make sure that you wash them thoroughly and clean the gills. This is best done with a soft toothbrush.<br />\nThey are great added to soups and stews and go well with eggs, but can be used to accompany any meat dish. Treat them as you would any other mushroom as far as cooking goes. Personally I love them and am always happy when I find them either in woods or in the market as I did this Autumn and the man proceeded to give me a lesson on how mushrooms grow and how important the climatic conditions have to be &#8211; the temperature, air pressure, amount of rain and sun and the consistency of the soil and the site where they grow . The spore starts to grow about a metre below ground and a fine filament a couple of millimetres thick grows upwards to the surface and if the conditions are right will form a fungi.<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/image48.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1389 aligncenter\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/image48.jpg?w=264&#038;h=300\"   /></a><br />\nLike other mushrooms they contain vitamins A and D as well as some of the B-complex ones. They contain all the essential amino acids and glutamic acid is believed to boost the immune system and may help fight cancer, infections and rheumatoid arthritis. There is evidence that it inhibits blood clotting, which is valuable in the fight against heart disease. As for minerals, they contain potassium which regulates blood pressure and the contractions of the heart muscle; copper, manganese, magnesium, calcium, zinc and selenium which is good for the mood and the brain</p>\n<p><strong>Oyster Mushrooms</strong><br />\nI wanted to include this mushroom which you will see on the shelves of your local <a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/image53.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1394\" alt=\"Oyster mushroom\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/image53.jpg?w=150&#038;h=112\" width=\"150\" height=\"112\" /></a>supermarket and has particularly good cholesterol lowering properties.<br />\nPleurotus ostreatus, the oyster mushroom, is a common edible mushroom.

It can be localised or more generalised and can be referred from a site where the cause of pain originates.

It is one of the reasons why I took up acupuncture and studied Traditional Chinese Medicine(TCM) in an attempt to treat pain with something other than tablets, capsules or applications as well as develop a deeper understanding of pain and how it can be treated.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/image50.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1323\" alt=\"Pain words\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/image50.jpg?w=272&#038;h=185\" width=\"272\" height=\"185\" /></a></p>\n<p>Pain can be described using many adjectives such as shooting, burning, stinging, stabbing, throbbing and pricking but these all not only describe the unpleasant sensation but have association with a frightening experience. Hence, with pain there is usually a feeling of fear or emotion of some kind. I attended two lectures a few years ago; one was from an eminent American psychiatrist talking about the neurophysiology of depression and how depression could present with pain such as back pain, chronic abdominal pain or headaches and how these pains could be treated with antidepressants medication. The second lecture was from a Swedish neurophysiologist who impressed us by drawing intricate nerve pathways to demonstrate how acupuncture worked bug also by treating pain this could treat depression.</p>\n<p>Many years ago it seemed appropriate that when I carried out intricate procedures on very premature babies that because I assumed that it must be painful, it was remarked by nursing staff that when I made the effort to talk reassuringly and stroke them the procedure went more smoothly but analgesia was never routinely given.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/image26.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1330\" alt=\"Premature baby\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/image26.jpg?w=300&#038;h=180\" width=\"300\" height=\"180\" /></a><br />\nIt was not until 2010 that research showed that premature babies do perceive pain and are now given analgesia routinely when procedures are performed. Infact premature babies are sensitised to pain by intensive care treatments they receive after birth, a study in 2010 suggested. Tests showed that pre-term infants that have spent at least 40 days in hospital feel pain more acutely than healthy newborns. From this study it was suggested that better pain relief should be given to premature babies under intensive care to prevent them becoming pain-sensitive. Brain activity comparing full-term babies and premature babies was seen when both sets of babies were gently touched on the heel and showed no difference, suggesting that the sensitisation of pre-term babies is specific to pain. This is important, since the sense of touch is triggered by being held or cuddled. It implies that premature babies can benefit from a mother&#8217;s touch as much as normal infants.</p>\n<p>I remember a child coming to surgery with his mother in floods of tears and when I asked &#8216;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; He said&#8221; A lion bit my ear!&#8221; Clearly he felt the sensation of pain but expressed a terrifying fear of how it had occurred. Pain from an acute ear infection is probably for many children their first experience of severe pain and not only do they need pain relief but they need comfort and reassurance.</p>\n<p>My personal experience of severe pain was when I was admitted with renal colic as a medical student and realising it was &#8216;for real&#8217; not one of those pains that all medical students have as they study every speciality. I remember being petrified wondering, imagining what it was and although it was thoughtful to put me in a sideward I felt abandoned and desperate wondering if anyone realised how much pain I was suffering. I was given intramuscular pain relief, which gave me florid hallucinations of Monty Python feet descending on me and those around me changing in form in seconds. I was violently vomiting and terrified and this lasted several days. Then a very gentle doctor sat by my bed explained exactly what was happening and how the stone was working its way out of my system and if not it would be removed surgically next morning. He also listened to the effects I described( this drug has subsequently been taken out of use) changed the medication and then said in a gentle kind manner that if I felt distressed he was prepared to come and see me anytime. The pain instantly became more tolerable and I was able to cope much better feeling less fearful and knew it was happening. Much to the consultants chagrin, as he had come especially early to perform the surgery, about 10 minute before surgery I passed the stone! I never saw the kind doctor again but he taught me what was meant by bedside manner and what being a doctor was really all about &#8211; having the knowledge but combined with the gift of being able to allay fear by giving the time when it is needed.</p>\n<p>Several cases of severe pain puzzled me for years and interestingly all were in severely mentally ill patients.<br />\nThe first case was a gentleman who walked into A&amp;E looking pale, cold and clammy holding his fist against his chest but not complaining of any pain despite being asked several times. A routine ECG was performed, at that time performed on all patients &gt;50 yrs and this showed a massive hear attack across the anterior part of his heart.</p>\n<p>The second case was of a gentleman again walking into A&amp;E vomiting copious amounts of brown fluid clutching his distended, rigid abdomen but showing no history of pain and on palpating his abdomen no complaints of pain but X-ray corfirmed an obstruction with perforation and emergency surgery revealed widespread peritonitis.</p>\n<p>The third case was that of a gentleman who had had a severe mental breakdown whilst working in the City as an analyst and had been treated for skin cancer and was attending a follow up appointment and it was found that he had spinal bone metastases. The day prior to being seen he had walked 7 miles on a country ramble, sadly a week later of widespread metastatic cancer.</p>\n<p>The final case I would like to mention was that of a lady who I had been seeing in surgery regularly and knew she had a diagnosis of severe dissociative disorder,which had been the result of years of abuse in her childhood and early teens. Dissociative disorder is a condition whereby your sense of reality and who you are, which depends on your feelings, thoughts, sensations, perceptions and memories becomes \u2018disconnected\u2019 from each other, and doesn&#8217;t register in your conscious mind. Your sense of identity, your memories, and the way you see yourself and the world around you will change. This is what happens when you dissociate. It\u2019s as if your mind is not in your body; as if you are looking at yourself from a distance; like looking at a stranger. She had been developing swelling of her joints which looked as if they should be painful but she denied severe pain and the distribution of the joint problem was typical of rheumatoid arthritis. I performed the relevant blood tests which came back extremely high supportive of the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis . After consultation with the rheumatologist she was seen and given high doses of intramuscular steroids. She then had to have surgery to her cervical spine as she was at serious risk of becoming paralysed from the neck down due to extensive disease in this area. She has been on many powerful drugs for rheumatoid arthritis but is now taking regular injections of an immunosuppressant treatment called adalimumab (Humira) which is a Tumour necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors (TNF-alpha inhibitors) &#8211; the human body produces tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). TNF-alpha is an inflammatory substance. TNF-alpha inhibitors are used for the reduction of pain, morning stiffness and swollen or tender joints. These drugs are only used in exceptional cases of Rheumatoid Arthritis.</p>\n<p>Pain can be helpful in diagnosing a problem. Without pain, you might seriously harm yourself without knowing it, or you might not realize you have a medical problem that needs treatment as in the case of those mentally ill patients. I realise many people are brought up not to make a fuss about pain but it is important that the symptoms of pain are shared with your doctor and necessary investigations are done, as treating an underlying cause can often cure the pain. However, sometimes pain goes on for weeks, months or even years. This is called chronic pain and it has been found that a pain cycle evolves as shown below:-</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/image27.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1331\" alt=\"Pain cycle\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/image27.jpg?w=300&#038;h=256\" width=\"300\" height=\"256\" /></a></p>\n<p>Sometimes chronic pain is due to an ongoing cause but sometimes the cause is unknown and usually there is a psychological element to a greater or lesser extent. The pain may occur because the brain can\u2019t make enough endorphins. These are chemicals that shut down pain signals. Or, pain signals continue after an injury has healed. In some cases, increased pain sensitivity makes even minor injuries very painful.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/image25.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1329\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/image25.jpg?w=300&#038;h=208\" width=\"300\" height=\"208\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>The British Pain Society</strong> is the largest multidisciplinary professional organisation in the field of pain within the UK.</p>\n<p>Our membership comprises doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, scientists, psychologists, occupational therapists and other healthcare professionals actively engaged in the diagnosis and treatment of pain and in pain research for the benefit of patients.<br />\nIt has published several publications which can be easily downloaded<br />\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.britishpainsociety.org/patient_publications.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.britishpainsociety.org/patient_publications.htm</a></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Managing pain effectively using &#8216;Over the Counter&#8217; (OTC) Medicines (2010)</li>\n<li>Understanding and Managing Pain (2010)</li>\n<li>Help the Aged &#8211; Pain in Older People: Reflections and Experiences from an older person&#8217;s persepctive (2008)</li>\n<li>Opioids for persistent pain: information for patients (2010)</li>\n<li>Managing Cancer Pain &#8211; information for patients (2010)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is very important to communicate how your pain effects you describing it carefully , what you do to ease it and what makes it worse and how intense it is using a scale as below:-</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/image28.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1333\" alt=\"Pain scale\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/image28.jpg?w=300&#038;h=161\" width=\"300\" height=\"161\" /></a></p>\n<p>It is useful to keep a diary either using a calendar or using an App<br />\nThis helps to communicate progress that is being made and how it is affecting daily life.</p>\n<p>Pain can be classified into several categories:-</p>\n<p><strong>Nociceptive Pain: </strong></p>\n<p>Nociceptive pain is believed to be caused by the ongoing activation of pain receptors in either the surface or deep tissues of the body. There are two types: &#8220;somatic&#8221; pain and &#8221; visceral&#8221; pain.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/image23.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1327\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/image23.jpg?w=239&#038;h=211\" width=\"239\" height=\"211\" /></a><br />\n<strong>&#8220;Somatic&#8221;</strong> pain is caused by injury to skin, muscles, bone, joint, and connective tissues. Deep somatic pain is usually described as dull or aching, and localized in one area. Somatic pain from injury to the skin or the tissues just below it often is sharper and may have a burning or pricking quality.</p>\n<p>Somatic pain often involves inflammation of injured tissue. Although inflammation is a normal response of the body to injury, and is essential for healing, inflammation that does not disappear with time can result in a chronically painful disease. The joint pain caused by rheumatoid arthritis may be considered an example of this type of somatic nociceptive pain.</p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;Visceral&#8221;</strong> pain refers to pain that originates from ongoing injury to the internal organs or the tissues that support them. When the injured tissue is a hollow structure, like the intestine or the gall bladder, the pain often is poorly localized and cramping. When the injured structure is not a hollow organ, the pain may be pressure-like, deep, and stabbing.</p>\n<p><strong>Neuropathic Pain:</strong></p>\n<p>Neuropathic pain is believed to be caused by changes in the nervous system that sustain pain even after an injury heals. In most cases, the injury that starts the pain involves the peripheral nerves or the central nervous system itself. It can be associated with trauma or with many different types of diseases, such as diabetes. There are many neuropathic pain syndromes, such as diabetic neuropathy, trigeminal neuralgia, postherpetic neuralgia (&#8220;shingles&#8221;), post-stroke pain, and complex regional pain syndromes (also called reflex sympathetic dystrophy or &#8220;RSD&#8221; and causalgia). Some patients who get neuropathic pain describe it as bizarre, unfamiliar pain, which may be burning or like electricity. The pain may be associated with sensitivity of the skin.</p>\n<p>An interesting account of the mystery of chronic neuropathic pain</p>\n<p>click on link below:-</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/elliot_krane_the_mystery_of_chronic_pain.html?source=email#.UrVy5CT6ph5.email\">Mystery of chronic pain</a></p>\n<p><strong>Psychogenic Pain:</strong><br />\nMost patients with chronic pain have some degree of psychological disturbance. Patients may be anxious or depressed, or have trouble coping. Psychological distress may not only be a consequence of the pain, but may also contribute to the pain itself. &#8220;Psychogenic&#8221; pain is a simple label for all kinds of pain that can be best explained by psychological problems.</p>\n<p>This close relationship between pain and psychological distress means that all patients with chronic pain should have an assessment of these psychological factors, and psychological treatments should be considered an important aspect of pain therapy. In some cases, psychological problems appear to be a main cause of the pain. This does not mean that the person is not actually experiencing the pain. Rather, the patient is truly suffering but the main cause somehow relates to the emotions, or to learning, or to some other psychological process. Although doctors sometimes encounter patients who pretend to be in pain (some can be called malingerers), this appears to be a rare occurrence. Most patients with pain that appears to be determined primarily by psychological processes are hurting just like those who have pain associated with a clear injury to the body.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, psychogenic pain occurs in the absence of any identifiable disease in the body. More often, there is a physical problem but the psychological cause for the pain is believed to be the major cause for the pain.</p>\n<p>Another website which gives interesting insights into pain is:-<br />\n<strong><a href=\"http://painconcern.org.uk\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://painconcern.org.uk</a></strong><br />\nIt also has a series of podcasts which talk about various aspects of pain the edition talks about exploring the possibility of controlling pain through techniques that focus on the brain and the mind using mindfulness a topic I wrote about in a previous blog.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1326\" style=\"width: 160px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/image22.jpg\"><img class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-1326\" alt=\"Pain\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/image22.jpg?w=150&#038;h=27\" width=\"150\" height=\"27\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Pain</p></div>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://audioboo.fm/boos/1709910-airing-pain-programme-47-the-power-of-the-mind-05-11-13\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://audioboo.fm/boos/1709910-airing-pain-programme-47-the-power-of-the-mind-05-11-13</a></strong></p>\n<p>Because chronic pain is so complex, there are often multiple treatment goals. These goals may include more comfort (being &#8220;pain-free&#8221; is often not possible when pain has become chronic), better physical functioning, improved coping and less distress, getting back to work, helping the family cope, and other positive outcomes. To accomplish these goals, chronic pain often is best managed using what is called a &#8220;multimodality&#8221; approach.</p>\n<p>The patient&#8217;s response to therapies may be influenced by age, gender, race or ethnicity, cultural beliefs, or any of a variety of physical, emotional, social, family, occupational, and spiritual circumstances. Treatments for pain must be tailored to the individual, based on each person&#8217;s unique condition.</p>\n<p>A multimodality approach to chronic pain includes a combination of therapies selected from eight broad categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>drug therapies</li>\n<li>psychological therapies</li>\n<li>rehabilitative therapies</li>\n<li>anesthesiological therapies</li>\n<li>neurostimulatory therapies</li>\n<li>surgical therapies</li>\n<li>lifestyle changes</li>\n<li>complementary and alternative medicine therapies</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In many cases, a multimodality strategy requires the involvement of several types of health care professionals -the interdisciplinary team.</p>\n<p>Effective pain management is therefore collaborative in nature, involving good communication among the patient, family, and the practitioners involved in the care. A sense of partnership in trying to find the best therapeutic approach promotes the most creative, and ultimately the most effective, approaches. Patient-practitioner partnership can maximize the patient&#8217;s involvement and sense of control in the healing process. Patients must feel empowered to seek the best care and to act in a way that uses their own resources in the service of health. If an interdisciplinary team of practitioners is involved in developing a multimodality approach, the members must communicate freely to ensure the appropriate targeting of therapy. Family communication helps promote positive patterns within the family and may reduce the stress caused by prolonged pain and impaired function.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/image29.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-1337\" alt=\"Integrative pain management\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/image29.jpg?w=99&#038;h=150\" width=\"99\" height=\"150\" /></a>From this perspective, Integrative Pain Therapy is a natural extension of state-of-the-art conventional pain management.</p>\n<p><strong>Integrative Pain Therapy</strong></p>\n<p>The term, &#8220;integrative pain therapy,&#8221; can be used to describe a broad therapeutic approach to the management of chronic pain, which attempts to combine the best of traditional treatments for pain and disability with the best of the therapies widely considered complementary or alternative. It is part of a larger effort to develop an &#8220;integrative medicine approach&#8221; to many clinical problems.</p>\n<p>This integrative medicine approach links traditional, so-called allopathic, medical treatments with varied complementary and alternative treatments. It is a comprehensive system of medicine, which emphasizes wellness and the healing of the whole person (physical, psychological, social, and spiritual), above and beyond the treatment of any specific symptom or disease (Bell, 2002). It involves the use of all safe and effective therapeutic approaches that can potentially facilitate healing, while empowering the patient to participate in the process of healing. Integrative medicine acknowledges the complexity of health and illness by identifying multiple causes of disease and multiple interventions based on the physical, biochemical, psychological, social and spiritual aspects of health and disease. It recognizes that multiple outcomes may be positive for the individual, and that these outcomes may vary from one person to the next (Rosomoff, 1999).</p>\n<p>The goals of an integrative pain therapy approach may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>reducing or eliminating pain</li>\n<li>using medicines that are appropriate, provide sustained benefits, have tolerable side effects, and support the functional goals of the patient</li>\n<li>reducing distress and enhancing comfort, peace of mind and quality of life</li>\n<li>improving the understanding of the role of emotions, behavior and attitudes in pain</li>\n<li>improving the ability to function physically and perform activities of daily living</li>\n<li>improving the ability to function in social and family roles</li>\n<li>supporting the patient&#8217;s ability to return to work and function on the job</li>\n<li>educating patients in ways to maintain rehabilitation gains and avoid re-injury</li>\n<li>empowering patients to actively participate in pain control strategies</li>\n<li>promoting awareness and understanding of the factors that contribute to physical and emotional distress related to pain</li>\n<li>developing the skills and knowledge needed to increase the patient&#8217;s sense of control over pain</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Integrative pain therapy draws from a broad spectrum of therapeutic approaches. It recognizes the value of multiple approaches to pain management (a multimodality approach) and acknowledges the individualized nature of good medical care. The goal is to employ the safest and most effective therapies to provide maximum benefit.</p>\n<p><strong>Foundations of Health</strong></p>\n<p>In developing an integrative approach to pain therapy, the starting point is a broad view of health and well being. The foundations of health include at least four elements:</p>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li>stress management</li>\n<li>proper diet and nutrition&lt;/li</li>\n<li>regular exercise</li>\n<li>psychosocial support</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p>There are literally thousands of studies confirming the importance of each of these foundations. Careful attention to each can have profound effects on health and illness. The work of Dean Ornish (Ornish, 1999), for example, demonstrated that interventions targeted to these areas can not only halt, but actually reverse, coronary artery disease.<br />\nStress Management.<br />\nAll people experience stress and some degree of stress may be needed to generate excitement, engage fully in tasks, and perform well. However, too much stress, or poor coping with stress, can undermine health and well being.There are many tools available to help reduce the debilitating effects of acute and chronic stress. The most important approach is to recognize triggers and behavior patterns, and to utilize emotional and spiritual approaches to reverse stress&#8217;s negative effects. These approaches can be learned in a variety of ways, such as psychotherapy, education, and training in mind-body techniques. Sometimes, herbal, nutritional or pharmacologic therapies are needed to assist in coping with persistent stress.</p>\n<p><strong>Proper Diet and Nutrition</strong></p>\n<p>Although science has a great deal more to learn about the role of nutrition in health and disease, it is certain that poor nutrition can contribute to a range of problems. Poor nutrition is common in many developing countries, and there is clear evidence that people living in developed countries, such as the United States, may not obtain enough of the essential nutrients needed for maintaining health (Fairfield &amp; Fletcher, 2002). Because the diet may not be a complete source of all the nutrients needed for optimum health, the use of supplements may be necessary, either to help prevent disease or to aid in treatment.</p>\n<p><strong>Exercise</strong></p>\n<p>Proper exercise maintains fitness and is very helpful in reducing stress. Intense aerobic exercise is not necessary to achieve these benefits. Brisk walking may be sufficient for many people. Modest, regular exercise, particularly when combined with stretching and relaxation, or approaches such as yoga and tai chi, provides another essential element for optimum health.</p>\n<p><strong>Psychosocial Support</strong></p>\n<p>There is a huge body of research that demonstrates the importance of psychological and social factors in health and disease. Emotions, thoughts, connections to others, the response of others to our behaviors-all these factors contribute. Dealing with these types of issues and problems is an essential part of pain management.<br />\nAlthough integrative pain therapy as an approach to the management of chronic pain is in its infancy, several recommendations are possible.</p>\n<p>Based on current research the integration of psychological approaches (such as behavioral and relaxation therapies) with conventional medical treatment is strongly recommended for the successful treatment of chronic pain conditions. Some mind/body strategies, like biofeedback, hypnosis, and imagery, are already considered to be mainstream treatments by pain specialists. Others, such as meditation, Qigong, and yoga have extensive historical use and need more study to determine their exact role in an integrative program. The potential benefit of all these approaches is the ability to learn to regulate anxiety, improve coping, and possibly reduce pain.</p>\n<p>Research also supports physical activity and exercise as a part of most treatment programs for chronic pain. For example, active back exercises can be effective in reducing pain intensity, pain frequency and disability, as well as in helping to prevent recurrences of back pain. Activity can be supported by conventional physical therapy and exercise approaches, or by a wide range of movement therapies.</p>\n<p>There is strong support for a treatment strategy that combines therapies that address the physical, psychological and social aspects of chronic pain. Based on a slowly growing experience, the integration of complementary/alternative approaches with standard treatments may offer the best chance of addressing these broad concerns. All patients should be educated about the range of options and the goals of treatment.</p>\n<p>The interdisciplinary approach to chronic pain may involve not only traditional health care providers, including physicians, nurses, psychologists, and physical therapists, but integrative providers comfortable with the widest array of healing modalities, whether conventional or complementary, as well as specialists in specific complementary approaches.</p>\n<p>In Ealing we are fortunate that we have an excellent Community Musculoskeletal service which offers standard treatments alongside Complementary therapy.<br />\nShortly,The Ealing improving access to psychological therapies (IAPT) service offers support for common mental health problems such as depression, anxiety and panic for people living in Ealing.<br />\nIt can provide self-help treatments, cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), counselling and sign-posting to other servces.

The medicinal plant from China is sometimes referred to as Chrysanthemum sinensis, but most modern Chinese material medica texts now classify it as Chrysanthemum moriflolium, the common garden mum or &#8220;florist&#8217;s chrysanthemum&#8221;. All Chrysanthemum flowers can be used medicinally, though in China, those grown in Anhui province are considered to be the best quality.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/image46.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1236\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/image46.jpg?w=223&#038;h=300\"   /></a><br />\nThe Chinese herb usually the white crysanthamum flower (Ju Hua (\u83ca\u82b1))<br />\nmain functions are to:-</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dispel wind, clear heat &#8211; for early stage wind-heat such as colds with fever, headache and red eyes</li>\n<li>Cool the Liver, clear and brighten the eyes &#8211; for eyes that are red, dry, swollen and painful</li>\n<li>Calm the Liver, extinguish wind, descend Liver yang &#8211; in cases of headache and dizziness, or high blood pressure.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The white flowering mums are reported to be higher in flavinoid glycosides and additional active ingredients. Traditionally the white flowers are said to be stronger at calming the Liver and clearing the eyes, while the yellow flowers are stronger at dispelling wind-heat and draining heat toxin.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/image47.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-1237\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/image47.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a><br />\nIt is an ideal tea to have at the end of a stressful day and the<br />\nbenefits of long-term consumption of Chrysanthemum tea have been recognized throughout the history of Chinese medicine.<br />\nIt is said to prevent ageing and to be a favorite of Taoists and poets, though the benefits are achieved only with drinking the tea over a long period of time. In the Shen Nong Ben Cao Jing, it says, &#8220;taken over a long time it facilitates the qi and blood, lightens the body and prevents ageing.&#8221; Chen Shi-Dou explains: &#8220;Sweet Ju Hua is light and clear in flavor and nature, and its effect is particularly leisurely, it must be taken over a long time before it starts to take effect, one cannot just take more to try for earlier results.&#8221;<br />\nProbably the most common combination is with Gou Qi Zi (Goji berries), which nourishes the Liver and Kidney yin, benefits the essence and brightens the eyes. Together, Ju Hua and Gou Qi Zi make a tasty tea that treats dizziness, eyestrain, improves vision, and soothes the eyes.<br />\nIn a cup, add hot water to about 5 grams of Ju Hua, and 5 grams of Gou Qi Zi. Cover and steep for five or more minutes. The tea is visually beautiful and tastes nice as well.</p>\n<p>I enjoy a mixture of camomile and chrysanthemum tea at night and this combination calms and relaxes the muscles I can recommend this as a pleasant nightcap!</p>\n<p>Alongside the Chrysanthamums piled up are the abundance of pumpkins waiting to be made into soup and pies.

The vegetable is one of the food items recommended by dieticians in cholesterol controlling and weight reduction programs.</p>\n<p>Pumpkin is a storehouse of many anti-oxidant vitamins such as vitamin-A, vitamin-C and vitamin-E.</p>\n<p>With 7384 mg per 100 g, it is one of the vegetables in the Cucurbitaceae family featuring highest levels of vitamin-A, providing about 246% of RDA. Vitamin A is a powerful natural anti-oxidant and is required by the body for maintaining the integrity of skin and mucus membranes. It is also an essential vitamin for good visual sight. Research studies suggest that natural foods rich in vitamin A help a body protects against lung and oral cavity cancers.</p>\n<p>It is an excellent source of many natural poly-phenolic flavonoid compounds such as \u03b1, \u00df carotenes, cryptoxanthin, lutein and zea-xanthin. Carotenes convert into vitamin A inside the body.</p>\n<p>Zea-xanthin is a natural anti-oxidant which has UV (ultra-violet) rays filtering actions in the macula lutea in retina of the eyes. helping to protect from &#8220;age-related macular disease&#8221; (ARMD) in the elderly.</p>\n<p>The fruit is a good source of B-complex group of vitamins like folates, niacin, vitamin B-6 (pyridoxine), thiamin and pantothenic acid.</p>\n<p>It is also rich source of minerals like copper, calcium, potassium and phosphorus.</p>\n<p>Pumpkin seeds indeed are an excellent source of dietary fiber and mono-unsaturated fatty acids, which are good for heart health. In addition, the seeds are concentrated sources of protein, minerals and health-benefiting vitamins. For instance, 100 g of pumpkin seeds provide 559 calories, 30 g of protein, 110% RDA of iron, 4987 mg of niacin (31% RDA), selenium (17% of RDA), zinc (71%) etc., but no cholesterol. Further, the seeds are an excellent source of health promoting amino acid tryptophan.

I always feel concerned when I read these articles as when a person develops an illness or medical problem and have to seek medical advise it creates an added anxiety as to whether they are going to receive good treatment or if they are going to be taken seriously.<br />\nThe number of complaints to the General Medical Council(GMC) \u2013 which oversees doctors practising medicine in the UK &#8211; increased by 23% from 7,153 in 2010 to 8,781 in 2011 &#8211; continuing a pattern which has been rising since 2007.<br />\nAbout two thirds of these complaints are from the general public the remainder are from other public bodies such as the police or coroner services and others healthcare professionals.</p>\n<p>However, although there is an increase in complaints it is important to put the figures into context. It is estimated that there are over 100 million patient-doctor interactions each year in the NHS. This <strong>\u2018complaint-rate\u2019 of less than 0.001% per interaction</strong> is something of which most industries would be envious.<br />\nAlso, as the GMC points out, the rise in complaints may not be due to worsening services, but could be the result of rising patient expectations and an increased willingness to complain.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, we would all like to think that there were no complaints and it is not helpful to hear these figures if you have a serious complaint to make but I thought this would be somewhat reassuring to those who may be having to face medical treatment in the near or distant future.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the commonest complaints?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>concerns with investigations and treatment, such as failure to diagnose or prescribing inappropriate medications</li>\n<li>problems with communication \u2013 such as not providing appropriate information or not responding to people\u2019s concerns</li>\n<li>perceived lack of respect for the patient \u2013 such as being rude or dishonest</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Many members of the general public are probably not aware that we are now appraised on an annual basis and every doctor since 2012 will have to go through a revalidation process every 5 years. The appraisal has to show that we are maintaining an up to date portfolio of attendances at educational meetings and literature we have read. We have to discuss how we communicate with our patients, our practise staff and medical colleagues and any complaints we have had and how we have addressed them as well as any accolades we have received. We have produce written proof that all these aspects are being addressed. </p>\n<p>In this practise, for more than 10 years we have had a range of medical students assigned to the practise and I am always grateful to patients who are prepared to see them. When they start I am very anxious that they simply get used to talking to all ages and different types of people and learn to extract information in a respectful but effective manner.<br />\n I took a group of students to see one of our rather garrulous patients who albeit had a fascinating medical history. One delightful student, a highly intellectual Oxford Graduate in philosophy, who had decided to change tack and study medicine was asked to take this lady&#8217;s history. He was amazingly patient and an excellent listener and I decided to not interrupt for about 20minutes. Then I asked him to finish and we thanked the patient and left. When we as a group analysed what information he had extracted it was evident that he had extracted the smoking history of every member of \u00a0her family going back two generations and what had happened to them but we weren&#8217;t quite sure whether she had ever smoked. We had established how long she had been living in the flat, the price and the prices over the years and who had lived there before including a lady who had put her head in the gas oven and that&#8217;s why there was an electric cooker but not much more despite her having numerous medical problems.</p>\n<p>I then said to him, &#8220;Suppose she then collapsed and you had to report to your senior colleague her main medical problems what would you say?&#8221; He then realised his gentle,caring listening manner had been his downfall.</p>\n<p>As a group we all learnt from this as to how to focus a patient to get the correct information. As a group we worked with that student who eventually was able to use his listening talent effectively but also extract the relevant information teaching us all important lessons in history taking.<br />\nI often ask patients to write down all their concerns in a list to be discussed. This is also useful when attending hospital appointments. </p>\n<p>Communication is a dialogue between two people and also involves interpretation of facts obtained. </p>\n<p>When I was in practise in Wales patients would frequently report having had a &#8220;pull&#8221; and this could mean absolutely anything from pain of any sort to collapsing and as it involved careful questioning as well as close observation of the patient&#8217;s body language and knowledge of something about them to find out what they meant. Moreover, I soon learnt never to ask what brought them to the doctor to avoid the ramifications of the mode of transport that was or may have been available of ask how they were because the reply could be anything and often not medical!</p>\n<p>We all know how difficult it can be to get anything but a grunt from a teenager and in one consultation I had to resort to asking a grunting 14year old boy to tell me what football team he supported and as he said &#8220;Chelsea&#8221; I flashed an Arsenal key ring in front of him and then words fell out of his mouth.</p>\n<p>I have to say that in some parts of the country for example the&#8217; Black Country&#8217; (West Midlands)&#8217; where some of my family come from it is impossible to understand what they are trying to say. As my mother would have said , &#8221; don&#8217;t they have a broad accent?&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Daily Mail were totally misguided when they implied that the communication problem was due to foreign doctors as figures do not support this and after all I was a GP in a Welsh speaking part of Wales!</p>\n<p>Surgeons can be particularly poor at communicating as they are &#8216;doers&#8217; and I have known brilliant surgeons who have weak communication skills. If I am aware a patient is going to have surgery or a procedure I often suggest that if they don&#8217;t get or understand the answers or explanations they need or want they can be seen by the GP to get this information. We can phone, email or write to or even meet the consultant face to face to get that information. They are more often than not charming and only too glad for us to liaise with them.</p>\n<p>When it comes to rudeness or lack of respect, in the same way patients should not be rude of disrespectful then there should be zero tolerance for a doctor to behave in this manner.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/image6.jpg\"><img src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/image6.jpg?w=150&#038;h=99\" alt=\"image\" width=\"150\" height=\"99\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1254\" /></a>The GMC lays out very clearly the duties expected of doctors and I have reproduced this from literature which is sent annually to every doctor registered with them:-</p>\n<p><strong>Duties of a Doctor</strong></p>\n<p>The duties of a doctor registered with the General Medical Council<br />\nPatients must be able to trust doctors with their lives and health.

It became worse after doing a sponsored walk along the coastline of Wales in aid of the Church of Wales Children&#8217;s Society. This illustrated how it can present with few symptoms.<br />\nHe was a man of great fortitude, intellect and humour and my memories are of laughter and fascinating intellectual discussions.</p>\n<p><strong>What is the prostate?</strong><br />\nMen have a small gland about the size of a walnut called the prostate <a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/image1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-1246\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/image1.jpg?w=270&#038;h=295\" width=\"270\" height=\"295\" /></a>gland. The prostate surrounds the first part of the tube (urethra) which carries urine from the bladder to the penis. The same tube also carries sex fluid (semen). The prostate gland is divided into 2 lobes, to the left and the right of a central groove.</p>\n<p>The prostate gland produces a thick clear fluid which is an important part of the semen. The growth and function of the prostate depends on the male sex hormone testosterone, which is produced in the testes. Some treatments for prostate cancer work by lowering the levels of testosterone.</p>\n<p><strong>Symptoms of non cancerous and cancerous prostate conditions</strong><br />\nAs men get older their prostate gland often enlarges. This is usually not due to cancer. It is a condition called benign prostatic hyperplasia.</p>\n<p>The symptoms of growths in the prostate are similar whether they are non cancerous (benign) or cancerous (malignant).<br />\nThe symptoms include:-</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Having to rush to the toilet to pass urine</li>\n<li>Difficulty passing urine</li>\n<li>Passing urine more often than usual, especially at night</li>\n<li>Pain when passing urine</li>\n<li>Blood in the urine or semen</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The last two symptoms \u2013 pain and bleeding \u2013 are very rare in prostate cancer. They are more often a symptom of non cancerous prostate conditions.</p>\n<p><strong>It is important to realise though, that very early prostate cancer generally does not cause any symptoms at all.</strong><br />\nIf a tumour is not large enough to put much pressure on the tube that carries urine out of the body (the urethra), you may not notice any effects from it.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/image2.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1247\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/image2.jpg?w=289&#038;h=300\" width=\"289\" height=\"300\" /></a><br />\n<strong>Other symptoms of prostate cancer</strong><br />\nCancer of the prostate gland often grows slowly, especially in older men. Symptoms may be mild and occur over many years. Sometimes the first symptoms are from prostate cancer cells which have spread to your bones but this is not common. Cancer cells in the bone may cause pain in your</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Back</li>\n<li>Hips</li>\n<li>Pelvis</li>\n<li>Other bony areas</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cancer that has spread to other areas of the body is called metastatic or secondary prostate cancer. In this section there is information about the treatment of prostate cancer that has spread.</p>\n<p>Other symptoms that may occur are weight loss, particularly in elderly men, and difficulty getting an erection (where you haven&#8217;t had difficulty before).</p>\n<p>We as GP&#8217;s have guidelines that tell them the symptoms to look out for, and when we should send you to a specialist for tests. The guidelines say that men who have symptoms that could be due to prostate cancer should be offered.<br />\n<strong>PSA testing</strong><br />\nPSA stands for prostate specific antigen. This is a substance made by normal and cancerous prostate cells and released into the bloodstream. The level of PSA in your blood may go up in prostate cancer because more PSA leaks into the bloodstream from the cancerous cells. PSA levels also go up as you get older and if you have a benign (non cancerous) enlarged prostate. So the PSA test is not a specific test for cancer. There is a range of normal PSA readings for every age group. The upper normal limit for a man aged 50 is around 3.0 ng/ml but this increases to 5.0 ng/ml if you are 70.<br />\nThis is not done aaa a routine screening test due to the non specificity of the test.</p>\n<p>If your PSA level is slightly raised (a borderline result), the guidelines say you should have another PSA test in 1 to 3 months time. The second test checks if the PSA is going up or is staying the same.</p>\n<p>If you have a suspicious PSA reading and other symptoms that could be related to prostate cancer, the guidelines say your GP should consider referring you to a specialist for an appointment within 2 weeks.</p>\n<p>Your GP may decide to delay doing a PSA test sometimes. There are a few situations that can affect the reading and make it less accurate \u2013 for example, if you have a urine infection. A test should be delayed for a month after you&#8217;ve had treatment for a urine infection.</p>\n<p><strong>Rectal examination</strong><br />\nYour GP puts a gloved finger into your back passage (rectum) to feel your prostate gland and check for abnormal signs, such as a lumpy, hard prostate.

It was a discrete article postulating that a rare cancer called Kaposi Sarcoma was more common amongst sexually active homosexuals. The reason we were discussing this was because a patient, who was homosexual had returned from the USA and had heard a rumour that there was an increased risk of his developing cancer. My partner was was wondering if he should share what he read with the patient or not. We decided that as the article was so small on balance it was probably not appropriate. In 1994 it was found to be caused by a virus and confirmed as an AIDS-defining illness.</p>\n<p>HIV/AIDS was formally identified in the 1981.<br />\nI came to London in 1982 and I was working as an Examining Medical Physician which involved home visits to disabled people to assess for Attendance Allowance and Mobility Allowance (benefits which preceded Disability Living Allowance). One day I visited a man in Chiswick and after waiting at the door for a while whilst he struggled to get to the door he greeted by saying &#8220;I hope you are not going to be like the last doctor and take flight without completing the examination&#8221;<br />\nHe then told me the tale of how an elderly doctor had visited and began the examination assuming the man had Parkinson&#8217;s Disease. The man interjected by telling the doctor that actually he was suffering from AIDS and the doctor promptly got up from his chair and hastily left the house. That was how people reacted at that time and believe or not 30 years some people still react in this way!<br />\nHowever, I shall always be grateful to this man as he gave me my first tutorial on this condition and the dreadful side effects of the anti-viral treatment at that time,as it was a<br />\n&#8216;new&#8217; disease the majority of doctors had very limited knowledge. He knew that his life would soon be coming to an end.</p>\n<p>It is comparatively recently that as doctors we have felt confident to suggest blood testing in the surgery. One such patient we carried out the test and it came back positive and it was necessary to break the news to him. Although, devastated he told us how much better it was to be given the news by the doctors he had known for some years rather than by an unfamiliar doctor and sent Dr Livingstone and myself some flowers. However. sadly this delightful young man died suddenly before we had chance to thank him.

She was an intelligent, keen student and read Biology at Cardiff and subsequently followed a teachers training course.<br />\nShe was a teacher at the same school and had to set up the Biology department from scratch finding the equipment and devising a curriculum. Despite her short stature she claims she never had discipline problems with her pupils. Her department became an important nurturing ground for future doctors and this was evident on her birthday when cards appeared from former pupils<br />\nShe had been brought up in Tenby,Pembrokeshire and was a keen pupil from infancy.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/image8.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1298\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/image8.jpg?w=300&#038;h=187\" width=\"300\" height=\"187\" /></a><br />\nShe recalled how as a 5 year old her GP performed an adenoidectomy on the kitchen table. She described how when the doctor arrived she remembers coming downstairs in her pyjamas and dressing gown, climbing up onto the table as instructed. She remembers a mask was given to her with presumably an anaesthetic and then felt herself drift into a sleep as if floating on a sea of blue. As she came around she observed the doctor tidying his instruments and as she opened her eyes she said, &#8220;Sorry am I awake too soon?&#8221; She made a nun eventful recovery.</p>\n<p>Several years later she clearly recalls how the family were in the garden watching Amelia Mary Earhart flying over on one of her solo flights. Amelia Earhart was the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean and setting many aviation records and disappeared in July 1937 and never found.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/image7.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1297\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/image7.jpg?w=300&#038;h=202\" width=\"300\" height=\"202\" /></a><br />\nFollowing this event her father developed a severe gastric haemorrhage and the doctor was called. He advised sucking ice on a daily basis for 2 weeks as a way of stopping the bleeding. Her father then went on to have major surgery but was confined to a &#8216;bath chair&#8217; ( wheelchair) for several years as the incision was slow to heal. He eventually went back to light work but was advised to stay on a light diet of milk, butter, mashed potato and chicken with occasional pork loin and calves foot jelly and large quantities of antacids.<br />\nThe family moved to Cardiff she claims &#8216;to have better medical treatment.&#8217; On one occasion her father was taken to hospital with abdominal pain from the a hernia in the old surgical scar and the junior doctor suggested surgery, which she questioned (an unusual reaction in those days). As a young woman she insisted on seeing the consultant who discussed the problem and agreed with her and surgery Ewan&#8217;s not performed and her father recovered. She has never stopped questioning the medical profession since that occasion and when I arrived she had plenty of questions and views to air about the present NHS as she has done on every occasion I have seen her. Her father lived until he was 86 years and despite her mother having breast cancer treated with a radical mastectomy lived until she was 76yrs. She has had severe osteoporosis and broken many bones including her right wrist on several occasions. She was one of the first patients to have a Bisphosphonate infusion and other new drugs for osteoporosis and is well known to the Rheumatology department at University Hospital of Wales and always ready to try new treatment as long as it is all the evidence is explained in full detail. She has remained reasonably mobile and proudly claimed that more recently she has been climbing the stairs on occasions instead of using the stairlift!<br />\nWhen we arrived on the Eve of her birthday she had prepared Afternoon tea with ham sandwiches and lemon drizzle cake and was busy doing the Telegraph crossword. The sitting room of her flat was full of cards including a card from the Queen and the Welsh Secretary of State and flowers many from old pupils. She was animated and very excited about her impending party. After supper which she instructed me how to prepare and serve followed later that evening and then insisting on viewing the 10 o&#8217;clock news to catch up on the latest International events.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/image9.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1299\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/image9.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a><br />\nNext morning she was up early as carers called to wash and dress her and there was incessant chat about local gossip and discussions about what she was going to wear and was her new jacket going to coordinate with her dress and shoes. She then sat at her desk to read her emails and send replies appropriately. Fortunately the Warden of the sheltered housing has been able to give her lessons when she bought her laptop a few years ago.</p>\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t long before the door bell rang and continued to ring at frequent intervals in between the phone ringing \u00a0with good wishes from people of all ages. As I was felt weary from the constant flow of well wishers she seemed to get more animated.</p>\n<p>She gave me instructions of what to prepare for lunch and then after this received more visitors. Later the hairdresser arrived to style her hair and another carer called in to dress her for the party that she had insisted must be in the evening.<br />\nShe was driven to a Country Club on the outskirts of Cardiff and joined by about 30 guests. Surveying the scene, she positively glowed throughout the meal, which she had carefully chosen and clearly enjoyed her choice with a glass of red wine. Finally, after a speech from her niece&#8217;s husband we raised our glasses of champagne to wish her &#8216;Happy Birthday&#8217; and then she walked with her 3 wheeled walking aid (she affectionately calls &#8216;My Merc&#8217;) to cut the cake and then gave a short speech to thank those who came and as she said to recommend reaching 100 years of age as it is &#8216;rather fun&#8217;!<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/image13.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1304\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/image13.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 1295, "location": false, "date": "12-14-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Fever", "Capillary refill return", "Glass test", "Health", "children's health", "Bronchiolitis"], "text": "<p>FEVERISH illness in children. &#8211; when to seek further advice.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/image16.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1313\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/image16.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\n<p>I shall always remember a cold, foggy autumn Sunday evening as a GP &gt; 30 years ago. I was sitting by the fire, reading a good book listening to my favourite album at the time &#8216;Black Magic Woman&#8217; and the phone rang as I was on call. It was a young, first time father who was a senior executive for Sony and he wanted advice as to what to give his 3 month old baby for a cough. He wondered if Benylin would be alright. No,he did not want me to come out on such a dreadful evening to their home which was in an out of the way village and not easy to find. The majority of the patients lived within 2 mile radius of the practise and I knew most of them well but this was a new family who lived the furthest distance away from the practise. The baby was sleeping well but had not been feeding so well but he shrugged that off as probably being due to the cough.<br />\nI thought to myself, &#8221; Did I really want to leave my warm, cosy cottage or leave the book when it was just getting to the crux of the plot and after all he wasn&#8217;t demanding that I ventured out .&#8221;<br />\nHowever, that gut feeling told me something was not right and I needed to set eyes on this baby and it must be sooner rather than later.<br />\nIt was a grim, pea-soup of an evening and I drove cautiously to the visit, following the father&#8217;s instructions to the letter and somehow managed to find the house with very little problem. The mother greeted me at the door wearing a face-mask and the father and extended family all came to the door similarly clad. I was then shown to the nursery through a house which was something out of &#8216;House Beautiful&#8217; no clutter, everything perfect, decor impeccable, carpets like walking on soft foam and a bijoux nursery. As I approached the cot I viewed the baby, ashen in colour, shallow rapid breathing and barely rousable. The family looked at me expectantly in silence. How could I tell this family that their baby was life-threatill as they seemed so unaware? I spoke firmly and gently telling them of my findings. The father&#8217;s reaction was simply, &#8220;Can we go privately?&#8221;</p>\n<p>At that time in Wales that was not an option and even getting an ambulance to take them to the local hospital was not quick and easy.</p>\n<p>Shortly we came to a compromise that I would take the baby and mother in my Ford Popular to the nearest hospital nearly 20 miles away followed by the father in his Mercedes.<br />\nWe arrived at the Hospital having prewarned them of the arrival and the baby was admitted with a diagnosis of bronchiolitis with heart failure. when I had worked as a junior paediatric doctor I had worked under the watchful eye of Sister Williams, who was always a force to be reckoned with despite being not much bigger than most of the paediatric patients. \u00a0I greeted her like a lost friend and she immediately took charge and when the parents saw our relationship it was clear that they were instantly reassured their precious child would be in good hands under the NHS.<br />\nThe baby thankfully made a full recovery but what remains indelible in my mind are several aspects of this case:-</p>\n<ul>\n<li>my momentary hesitation to visit,</li>\n<li>the parents not wanting to appear over anxious,</li>\n<li>these caring parents who were unable to understand the severity of their baby&#8217;s illness</li>\n<li>there anxiety about their local hospital.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These factors still apply today but a combination such as this could have result in a tradegy.</p>\n<p>A retrospective study recently carried out looked at children admitted to hospital with serious respiratory tract infections. The parents of these children were sent questionnaires after the admission and, from their replies, the authors identified factors which may have delayed earlier medical intervention and one of the reasons included &#8216;Problems assessing the severity of the illness&#8217; and my other observations aswell as:-</p>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The belief that their child would not be prescribed antibiotics or would be prescribed antibiotics too readily</li>\n<li>The belief that their concerns would not be taken seriously</li>\n<li>Feeling powerless to challenge clinical authority.</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p>Organisational factors:</p>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Perceived problems accessing healthcare services</li>\n<li>Inadequate primary care triage</li>\n<li>Barriers to accessing timely consultations</li>\n<li>Past experience of problems accessing healthcare, leading to failure to consult</li>\n<li>Perceived poor quality clinical encounter</li>\n<li>Inadequate assessment and communication</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p>It is for this reason I felt it was important to write this blog.</p>\n<p><strong>If you have any concerns about your child&#8217;s medical condition bring the child to the surgery and if the child is &lt; 5years or an older child which has significant concerns they will be seen as soon as possible.\u00a0</strong><strong>If it is Out of Hours call 111 in order that your child can be seen as soon as possible at the nearest Urgent Care Centre (UCC).</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong></strong><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/image55.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-888\" alt=\"Red flag\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/image55.jpg?w=150&#038;h=150\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>The following symptoms should always be treated as serious:\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li>a high-pitched, weak or continuous cry</li>\n<li>a lack of responsiveness, reduction in activity or increased floppiness</li>\n<li>in babies, a bulging fontanelle (the soft spot on a baby&#8217;s head)</li>\n<li>neck stiffness (in a child)</li>\n<li>not drinking for more than eight hours (taking solid food is not as important)</li>\n<li>a temperature of over 38\u00b0C for a baby less than three months old, or over 39\u00b0C for a baby aged three to six months old</li>\n<li>a high temperature, but cold feet and hands</li>\n<li>a high temperature coupled with quietness and listlessness<br />\nfits, convulsions or seizures</li>\n<li>turning blue, very pale, mottled or ashen</li>\n<li>difficulty breathing, fast breathing, grunting while breathing, or if your child is working hard to breathe, for example, sucking their stomach in under their ribs</li>\n<li>your baby or child is unusually drowsy, hard to wake up or doesn\u2019t seem to know you</li>\n<li>your child is unable to stay awake even when you wake them</li>\n<li>a spotty, purple-red rash anywhere on the body (this could be a sign of meningitis)</li>\n<li>repeated vomiting or bile-stained (green) vomiting</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p><strong> It can be difficult to know when to call an ambulance or go to phone 111 seek a doctors advise as to where you should go.

The average normal body temperature taken in the mouth is 37\u00b0C but anywhere between 36.5\u00b0C and 37.2\u00b0C is deemed as normal. When temperatures are measured in the axilla they can be 0.2\u00b0C to 0.3\u00b0C lower than this. Aural (tympanic) thermometers may measure the temperature as higher.</p>\n<p>Fever is one of the most common reasons for a child to be taken to see a doctor and is the second most common reason for a child to be admitted to hospital.</p>\n<p>The cause of the fever can sometimes be hard to elicit and this can be a worry for healthcare professionals. It is usually due to a viral infection that is self-limiting but it can also be a sign of serious bacterial infection, including meningitis. Early diagnosis of serious infections in general practice is difficult as incidence is low, the child may present early in the disease process and diagnostic tools are more or less limited to history and examination.</p>\n<p>When a child presents with a fever it is important for the health care professional to take an adequate history and for the parent or guardian to provide accurate information</p>\n<p><strong>History should include asking:</strong></li>\n<li>How long has the fever been present?</li>\n<li>Has the parent/carer been measuring temperature and, if so, by what method?</li>\n<li>Is there a rash?

They are enjoyed as a starter for the Christmas meal with a glass of Champagne.</p>\n<p>My personal introduction to oysters was when I was in my late teens when I was hiking through Northern France with a group of English and French students. We had met in the West coast of Ireland the year before in an International camp and it was evident at that time that the French boys were skilled at collecting shellfish and knew how to serve them. When we met them in France we camped in the grounds of various farms and were introduced to the delicacies of local delicious French soft cheeses,Cr\u00eapes aswell as cider and Calvados. The <a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/image40.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-1364\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/image40.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a>last visit was to the home of Alain who was about to join the French Navy for his National service. He happily took us out in his boat and after a coastal trip then moored in a small cove and told us wanted to give us a surprise. The next thing this swarthy French young man dived off the boat armed with a knife. He soon returned with a bag of oysters he had harvested deftly from the rock something he had being doing for several years. He then prepared them by prising open their shell and demonstrating swallowing them whole . Under the circumstances I found no difficulty in acquiring the taste instantly. I have to say at that time I was not aware they are considered to have Aphrodisiac properties!<br />\nLike so many foods, oysters are an acquired taste. The thought of eating them raw remains deeply repellent to some, though if you enjoy other seafood there should be little difficulty in getting to grips with them. While Jonathan Swift once remarked that &#8220;he was a bold man that first ate an oyster&#8221;, the slithery beauty of a fresh oyster is a unique taste most definitely worth acquiring! Many discover a lifelong enthusiasm and will choose oysters in preference to any other item on a restaurant menu. I include myself in that category.<br />\nHence, since 1989 when I have been frequently visiting France I have very rarely missed having oysters for Christmas and with a glass of Champagne.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/image41.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1365\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/image41.jpg?w=250&#038;h=194\" width=\"250\" height=\"194\" /></a><br />\nWhen I drink a glass of champagne I always think of miners trapped underground, when I worked in a Welsh Mining valley I was told on good account that on occasions when miners were trapped a tube was introduced into the cavity where they were stranded and champagne was delivered as those above ground believed it was good nourishment. Interestingly, in April 2007, the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry published the results of a recent joint study by the University of Reading and University of Cagliari that showed moderate consumptions of Champagne may help the brain cope with the trauma of stroke, Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, and Parkinson&#8217;s disease.</p>\n<p>Oysters do have health benefits. Don&#8217;t worry if you chip some of the shell when preparing the oysters as the shell is a Chinese Herb known Mu Li is also named Concha Ostreae, \u7261\u86ceConcha Ostreae) and is used to treat menopausal symptoms and &#8220;calms the spirit&#8221;, treating anxiety.<br />\nThe oysters themselves as well as being rich in protein, they are also low in fat and in calories. They contain significant amounts of zinc, calcium, iron, iodine, copper, magnesium and selenium. Legendary properties have also been attributed: it is believed by some that oysters are the Viagra of the sea. A team of American and Italian researchers analyzed bivalves and found they were rich in amino acids that trigger increased levels of sex hormones.

The Liver in TCM has very different functions than the liver in western medicine. In western medicine, some of the functions are to produce certain proteins for blood plasma, regulate blood clotting and resist infections by producing immune factors and removing bacteria from the blood stream. In Chinese medicine, the liver has 6 main functions and they are as follows:<br />\n\u2022 Regulate Qi (energy)<br />\n\u2022 Open in eyes<br />\n\u2022 Stores blood<br />\n\u2022 Controls tendons and sinews<br />\n\u2022 Manifests in nails<br />\n\u2022 Houses ethereal soul<br />\nThis prime aspect of the liver can have great affect on three aspects of the body: the emotions, digestion, and the free flow of blood.<br />\n<strong>1) Strongly effects emotions</strong><br />\nIf Liver function is normal, people will have smooth flowing emotional states favoring happiness. If the flow of Qi is stagnated or stuck, they will experience frustration, depression, irritability or anger. Various pre-menstrual syndrome symptoms will also arise such as irregular or painful periods, mood swings and breast tenderness.<br />\nThe Liver is the organ system most affected by suppressed emotions. Therefore not dealing with your triggers and emotions for a long time can lead to \u201cLiver Qi Stagnation\u201d and eventually pathologies of other body organs.<br />\n2) <strong>Affects the digestion of food</strong><br />\nIf the Qi is not flowing smoothly (i.e. from emotions), the digestion system will have trouble performing their functions. If the Liver Qi is stagnated it can affect the Stomach causing nausea, vomiting and belching. It can also affect the Spleen and cause diarrhea.<br />\n3) <strong>Blood Flow</strong><br />\nThe relationship between blood and qi (energy) is very close and they always move together. The blood cannot go where the qi does not. If the free flow of the qi is stagnated by the liver, the blood will stagnate as well. The stagnation of liver qi will still cause stagnation of blood, which will lead to the gynecological symptoms.<br />\nI remember a patient coming to the surgery with very sore eyes which she was causing her great distress. On examination there was no obvious problem and as a Western doctor I could offer no treatment. I decided to take a TCM history and as her eyes were the problem I focused on symptoms and examination accordingly. When I asked her about her menstruation she claimed she was late but definitely not pregnant, she had no appetite and had a dull ache in her upper abdomen and chest. Then I asked her about her emotions and she changed from a softly spoken, refined young women and started to cry and become very angry. Eventually she related the story of how she worked in a small boutique and there had been a robbery and she had been held a gunpoint and although she was not hurt she was extremely angry that her boss was not installing a panic alarm and safety catch on the door.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/image14.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1420\" alt=\"Tongue\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/image14.jpg?w=99&#038;h=150\" width=\"99\" height=\"150\" /></a>I examined her tongue and pulse (important features of a TCM examination) and diagnosed Liver Qi stagnation with fire due to the symptoms she presented and her red tip and sides of tongue as well as a wiry pulse.<br />\nThe treatment for her eyes was to deal with her anger by getting her work situation sorted out as this from a TCM perspective was causing her medical problems.</p>\n<p>If you imagine someone having over indulged alcohol with their red eyes, emotionally labile, irritability, altered appetite and aching joints, staggering gait and poor sexual function &#8211; TCM will account for these features.</p>\n<p><strong>Liver disease is the fifth biggest &#8211; and fastest-growing &#8211; killer in the UK but a lack of obvious symptoms means it can be diagnosed at a late stage.<br />\nIt works hard and can take a lot of abuse, but it is like an elastic band \u2013 it can only stretch so far before it breaks.</strong></p>\n<p><strong><br />\nThere are 3 main threats to the Liver</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Alcohol</li>\n<li>Fatty diet</li>\n<li>viral Hepatitis</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>ALCOHOL</strong></p>\n<p>Andrew Langford, chief executive of the British Liver Trust, said: \u201cOverindulging in fatty food too frequently, having an alcoholic drink every night and not making time for regular exercise are major contributing factors for liver disease.</p>\n<p>\u201cTo repair the liver and keep it healthy, people need to take at least two to three <a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/image10.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1414\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/image10.jpg?w=150&#038;h=134\" width=\"150\" height=\"134\" /></a>consecutive days off alcohol every week, and drink within the recommended limits at other times, affecting a permanent lifestyle change.\u201d<br />\n<strong>Only you know yourself if you can limit your drinking and it well established that some people are unable to do and need to abstain completely.</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/image9.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1413\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/image9.jpg?w=150&#038;h=150\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><br />\nA long established organisation who can help called Alcoholics Anonymous is a group of men and women who share their experience, strength and hope with each other that they may solve their common problem and help others to recover from alcoholism.</p>\n<p>The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop drinking.

The common ones are hepatitis A, B and C. Most people recover from hepatitis A with no lasting liver damage, but hepatitis B and C can cause long term liver disease and even liver cancer.</p>\n<p>Hepatitis A is passed out in the bowel motions of an infected person, and is passed from person to person by eating food or drinking water contaminated with the virus due to poor hygiene standards . Most people feel better within a few weeks. The illness can be more severe in those who are old or who have other underlying conditions.<br />\nHow to look after your liver.<br />\nThere are vaccines available to protect against hepatitis A. Vaccination is recommended if you are travelling abroad outside Europe and the US, but you should also speak to your GP if you think you might be at risk because of your job or your lifestyle.</p>\n<p>Both hepatitis B and C are easy to catch through blood to blood contact and very hard to get rid of. Even a tiny amount of dried blood \u2013 too small to be visible to the naked eye \u2013 is enough to pass on the infection if it gets into your blood stream.</p>\n<p>This could be from sharing contaminated:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>equipment for injecting drugs (including steroids)</li>\n<li>tattoo, accupuncture or body piercing equipment</li>\n<li>medical or dental equipment</li>\n<li>razors, clippers, or toothbrushes</li>\n<li>through an open cut or wound.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sex and passing the virus from mother to baby at birth, are also high risk factors for hepatitis B.</p>\n<p>There are few symptoms of hepatitis B and C and people can be infected for many years without knowing, during which time liver damage can occur.

As you become older you realise that you have to stand back and let younger colleagues move forward.<br />\nWe all have a place in this world and we all perform a function, regardless of our ability or disability. The word order of this sentence may make it more difficult to understand. In modern English it would be something like: &#8220;They (those people) who only stand and wait, also serve.&#8221;<br />\nJohn Milton wrote this sonnet more than 350 years ago after he had gone completely blind. He was inferring that despite someone having any disability they always have a purpose in life.</p>\n<p>There have been many occasions in my life when I have had to wait but if I reflect on these times they have often been shown to be valuable. When I was in Nigeria and was travelling by bus across the country to Zaria to the Hospital, where I was going to be working for an elective. Suddenly,en route in what seemed the back of beyond the bus broke down and careered off the road. Out of nowhere appeared mnumerous able-bodied men, who literally lifted the bus back on to the road, but still the bus failed to start. We waited nearly 2 days for help to arrive. I had felt waiting 30 minutes for a bus to arrive was long enough but 2 days seemed unimaginable. During that time villagers appeared selling food and many other items some of use others were just souvenirs. This was probably my first lesson in waiting and I learnt very quickly how people lived in Nigeria. Now when I see those people in Sudan or Syria on the TV waiting for food parcels it brings back my memory of having to just wait until help arrived and that feeling of being powerless to hasten the process. I only had to wait 2 days and I was not that hungry. </p>\n<p>Since that time there have been numerous occasions of waiting.<br />\nAs a doctor we often have to wait: for medication to take effect, a woman to deliver, a person to die, a patient to arrive after accepting an admission and simply to wait at the end of a phone for the right person to answer. Over the years during these waiting times I have learnt to play bridge and other card games, play darts and snooker. I have had chance to read most daily papers, many novels and of course learnt about many medical conditions as well as learn about the lives of fellow doctors, nurses, cleaners and porters. It was often a time to think about what I was doing and why and reflect.  I realise that these waiting times have been invaluable in teaching me more about being patient, being aware of those around me and the lives they live and the importance of their roles as well as learning to do things I would never have dreamt of doing.<br />\nSadly, today working is about being cost effective and if someone is simply waiting it is considered to be inefficient so that we all have to be active and productive.<br />\nIn my partial retirement I am learning to stop and reflect once again and as I write up my latest appraisal at the end of each clause I am instructed to reflect. We are now being advised to have protected time on a regular basis to reflect on our work, probably not to play darts or bridge but to have time out to look at what we are doing well or not so well.<br />\nThose words written 350 years ago sound much more meaningful in that waiting may become part of life and can be a very important aspect if you allow it to be. Moreover, if that is all you can do so be it. </p>\n", "post_id": 1399, "location": false, "date": "01-14-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["stress", "Pilates", "yoga", "Back pain", "back exercises", "Health", "Ealing", "health benefits"], "text": "<p>Back pain can impact on many things we want to do on a daily basis.

Working conditions were hard and there was little attention paid to prevent chronic back problems. We only had limited ways of investigating and simply relied on our clinical skills to diagnose a problem and tended to air on the side of caution as we were unaware of what was occurring in the body . After years of carrying out sophisticated CT scans and MRI scans and following up patients we now realise we were being over cautious and pain did not necessarily mean serious damage and most cases of back pain could be treated by encouraging movement and over the counter painkillers. Physiotherapy and other treatments were not widely available and at that time the advise was bed-rest in every case! Many patients took to their beds for many weeks and as a consequence became long term invalids often never to work again. We now know that this bad advise and that 60% of acute back pain will have resolve after 2 weeks and most will resolve in 12 weeks. Also, by having regular exercise a recurrence can be prevented as well as advising manual workers at their place of employment how to lift and to encourage the use of equipment to assist lifting to avoid unnecessary trauma.</p>\n<p>During the second half of my career the patients who I see with back pain are sedentary workers who develop it as a result of prolonged sitting.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/image17.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1428\" alt=\"Back pain\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/image17.jpg?w=300&#038;h=195\" width=\"300\" height=\"195\" /></a><br />\nIt is actually more about how the body has to adapt to all the sitting, standing, and lifting than the activity itself.<br />\nMusculoskeletal problems today affect more women than in men for all age groups. For both genders, prevalence is noted higher in the 75 years and above age group. Nationally evidence suggests that MSK pain prevalence is higher in ethnic groups 63%-89% than White subjects (53%) at 45-64 age groups. 11.2 million working days per year are lost through MSK problems. Patients with MSK conditions account for the second largest group of patients in receipt of incapacity benefits after mental health. Back pain occurs in 4 out of 5 people at some time in their life.</p>\n<p>In Ealing this accounts for 16% of incapacity claims, which is higher than the London average (15%). Increasing longevity, obesity and lack of weight bearing exercise will increase the number of patients with MSK conditions. The Chartered Society of Physiotherapy found that nationally 36 per cent of employees worked through their lunch break and 31 per cent experienced pain at work at least once a week. The economic and personal costs could be greatly reduced by encouraging better working habits and recommending appropriate exercises and providing early access to services, such as physiotherapy, for people who develop ongoing musculoskeletal conditions.</p>\n<p>Because of the amount of time spent sitting, the body must gradually adapt itself to that position. This happens in a number of ways. The first thing it must adapt to is how the weight goes through the hips and pelvis. Then, there is the sitting position &#8211; upright, slouching, or something in-between.<br />\nThis position could be termed the Office Worker&#8217;s Slump. In the Office Worker&#8217;s Slump, the back curves forward, which means the abdominals are not engaged, while the lower back muscles (erector spinae) are constantly shortened. The result is stress on the lumber vertebrae and subsequent intervertebral discs.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/image34.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1612\" alt=\"Back -sitting\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/image34.jpg?w=300&#038;h=230\" width=\"300\" height=\"230\" /></a><br />\nThe Office Worker&#8217;s Slump puts the spine under unnecessary daily stress, and throws its surrounding supportive muscles into a state of imbalance. These muscles help prevent injury to the back; harm their effectiveness, and there is an increase risk of suffering back problems.<br />\nThen people with already susceptible backs attend training sessions at the gym and put their backs under undue strain. Simply moving heavy equipment around can cause damage &#8211; and that&#8217;s before making a start on those heavy weight bearing moves.<br />\nThe results vary from mild to crippling back pain &#8211; but both can be easily avoided. It is therefore important to follow gym work in the correct fashion and far from amplifying back issues, it can help to lower the risk of spinal injury.</p>\n<p><strong>Back pain is not generally caused by a serious condition</strong> but if not treated promptly by exercise and painkillers a pain cycle can easily evolve.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/image44.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1622\" alt=\"Pain cycle\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/image44.jpg?w=300&#038;h=291\" width=\"300\" height=\"291\" /></a></p>\n<p>The back is a complex structure made up of bones, muscles, nerves and joints.

In most cases, the pain gets better within 2 weeks and completely recovers in 4-6 weeks. As stated earlier it can usually be successfully treated by taking over the counter painkillers, keeping mobile and carrying out suggested back exercises for at least 6-8 weeks after recovery to prevent a relapse.<br />\nBack pain can be triggered by everyday activities at home or at work, or it can develop gradually over time as a result of prolonged sitting or standing or lifting badly.

As the particles have the same electrostatic charge (Zeta potential), they repel each other and this keeps them in uniform suspension throughout the medium. This is why it is called a colloid. It is not a medicine, it is an antimicrobial mineral solution.From research, Colloidal silver seems to have natural antibiotic properties against biological one cell germs AND viruses. It helps to boost the immune system and acts as a second defence against infections.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/image21.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1441\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/image21.jpg?w=150&#038;h=147\" width=\"150\" height=\"147\" /></a>Moreover, wound dressings which go under the name of Ag aquacel are used widely by nurses as they are excellent for healing severely infected leg ulcers, burns or wounds.<br />\nSilver has long been appreciated by the medical community. Hippocrates, \u201cthe father of medicine,\u201d knew of its healing and anti-disease properties. In World War I, before the advent of antibiotics, it was an important weapon against disease on the battlefield.</p>\n<p>More recently, the FDA approved a breathing tube with a fine coating of silver, after it was established that it reduced the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia. And that\u2019s just one example of the many roles silver plays in medicine today. It is also added to bandages and wound-dressings containing silver sulfadiazine or silver nanomaterials which treat external infections. It is used to line catheters it is effective in reducing catheter-related urinary tract infections as well as other medical instruments and is a key part of the technology behind X-rays.<br />\nThe silver ion (Ag+<span style=\"line-height:1.5;\">) is bioactive and in sufficient concentration readily kills bacteria in vitro. Silver and silver nanoparticles are used as an antimicrobial in a variety of industrial, healthcare and domestic applications.</span></p>\n<p>In 2007 M&amp;S started selling Silver-lined pyjamas, which are designed with thin silver <a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/image22.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-1442\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/image22.jpg?w=150&#038;h=100\" width=\"150\" height=\"100\" /></a>threads running through the material: the nightwear is worn to help prevent the spread of MRSA.

Although there are other factors why the upper classes lived longer such as the ate well, had better sanitation, kept warm and as a result, the will to live!<br />\nChurches use silver chalices to prevent transmission of infection when taking communion.

The &#8220;Not so fortunate&#8221; drank and ate from pewter which because of the high lead content, would often cause poisoning.</p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height:1.5;\">HOW DOES SILVER WORK?</span></p>\n<p>In metallic (elemental) form, silver is unreactive and cannot kill bacteria. To become bactericidal, silver atoms (denoted as Ag or Ag0) must lose an electron and become positively charged silver ions (Ag+). Elemental silver ionises in air, but ionises more readily when exposed to an aqueous environment such as wound exudate. In contrast, silver compounds contain positive silver ions bound to negatively charged ions or molecules. When exposed to aqueous environments, some of the silver ions become detached from the compound.<br />\nSilver ions are highly reactive and affect multiple sites within bacterial cells, ultimately causing bacterial cell death. They bind to bacterial cell membranes, causing disruption of the bacterial cell wall and cell leakage. Silver ions transported into the cell disrupt cell function by binding to proteins and interfering with energy production, enzyme function and cell replication.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/image25.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1445\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/image25.jpg?w=300&#038;h=279\" width=\"300\" height=\"279\" /></a>\u00a0Silver ions are active against a broad range of bacteria, fungi and virusesincluding many antibiotic- resistant bacteria, such as meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin- resistant Enterococci (VRE).<br />\nStudies of the effects of silver dressings on experimental models of biofilms \u00a0have suggested that silver may reduce bacterial adhesion and destabilise the biofilm matrix, as well as kill bacteria within the matrix and increase susceptibility of bacteria to antibiotic.</p>\n<p>Other effects of silver<br />\nSome laboratory studies have suggested that silver may have beneficial effects on wound healing other than the control of bioburden alone. For example, silver nitrate, nanocrystalline silver, and some silver-containing dressings have been found to have anti-inflammatory effects and to encourage blood vessel formation (neovascularisation). The clinical relevance of these findings is not yet known.<br />\nWHAT HAPPENS TO SILVER?<br />\nOnly a small proportion of silver presented to a wound site in a dressing is involved in antimicrobial action. Most of the rest remains within the dressing or binds to proteins in the wound or wound debris. Very little is systemically absorbed and even if it is absorbed systemically, silver is excreted mainly via the biliary route in the faeces and some is excreted in urine. \u00a0Silver is not absorbed into the central or peripheral nervous systems.</p>\n<p>Ancient civilizations reportedly used silver because they recognized a connection between the metal and their health. Today, people are also finding silver to be increasingly useful in health-related applications.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/image26.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1446\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/image26.jpg?w=300&#038;h=254\" width=\"300\" height=\"254\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 1432, "location": false, "date": "01-12-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["gout", "Health"], "text": "<p>This week it was reported that the prevalence of gout &#8211; traditionally associated with too much port and an unhealthy lifestyle &#8211; is soaring in the UK, according to a study.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/image35.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1478\" alt=\"Gout\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/image35.jpg?w=300&#038;h=233\" width=\"300\" height=\"233\" /></a></p>\n<p>Gout is a type of arthritis where swelling and severe pain which can develop in any joint, <a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/image40.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1484\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/image40.jpg?w=150&#038;h=84\" width=\"150\" height=\"84\" /></a>especially at the base of the big toe.

Most urate is produced <a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/image39.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-1482\" alt=\"Gout\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/image39.jpg?w=204&#038;h=300\" width=\"204\" height=\"300\" /></a>by the body. It breaks down substances known as purines and usually passes out in our urine.</p>\n<p>If urate does not pass out of the body, or if you produce too much, it can build up and form crystals. Gout is caused when these crystals build up and form around the body\u2019s joints, causing inflammation and pain.</p>\n<p>Urate builds up either because too much urate is being produced by the body or because not enough is being passed out in urine (which may indicate kidney disease). Some other diseases can also increase your likelihood of developing gout, including heart disease, psoriasis and the treatment of some blood disorders such as leukaemia.</p>\n<p>Not everyone with high urate levels will develop gout. We do not know why some people develop it. However, if you are overweight you are more likely to develop it. A good diet and weight loss will reduce your chances of developing gout.</p>\n<p>According to the latest research genes may play a part in increasing your risk of developing gout.</p>\n<p>You are at risk of developing gout</p>\n<ul>\n<li>if you are very stressed or have had an illness</li>\n<li>if you injure or bruise a joint. If you are prone to gout, and you have more pain in a joint than you would expect after a minor bump, it could be an attack coming on, so get treatment straight away</li>\n<li>by taking diuretics (water tablets) or low-dose aspirin. Some people take these for high blood pressure or to prevent heart disease<br />\ndehydration</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>How to help yourself during an attack of gout</strong></p>\n<p>An ice-pack (or pack of frozen peas), wrapped in a cloth, can be put on the sore joint for 30 minutes, several times a day, to bring relief and reduce inflammation.<br />\nA frame over your foot to keep bedclothes off it can relieve pain at night.<br />\nHow to manage the effects on your life</p>\n<p>If you are overweight, losing weight very gradually can help reduce the amount of urate in your blood. Do not go on a starvation diet. That can make gout worse.</p>\n<p>Moderate exercise is very important for keeping your joints moving. A physiotherapist can give you exercises that are right for you.</p>\n<p>Reduce the amount of alcohol you drink as dehydration can trigger gout. Alcohol, especially beer, can make it more likely for gout to flare up.</p>\n<p>Drink lots of water \u2013 between 1.5 and 2.5 litres a day (six to eight glasses) to help prevent kidney stones. This can stop urate forming into crystals. Drinking five or more cups of coffee daily has been shown to increase the amount of uric acid that is excreted.

A surprising diagnosis as she was slim, a non smoker and young but nevertheless the presenting symptoms raised the alarm bells.</p>\n<p>Likewise, when Dai 56 yrs came to the surgery with the story of increasing heaviness in the chest with breathlessness a week ago after rolling a barrel of beer up to &#8216;the Club&#8217; as the Brewery lorry had broken down on the hill. He was revived with a glass of brandy but an ECG later demonstrated that he had suffered a heart attack.</p>\n<p>In the same way, Bill who was a 60 yrs old bo&#8217;sun on a sailing ship and described severe indigestion when at sea, worse on exercise and again on investigation shown to have had a heart attack and subsequently had a quadruple bypass and in due course went back to sea.<br />\nIn all these cases the patient had that feeling that their pain was different and overwhelmed with anxiety and fear that it may be cardiac.</p>\n<p>Even if the pain is not assumed to be cardiac pain initially if other risk factors are taken into account such as in the case of Mrs.Patel, a 65yr old diabetic who had developed some vague chest pain on exercise and was worried, on further investigation was found to have had a &#8216;silent&#8217; heart attack and subsequently followed up by a triple bypass.</p>\n<p>As a medical student we are also told of the unpredictability of the heart and my first tutorial with a cardiologist was that of his examining a patient, reassuring them that there heart was in good order and the patient dying at the bus stop with a heart attack. Most of us are aware of this by hearing of a friend, relative or celebrity dying in the same way, but for the most part there is adequate warning.</p>\n<p>All these stories remind us that coronary artery disease is out there and can strike at anytime in many different forms and often the chest pain is not the main feature and can be in different parts of the upper body.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/image51.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1635\" alt=\"Heart attack\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/image51.jpg?w=285&#038;h=300\"   /></a></p>\n<p>It is for this reasons that doctors have joined together to formulate a scoring system of chest which is based on signs and symptoms which are relatively easy to recognise and can dictate how urgently action should be taken. In all the examples of the above patients presenting with chest pain each person would have scored at least 3 points.</p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0Components of the Marburg Heart Score</strong><br />\nScore component Assigned points</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Age/gender (female \u2265 65, male \u2265 55). 1</li>\n<li>Known clinical vascular disease 1</li>\n<li>Patient assumes cardiac origin of pain 1</li>\n<li>Pain worse with exercise. 1</li>\n<li>Pain not reproducible by palpation. 1</li>\n</ul>\n<p>1 point is assigned for each score variable. 3 different risk categories are derived:<br />\nlow risk = 0\u20132 points; intermediate risk = 3 points; high risk 4\u20135 points.</p>\n<p><strong>If you or someone with you scores &gt;3 points and you strongly suspect they are having a heart attack it is important to act immediately:-</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Dial 999 and ask for an ambulance if you suspect that you or someone you know is having a heart attack.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>If the casualty is not allergic to aspirin and it\u2019s easily available, give them a tablet (ideally 300mg) to slowly chew and then swallow while waiting for the ambulance to arrive</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p>The aspirin will help to thin the blood and restore blood supply to the heart.In my early career this life threatening pain could only be treated with very strong painkillers such as diamorphine commonly known as heroin (an important component of my doctors bag at the beginning of my career) and bed-rest and watchful waiting preferably at home.Now for treating Heart attacks there are two main treatment options for people with the most serious form of heart attack; an ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a combination of medication to dissolve the blood clot and restore the flow of blood to the heart (this is known as thrombolysis)</li>\n<li>surgery to widen the coronary artery, which is usually done using a technique called coronary angioplasty.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To read more about heart attack:-<br />\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/heart-attack/Pages/Introduction.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/heart-attack/Pages/Introduction.aspx</a></strong></p>\n", "post_id": 1436, "location": false, "date": "02-15-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Health", "Cystic Fibrosis", "London Marathon"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/image27.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1463\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/image27.jpg?w=300&#038;h=135\" width=\"300\" height=\"135\" /></a>Recently a patient attended surgery for a health check as she was anticipating taking part in the London Marathon.

As doctors we appreciate people raising money to research these life threatening illnesses and in this particular illness we have been aware of the significant progress that has been made and we wish Ali and Adam good luck in their venture.</p>\n<p><strong> The Cystic Fibrosis Trust</strong> was set up in 1964 making this year it&#8217;s 50th year!<br />\n<strong><a href=\"https://www.cysticfibrosis.org.uk\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.cysticfibrosis.org.uk</a></strong></p>\n<p>Interestingly, both Dr. Livingston and myself always give a tiny lick when we see a newborn baby for their first health check. The reason being that an early sign of Cystic Fibrosis is that an affected child\u2019s sweat is unusually salty, which can be noticeable when you kiss your child.</p>\n<p>We were both paediatric junior doctors in South Wales and aware that in that region Cystic Fibrosis was not<br />\n<span style=\"line-height:1.5;\">unusual. These small children were frequently admitted to hospital and at that time the majority died before they started school. They were diagnosed soon after birth and the parents had to work tirelessly to perform daily frequent postural drainage(chest physiotherapy) prepare a special diet and to accept the inevitable frequent hospital appointments and often long hospital admissions. It is not surprising that we knew these children well and not only admired these youngsters for their courage but also had great respect for the persistent hard work as well as the love and devotion these parents gave.</span></p>\n<p>Cystic fibrosis (also known as CF or mucoviscidosis) is a common hereditary disease. The name cystic fibrosis refers to the characteristic scarring (fibrosis) and cyst formation within the pancreas. CF is an inherited condition that affects many body functions such as breathing, digestion and reproduction. The lifelong condition becomes more severe with age and the majority have respiratory and digestive problems.<br />\nCF is one of the most common life-shortening diseases in Europe and the USA. Difficulty breathing is the most serious symptom and results from frequent lung infections that are treated, though not cured, by antibiotics and other medications.<br />\nCF is a life-shortening inherited disease, affecting over 10,000 people in the UK. One in twenty-two people of Mediterranean descent are carriers of one gene for CF, making it the most common genetic disease in these populations. Ireland not only has the highest incidence of cystic fibrosis in the world, but also the largest proportion of families with more than one child suffering from the condition.It also has the highest rate of CF carriers in the world; 1 in 19.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/image29.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1465\" alt=\"CF genetics\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/image29.jpg?w=295&#038;h=218\" width=\"295\" height=\"218\" /></a></p>\n<p>A person carries two copies of the gene associated with Cystic Fibrosis. If one of these genes is defective then this makes the person a carrier. For a child to have the possibility of inheriting the disease, a defective CF gene must be present in both parents. A child born to two carriers of the gene will not automatically inherit Cystic Fibrosis from them but instead, each child has a 1 in 4 chance of suffering from the disease.</p>\n<p>You can\u2019t catch or develop cystic fibrosis, it\u2019s something you&#8217;re born with and most cases in the UK are now diagnosed soon after birth.</p>\n<p><strong>Diagnosis of Cystic Fibrosis</strong><br />\nAfter campaigns from the CF trust all newborn babies in the UK are tested for cystic fibrosis.<br />\nThere are a number of other ways of testing for cystic fibrosis, such as the sweat test (people with cystic fibrosis have more salt in their sweat) or a genetic test, where a swab is rubbed gently on the inside of the cheek to look for the faulty gene.these tests can be carried out antenatally or for those people at high risk.</p>\n<p>There is currently no cure for Cystic Fibrosis. The treatment available is designed to alleviate the symptoms and help to manage the condition more effectively to ensure sufferers can lead their lives in as normal a way as possible.</p>\n<p><strong>How is Cystic Fibrosis treated?</strong></p>\n<p>CF is treated with a combination of medication, physiotherapy and exercise:</p>\n<p>Medication \u2013 The three main types of drugs used to treat CF in the lungs are Bronchodilator medicines to open up the airways; antibiotics to fight off infection; and steroids to ease inflammation. To aid digestion CF sufferers are also required to take pancreatic enzymes with every meal and snack. Some CF medicines such as Bronchodilators can be administered by inhalation using a nebuliser. A nebuliser is a device which transforms liquid medication into a fine mist for inhalation deep into the lungs using a mask or mouthpiece.</p>\n<p>Physiotherapy \u2013 Daily physiotherapy is essential for clearing mucus from the airways and minimising infection. Initially physiotherapy is carried out in the home by a parent or carer. Once old enough to manage their own therapy, CF sufferers will carry out their own daily routine.</p>\n<p>Exercise \u2013 Daily exercise is very important for maintaining good lung health and physical strength and is an integral part of treating and managing Cystic Fibrosis.</p>\n<p>It was great glee that I read this week on Google news the article in The Telegraph about Nick Talbot, who at the age of 41yrs is going to be climbing Everest.

He treated everyone in the same manner and it was difficult to know if he was introducing you to a patient, fellow student or visiting professor! On one occasion he introduced me to the Dalai Lama when I was in the middle of buying needles in the clinic as apparently he had asked him to pop in to the clinic in Camden whilst he was in London.</p>\n<p>On many occasions we have not only talked about medicine but shared the things that make us really appreciate our health and enrich our lives: art and culture; music and poetry; food and song as he felt that these are the things that can bring cultures closer together and lead to fruitful integration.</p>\n<p>He worked passionately with boundless energy aiming to integrate Eastern and Western medicine for over four decades. Professor Mei was actively involved in many leading academic and clinical institutions in developing a global integrative model for medicine. His passion inspired his vision for a globalised medicine that cares for humanity and a new paradigm of medicine and health.<br />\nHe revolutionised modern Chinese medicine through his invention of the world\u2019s first disposable acupuncture needle and designed the earliest range of micro-processor electro acupuncture and TENS apparatuses.

As 2013 is drawing to a close we look forward to the year of the Wooden Horse that will set the milestone for the next decade to come. According to the Chinese zodiac, this is the energetic cycle of Qi that will manifest itself in a qualitative manner that will influence our health, personal relationships as well as the social and natural phenomena. All the knowledge of the human race will be needed to help us move towards the next horizon in enlightenment.</p>\n<p>At this defining moment in history, science and philosophy will engage in a dialogue that will shape our future reality. This may be a sober thought for the new year festivities, but I myself am looking forward to the burst of new energy and to share with you the hope and the excitement of the arrival of a new axial age.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s enjoy this moment of festivities with the tea of life and the wine of wisdom. The Chinese Taoist notion of \u201cwu wei er wei zi (\u65e0\u4e3a\u800c\u4e3a\u4e4b)\u201d which means \u201cdoing as if you are not doing\u201d is a pearl of wisdom for this moment. As the natural environment is being increasingly damaged by our deterministic actions, we need to learn to act within the ways of nature, rather than recklessly changing it according to our own image. Ceaseless economic growth should be in tune with the ecology of our earth. To me, meaningful living is to be at one with nature.</p>\n<p>Goethe once said \u201cThe soul that sees beauty may sometimes walk alone.\u201d This brings me to an important principle in Chinese medicine regarding the \u2018heart\u2019 in relation to the mind and body. In many ways we are all artists in life. As we cultivate our heart to achieve clarity of mind we may be feeling alone. But are we really alone? The heart is not only affecting our physical wellbeing but is also affecting our relationship with our surroundings.

What you have done, how have you performed since your last appraisal and what you are going to do in the next year with a particular emphasis on addressing your learning needs and how you can improve patient care.</p>\n<p>You will all be aware that in General Practise we are going through significant changes and we will have more than enough to think about regarding organisational changes. However, we all like to remind ourselves that besides this that health and ways of treating medical conditions are also changing considerably.<br />\nLast year as well as attending many meetings regarding organisational changes I attended meetings to discuss particular patients (with their consent) with other GP&#8217;s, specialists and other health care professionals how their care could be improved within primary care.<br />\nI also attended structured lectures or small seminars on specific medical problems and I decided to focus on cardiology.<br />\nBy doing all this it has a significant impact on patient care in that it improves skills of diagnosing a condition, knowledge of appropriate treatment and to find a propitious time for referral.</p>\n<p>Heart failure has been something that Dr Livingston and myself looked at and during the past year we have significantly improved our way of diagnosing much earlier and being able to refer to a cardiology outpatient clinic rather than the patient presenting in a more advanced state and needing emergency admission often in extremis.<br />\n<strong>What is heart failure?</strong><br />\nHeart failure affects 800,000 people in the UK. It is a serious condition caused by the heart failing to pump enough blood around the body at the right pressure.<br />\nIt usually occurs because the heart muscle has become too weak or stiff to work properly.<br />\nIf you have heart failure it does not mean that your heart is about to stop working. It means that your heart needs some support to do its job, usually in the form of medicines.<br />\nBreathlessness, feeling very tired and ankle swelling are the main symptoms of heart failure. Living with severe heart failure is a constant fight for life. Every year, thousands more families have to watch the people they love struggle with the distressing symptoms.<br />\nThe symptoms of heart failure usually develop quickly (acute heart failure), but they can also develop gradually (chronic heart failure).<br />\nIt is often difficult to diagnose as it has many causes and can occur when a number of problems usually &#8216;gang up&#8217; on the heart, causing it to fail.<br />\nTo learn more about heart failure the following website may be helpful:-<br />\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.heartfailurematters.org/EN/Patient-Experience/EN-Patient-experience\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.heartfailurematters.org/EN/Patient-Experience/EN-Patient-experience</a></strong><br />\nThis will also outline how patients with heart failure can adapt their lifestyle and detect early warning signs.</p>\n<p>a<img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-332\" alt=\"British heart foundation\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image54.jpg?w=84&#038;h=110\" width=\"84\" height=\"110\" />. This\u00a0month the British Heart Foundation has launched a research programme &#8216;Mending Broken Hearts&#8217; at a critical stage in the UK in the fight against heart failure.</p>\n<p>When you have a heart attack your heart will suffer damage that can never be repaired. In some people this can lead to heart failure, which in severe cases leaves you disabled and gasping for breath, with a life expectancy of less than five years. Oi</p>\n<p>Living with severe heart failure is a constant fight for life. Every year, thousands more families have to watch the people they love struggle with the distressing symptoms.</p>\n<p>Until now, there has been no hope of a cure. No way to mend a broken heart. But with recent advances in regenerative medicine, repairing a damaged heart is a realistic goal.<br />\n<strong>Mending Broken Hearts </strong>is the most ambitious research programme the BHF have ever carried out.</p>\n<p>Researchers co-funded by the BHF have identified a molecule that tells certain stem cells in the embryo whether to become either heart muscle or blood vessel cells.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/image5.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1536\" alt=\"Zebra fish\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/image5.jpg?w=300&#038;h=143\" width=\"300\" height=\"143\" /></a><br />\nThe discovery \u2013 in zebrafish \u2013 tells us more about the origin of cells in the adult heart. This takes us another step closer to being able to make new heart muscle to repair the damage caused by heart attack \u2013 mending broken hearts.<br />\nZebrafish are useful to scientists because they have a fully functioning simple heart and circulatory system. If part of their heart is removed, they can grow it back in a matter of weeks.<br />\nIntriguingly, the researchers believe that this molecule \u2013 called Fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) &#8211; is also the evolutionary switch that made complex four-chambered human hearts possible, from the two-chambered &#8216;tube&#8217; we see in fish.</p>\n<p>This provides important clues to researchers working towards the goal of mending broken hearts<br />\nThe team from the University of Oxford \u2013 a BHF Centre of Research Excellence \u2013 say that during evolution a rise in Fgf levels tipped the balance so that more heart muscle was formed, meaning that the heart could become bigger and support a larger animal.<br />\nProfessor Roger Patient, who led the research, said: &#8220;If we can find stem cells in the adult human heart that have the potential to form heart muscle and blood vessels, we may be able to manipulate this Fgf switch and create brand new heart muscle. This could bring significant benefit to heart attack patients or people with heart defects. At the very least, our research will help the production of these cells in the laboratory for use in heart repair.<br />\nScientists have found another fish with similar powers and hope to harness it to help us mend broken hearts.<br />\nAn amazing species of fish \u2013 called Astyanax mexicanus \u2013 could help scientists come up with a way to mend broken hearts damaged by heart attack.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/image6.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1537\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/image6.jpg?w=210&#038;h=137\" width=\"210\" height=\"137\" /></a><br />\nResearch at University College London, led by Dr Yoshiyuki Yamamoto and Dr Mathila Mommersteeg is now being funded by the British Heart Foundation. These top scientists are interested in this fish, a close relative of the zebrafish, because it has the amazing ability to regenerate its heart tissue after damage. What\u2019s unusual about Astyanax mexicanus is that it exists in two forms \u2013 sighted fish that live in rivers, and blind cavefish.<br />\nDespite being the same species, the river-dwelling fish can regenerate its heart tissue after damage \u2013 the cavefish cannot. Scientists want to understand the differences between these fish so they can learn more about what allows the river fish to mend its own heart.<br />\nResearch like this helps provide clues towards finding a cure for heart failure.<br />\nNext time you visit The British Heart Foundation shops in West Ealing to either purchase or donate furniture or other items which they will collect free of charge you will be donating towards this important research.<br />\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.bhf.org.uk/shop/our-local-shops.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.bhf.org.uk/shop/our-local-shops.aspx</a></strong></p>\n", "post_id": 1502, "location": false, "date": "02-02-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Dengue fever", "Infectious disease", "Health", "Mosquito"], "text": "<p>Last year I wrote about Dengue Fever<br />\n<strong><a href=\"http://102theavenue.wordpress.com/2013/05/17/dengue-fever/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://102theavenue.wordpress.com/2013/05/17/dengue-fever/</a> </strong><br />\nand this blog was visited by many readers.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/dengue-fever.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-63\" alt=\"dengue fever\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/dengue-fever.jpg?w=300&#038;h=187\" width=\"300\" height=\"187\" /></a><br />\nLast weekend I was working in West Middlesex in the PCC at the weekend and a mother came in with her sick child and was very worried as she had just returned from Malaysia and Dengue fever was rife.

According to legend, during his imprisonment, he healed the daughter of his jailer, Asterius and to show his silent love for her, before his execution he wrote her a letter signed &#8220;Your Valentine&#8221; as a farewell.</p>\n<p>During my studies of Traditional Chinese medicine based on teachings passed down over thousands of years the symptoms of heart imbalance include palpitations, shortness of breath, sweating easily, mental restlessness, insomnia, forgetfulness, chest pain, tongue pain, and burning urine. Hence, in order to prevent heart disease it is important to look after your emotional health, mental function, memory, and spirituality (in the sense of being at ease with oneself) as well as maintaining a good lifestyle.<br />\nThe role of the heart (xin), known in traditional Chinese physiology as the ruler of the other organs, has exceptional importance. Its function in traditional Chinese medicine parallels its Western anatomic function of pumping blood throughout the body to maintain life.</p>\n<p>There are many different terms used in Chinese to signify the psyche or mind, but in medical literature words that include Spirit (or Shen) is commonly used. In a similar way the prefix \u2018psycho\u2019 is used in western medical terms. It refers to our physiological vitality as well as consciousness, and the function of thinking and feeling. This \u2018spirit of mind\u2019 is said to reside in the Heart and its outward manifestation are our emotions. Hence, the concept of Spirit or Shen in Chinese Medicine is not \u2018spiritual\u2019 in any conventional religious sense. Psychological diseases are seen as pathological abnormalities of the Shen, which reside in the Heart. The channels of energy for different organs are known as Meridians.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/image24.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-1591\" alt=\"Heart meridian\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/image24.jpg?w=153&#038;h=200\" width=\"153\" height=\"200\" /></a>The Heart Meridian starts from the heart, and divides into three branches. One of these branches emerges under the arm and runs along the inner side of the forearm, elbow and upper arm. It then crosses the inner side of the wrist and palm and ends at the inside tip of the little finger. \u00a0Along the Meridian at the wrist is an acupuncture point known the Shen Men and this a well known point to use for calming the mind. There is another Shen Men point on the upper earlobe also used to calm the mind. I noticed that both Princess Diana and Cherie Blair had Chinese herbs applied in these points when they were going through personal stresses. I frequently use this acupuncture point for anyone suffering stress or anxiety and to help people attempting to quit smoking with good effect.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/image20.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1587\" alt=\"Heart pinyin\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/image20.jpg?w=150&#038;h=97\" width=\"150\" height=\"97\" /></a>The Chinese view of the Heart is more than just a pump to move blood. The Chinese pinyin character of the Heart not only reflects the physical shape of the Heart, but also that it is a bowl or receptacle that communicates and governs the body, bringing animation to life and a &#8216;joie de vivre&#8217;. The Heart is the reason why we have to go and see wonderful scenery, be well rested, have good food and drink, in order that life is more refined.<br />\nHowever, the key to this radiating Shen is that it comes from a space or void that is the receptacle of the Heart. To achieve this space the Heart must be calm, tranquil and peaceful so the communication of Shen is not blocked or obstructed.</p>\n<p>The flow of energy or Qi, as it is described in Chinese Medicine, ensures that the joy of living is felt. If we pursue our Western lifestyle of being constantly \u2018on the go\u2019, striving for more possessions, more knowledge, constantly stimulating our senses, we are filling up our Heart receptacle, which is then blocking the free communication, and movement of our Shen and making us vulnerable to disease and psychological disorders.</p>\n<p>The Heart oversees the functioning of the body so that happiness or unhappiness, illness or health, longevity or premature death all depend on the Heart.</p>\n<p>That is an Eastern perception but when I reviewed the empirical research of Friedman &amp; Rosenman (1959) (both cardiologists) there seemed to be some remarkable similarities!<br />\nThey found that people with type A personality run a higher risk of heart disease and high blood pressure than type Bs.<br />\nTheir theory was based on an observation of the patients with heart conditions in their waiting room.</p>\n<p>Unlike most patients, who wait patiently, some people seemed unable to sit in their seats for long and wore out the chairs. They tended to sit on the edge of the seat and leaped up frequently.</p>\n<p>What was unusual was that the chairs were worn down on the front edges of the seats and armrests instead of on the back areas, which would have been more typical. They were as tense as racehorses at the gate. The two doctors labeled this behavior type A personality.<br />\nThey conducted a longitudinal study to test their hypothesis, in which 3200 middle aged managers and executives (all men) were given questionnaires over a eight and a half year duration.</p>\n<p>Examples of questions asked by Friedman &amp; Rosenman:</p>\n<p>\u2022 Do you feel guilty if you use spare time to relax?</p>\n<p>\u2022 Do you need to win in order to derive enjoyment from games and sports?</p>\n<p>\u2022 Do you generally move, walk and eat rapidly?</p>\n<p>\u2022 Do you often try to do more than one thing at a time?<br />\nFrom their responses, and from their manner, each participant was put into one of three groups:</p>\n<p>Type A behavior: competitive, ambitious, impatient, aggressive, fast talking.</p>\n<p>Type B behavior: relaxed, non-competitive.</p>\n<p>Type C behavior: \u2018nice,\u2019 hard working but become apathetic when faced with stress<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/image23.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1590\" alt=\"Type A personality\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/image23.jpg?w=300&#038;h=240\" width=\"300\" height=\"240\" /></a><br />\nEight years later 257 of the participants had developed coronary heart disease. By the end of the study 70% of the men who had developed coronary heart disease (CHD) were type A personalities.</p>\n<p>The behavior type A personality types makes them more prone to stress-related illnesses such as CHD, raised blood pressure etc.</p>\n<p>Despite this study having been carried out in the 1950&#8242;s and with limitations it still seems to be upheld.<br />\nIt is not surprising there is such an increase in meditation, mindfulness and yoga amongst those experiencing stress. Research has shown that by participating in regular yoga and /or meditation there is a significant decrease in blood pressure.</p>\n<p>Look after your heart and the hearts of those around you by having a calm, peaceful and happy day.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/image25.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-1592\" alt=\"Heart\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/image25.jpg?w=150&#038;h=112\" width=\"150\" height=\"112\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 1581, "location": false, "date": "02-13-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["EalingHELP", "Ealing", "Jointly", "Ecil", "Carers", "Care UK"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/image26.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1597\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/image26.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=446\"   /></a>During my many years as a GP I have been amazed at how some people dedicate their lives to caring for family members or friends.

This could be caring for a friend or family member who due to illness, disability, a mental health problem or an addiction cannot cope without their support.<br />\nAnyone can become a carer; carers come from all walks of life, all cultures and can be of any age. Many feel they are doing what anyone else would in the same situation; looking after their mother, son, or best friend and just getting on with it.<br />\nCarers don\u2019t choose to become carers: it just happens and they have to get on with it; if they did not do it, who would and what would happen to the person they care for?<br />\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.carers.org/co-op-charity-year\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.carers.org/co-op-charity-year</a></strong></p>\n<p>One of my first experiences of witnessing the unceasing dedicated work of a carer was Gwen who was caring for husband Tom. Tom had been suffering from multiple sclerosis since the age of 42yrs having worked underground as a miner since he was a young boy. He was now in his 60&#8242;s and had been bedbound for many years and was totally reliant on his wife to even change position in bed. Gwen would not even contemplate respite care for him and dutifully tended his needs every day and night. Her family were concerned for their mother&#8217;s health hence we decided to write to the MS Society asking if they could fund an adjustable bed as an aid for Gwen when lifting Tom to change him. I recall the day vividly when I was invited along with neighbours and family to see the new bed arrive. Tom was absolutely thrilled because for the first time in many years he could be raised to a sitting position and watch the children playing in the park and to become part of the World outside again. Gwen was pleased to have the mechanical help to change his posture especially as she had been getting tired and weary but now could relax with him and view the world together. Carers requests are often so humble and unless someone makes the request on their behalf they ask for very little.</p>\n<p>At last it is being recognised, after a year-long investigation by Carers UK the stark reality faced by those looking after loved ones who are older, disabled or seriously ill: loss of savings, debt and struggling to afford food and heating aswell as the physical and mental sufferings of the carer.<br />\nRead how Carers UK are helping carers and their families<br />\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.carersuk.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.carersuk.org</a></strong><br />\nThis website will also provide information for you to find out about your local services.</p>\n<p><strong>Ealing Carers\u2019 Centre</strong><br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/image28.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1600\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/image28.jpg?w=150&#038;h=119\" width=\"150\" height=\"119\" /></a> This is a resource and support centre for all unpaid carers, of any age, in the borough.

I pride myself in knowing the young children in the practise but on this occasion I could not \u00a0recall having seen Ella. When I phoned, even after talking to the mum I still could not think who we were discussing even after asking mum directly. Mum&#8217;s main worry was that Ella was constipated and all she wanted was something to ease the problem. With a combination of not knowing the baby and the fact she was under 12months I was not happy to prescribe anything over the telephone so I asked the mum to bring her to the surgery.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/image1.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1688\" alt=\"Examination of baby\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/image1.jpg?w=300&#038;h=130\" width=\"300\" height=\"130\" /></a><br />\nAfter about half an hour mum arrived carrying Ella. Mum was a short slim lady, hence I would not have expected to see a large baby but this baby was pale and small and certainly not at all wholesome. Infact I was instantly concerned. When a baby is not thriving it can be for absolutely any reason \u00a0and it was imperative that the infant was examined thoroughly. It was not long before I discovered the reason. Ella had a loud machinery heart murmur diagnostic of an atrial septal defect (hole in the heart) and was in heart failure with a very fast heart rate \u00a0and poor breath sounds. There was no time to waste but before doing anything I had to break the news to mum. Like many Mothers she took the news very well and was almost relieved to think she was not being an over anxious mum, but when she asked dad to come to the surgery he was devastated. Meanwhile, I had telephoned the paediatricians to arrange an urgent referral. Ella was seen promptly but it was evident this baby needed specialist care and she was eventually referred to Great Ormond Street after stabilising her heart failure. Ella went on to have open heart surgery and made an excellent recovery. The memory of this came back a couple of weeks ago when she ran upstairs ahead of mother for her routine immunisation full of chat about school and thrilled to let me see her scar and listen to her heart and share her story with the medical student.</p>\n<p>Congenital heart disease is caused when something disrupts the normal development of the heart. As a baby develops during pregnancy, there are normally several openings in the wall dividing the upper chambers of the heart (atria). These usually close during pregnancy or shortly after birth. In this case it was a failure of a hole in the wall between the two upper chambers of the heart to close.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/image2.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1689\" alt=\"Heart-ASD\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/image2.jpg?w=270&#038;h=176\" width=\"270\" height=\"176\" /></a><br />\nIt&#8217;s thought most cases of congenital heart disease occur when something affects the heart&#8217;s development during about week five of pregnancy.

These places can usually only share information from your records by letter, email, fax or phone. At times, this can slow down treatment and sometimes make it hard to access information.<br />\nSummary Care Records are being introduced to improve the safety and quality of patient care. Because the Summary Care Record is an electronic record, it will give healthcare staff faster, easier access to essential information about you, and help to give you safe treatment during an emergency or when your GP surgery is closed.</p>\n<p>For example, a person who lives in London is on holiday in Brighton. One evening, they&#8217;re knocked unconscious in a car accident and taken to an accident and emergency (A&amp;E) department. Under the current system of storing health records, it would be difficult for A&amp;E staff to find out whether there are any important factors to consider when treating the person (such as any serious allergies to medications), especially as their GP surgery is likely to be closed. If healthcare staff cannot get the relevant health information quickly, some patients may be at risk.</p>\n<p>A Summary Care Record is an electronic record that&#8217;s stored at a central location. As the name suggests, the record will not contain detailed information about your medical history, but will only contain important health information, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>whether you&#8217;re taking any prescription medication</li>\n<li>whether you have any allergies</li>\n<li>whether you&#8217;ve previously had a bad reaction to any medication</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Access to your Summary Care Record will be strictly controlled. The only people who can see the information will be healthcare staff directly involved in your care who have a special smartcard and access number (like a chip-and-pin credit card). These are currently used in the surgery by all staff but only to obtain information about patients registered at the practice.<br />\nHealthcare staff will ask your permission every time they need to look at your Summary Care Record. If they cannot ask you, e.g. because you&#8217;re unconscious, healthcare staff may look at your record without asking you. If they have to do this, they will make a note on your record.</p>\n<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/3Pkb65rwZVI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span>\n<p><strong>ABOUT HEALTH RECORDS</strong></p>\n<p>When I see patients in a different setting eg in an Urgent Care Centre or Walk in centre patients are often surprised that I do not know anything about them ie their present medication or ongoing illnesses not appreciating that there is no electronic connection between different medical centres and especially those people who have complex problems it would be a great advantage to have that connection.</p>\n<p>Health records play an important role in modern healthcare. They have two main functions, which are described as either primary or secondary.</p>\n<p><strong>Primary function of health records</strong></p>\n<p>The primary function of healthcare records is to record important clinical information, which may need to be accessed by the healthcare professionals involved in your care.<br />\nInformation contained in health records includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the treatments you have received,</li>\n<li>whether you have any allergies,</li>\n<li>whether you&#8217;re currently taking medication,</li>\n<li>whether you have previously had any adverse reactions to certain medications</li>\n<li>whether you have any chronic (long-lasting) health conditions, such as diabetes or asthma,</li>\n<li>the results of any health tests you have had, such as blood pressure tests,<br />\nany lifestyle information that may be clinically relevant, such as whether you smoke, and<br />\npersonal information, such as your age and address.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Secondary function of health records</strong></p>\n<p>Health records can be used to improve public health and the services provided by the NHS, such as treatments for cancer or diabetes. Health records can also be used:<br />\nto determine how well a particular hospital or specialist unit is performing,<br />\nto track the spread of, or risk factors for, a particular disease (epidemiology), and<br />\nin clinical research, to determine whether certain treatments are more effective than others.<br />\nWhen health records are used in this way, your personal details are <strong>not</strong> given to the people who are carrying out the research. Only the relevant clinical data is given, for example the number of people who were admitted to hospital every year due to a heart attack.</p>\n<p><strong>Types of health record</strong></p>\n<p>Health records take many forms and can be on paper or electronic. Different types of health record include:</p>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li>consultation notes, which your GP takes during an appointment,</li>\n<li>hospital admission records, including the reason you were admitted to hospital,<br />\nthe treatment you will receive and any other relevant clinical and personal information,</li>\n<li>hospital discharge records, which will include the results of treatment and whether any follow-up appointments or care are required,<br />\ntest results,X-rays,photographs, and image slides, such as those produced by a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computerised tomography (CT) scanner.</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Confidentiality</strong></p>\n<p>There are strict laws and regulations to ensure that your health records are kept confidential and can only be accessed by health professionals directly involved in your care.<br />\nThere are a number of different laws that relate to health records. The two most important laws are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Data Protection Act (1998)</strong><br />\nUnder the terms of the Data Protection Act (1998), organisations such as the NHS must ensure that any personal information it gathers in the course of its work is:<br />\nonly used for the stated purpose of gathering the information (which in this case would be to ensure that you receive a good standard of healthcare), and<br />\nkept secure.<br />\nIt is a criminal offence to breach the Data Protection Act (1998) and doing so can result in imprisonment.</li>\n<li><strong>Human Rights Act (1998).</strong><br />\nThe Human Rights Act (1998) also states that everyone has the right to have their private life respected. This includes the right to keep your health records confidential.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/image20.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-995\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/image20.jpg?w=150&#038;h=38\" width=\"150\" height=\"38\" /></a><strong>For further information</strong> &#8211; the Health and Social Care Information Centre is a public body which have been appointed to ensure a high quality information is used appropriately to improve patient care and have published the following document to address questions patients may ask:-<br />\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/thenhs/records/healthrecords/Documents/Care.data%20patient%20FAQs%20V3%2019022014.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/thenhs/records/healthrecords/Documents/Care.data%20patient%20FAQs%20V3%2019022014.pdf</a></strong></p>\n", "post_id": 1668, "location": false, "date": "02-22-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Heart", "heart block", "Health"], "text": "<p>My next memorable story:-<br />\nI had only been working in General Practise for a few weeks and was well aware that patients I saw were either new patients or those who could not get an appointment with their usual doctor and reluctantly \u00a0were willing to consult with the &#8216;new&#8217; doctor.</p>\n<p>As I was the doctor on call for home visits that day I remember being asked to go out on an emergency call to a patient with chest pain.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/image3.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1692\" alt=\"Doctors bag\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/image3.jpg?w=300&#038;h=235\" width=\"300\" height=\"235\" /></a><br />\nI arrived at a block of flats and made my way to the second floor and after knocking the door a distant,weak, breathless voice requested that I \u00a0should \u00a0enter. There was Mrs. Evans\u00a0sitting in a chair, breathless clutching her chest and a look of great dismay at seeing a strange doctor arrive ( patients at that time were used to seeing &#8216;their doctor&#8217; call at any time of day or night and wanted an explanation as to why a strange doctor was present) \u00a0I immediately apologised and gave a feeble excuse as to why Dr Llewellyn was not available. It was immediately evident that she needed urgent hospital admission. After a brief explanation of my concern I asked to use her telephone (mobile phones did not exist) as I wanted to call an ambulance. I had read her notes prior to the visit and after arriving took a brief recent history of her current problem. I was aware she had a pacemaker fitted and she had had heart problems and that day had felt very weak, dizzy and tired. Before I had chance to fully examine her she suddenly arched her back gasping and at the same time exclaiming, &#8220;I want to change my will, I want to change my will,&#8221; and then slumped back in the chair lifeless. I gently pulled her to the floor and started cardiac massage and within the next minute or so the ambulance-men arrived with oxygen and ambu-bag.<br />\nShe became vaguely conscious and she was carried by stretcher to the ambulance. Her pulse \u00a0remained very slow and \u00a0I assumed her pacemaker was failing and she needed to go to Cardiff which was about 20 miles away, as the local hospital would not be able to replace the pacemaker. In those days ambulances were minimally equipped and ambulance-men had very limited first aid training so they relied on the GP to advise the best course of action. Having recently\u00a0worked \u00a0on a busy general medical ward I was well versed at stabilising patients before transfer to a specialist unit. Hence, I directed the ambulance to the local cottage hospital and \u00a0there I put up an intravenous infusion with isoprenaline to maintain the heart rate until the patient reached Cardiff. Giving the accompanying experienced nurse appropriate instructions the ambulance sped off in haste along narrow roads to its destination. In due course \u00a0Mrs.Evans was fitted with a new pacemaker and discharged after 10 days.<br />\nThe day after her discharge\u00a0I was sitting in my consulting room in earshot of reception when I heard a bold voice exclaim, &#8220;I would like to see a doctor but please don&#8217;t let me see that dreadful doctor that thumped me on the chest and took me to the wrong hospital. I am lucky to be alive!&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mrs.Evans had had a pacemaker fitted to treat third degree heart block which is a problem that occurs with the heart&#8217;s electrical system. This system controls the rate and rhythm of heartbeats. (&#8220;Rate&#8221; refers to the number of times your heart beats per minute. &#8220;Rhythm&#8221; refers to the pattern of regular or irregular pulses produced as the heart beats.)<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/image4.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1693\" alt=\"Heart block\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/image4.jpg?w=255&#038;h=300\"   /></a>With each heartbeat, an electrical signal spreads across the heart from the upper to the lower chambers. As it travels, the signal causes the heart to contract and pump blood.<br />\nHeart block occurs if the electrical signal is slowed or disrupted as it moves through the heart.</p>\n<p>Third-degree heart block limits the heart&#8217;s ability to pump blood to the rest of the body. This type of heart block may cause fatigue (tiredness), dizziness, and fainting. Third-degree heart block requires prompt treatment because it can be fatal.</p>\n<p>I would like to think that I had saved her life but the patient never recognised that.

It was named St.Vitus Dance as St Vitus is patron saint of dancers. This condition was not uncommon many years ago And was found to be more common in females than males, most patients were children, below 18 years of age.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/image8.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1701\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/image8.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" alt=\"St Vitus dance\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a><br />\nIt was caused as a result of Group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus infection and occurred in 20-30% of patients of patients with Rheumatic Fever or up to 6 months following the acute infection.<br />\nA vast majority of people at sometime in their life will develop a streptococcal infection of the throat characterised by a fever and white spots on the tonsils and swollen neck glands but nowadays this can be easily treated with antibiotics, usually Penicillin with good effect and it is very rarely associated with more widespread infections other than Scarlet Fever.<br />\nIt was not uncommon in the 1950,s and 1960&#8242;s and I recall my mother saying to me as a child if I was fidgeting excessively, &#8220;Keep still have you got St Vitus Dance.?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mrs.Jones went on to develop an inflammation of the heart and the important valves of her heart were damaged. In my early days in Medicine I saw many patients with Rheumatic Heart Disease and we were disciplined in medical school to train our ears to listen out for murmurs in the heart using our stethoscopes in order to diagnose this problem. Patients were after brought in as test cases for our final examination. At that time we did not have the technology to aid our diagnoses. Needless to say not every medical student acquired this skill and as qualified doctors still could not pick out a murmur on auscultation. This resulted in many people remaining undiagnosed until they were having emergency surgery or developed another illness or went into heart failure during childbirth.<br />\nI recall several maternal deaths due to this at that time and young adults being diagnosed and needing heart surgery often carried out by a General Surgeons.<br />\nUltimately,pig heart valves were used to treat these patients and then metal artificial valves, the clicking of which was audible to the patient and they often complained that it kept them awake at night.</p>\n<p>Mrs.Jones tended to restrict her lifestyle and grew up as a slim,but feisty young woman and then decided to study for nursing at St. Mary&#8217;s hospital and it was when she became pregnant that her heart condition was diagnosed.</p>\n<p>When she acquired St Vitus Dance she was not able to be treated with Penicillin as it had not been discovered when she developed this illness. Fleming recounted that the date of his discovery of penicillin was on the morning of Friday, September 28, 1928. It was a fortuitous accident: in his laboratory in the basement of St. Mary&#8217;s Hospital in London (now part of Imperial College).</p>\n<p>As a result of this disease she developed significant valvular heart disease and miraculously survived and infact was nearly 90yrs before she died. She had the complication of Atrial fibrillation which is a heart condition that causes an irregular and often abnormally fast heart rate.<br />\n<a href=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/image17.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1772\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/image17.jpg?w=300&#038;h=191\" alt=\"image\" width=\"300\" height=\"191\" /></a></p>\n<p>A normal heart rate should be between 60 and 100 beats a minute when you are resting, and is regular. You can measure your heart rate by feeling the pulse in your wrist or neck. In atrial fibrillation, the heart rate may be over 140 beats a minute, although it can be any speed.<br />\nThe main difference between a normal rhythm and atrial fibrillation is that you are unable to predict when the next heart beat will come along, as the heart rate is irregular.<br />\nThis may lead to a number of problems, including dizziness and shortness of breath. You may also be aware of a fast and irregular heartbeat (palpitations) and feel very tired, breathlessness, dizzy and can experience chest pain (angina) but the worst fear is having a stroke.</p>\n<p>Moreover,the way the heart beats in atrial fibrillation it reduces the heart&#8217;s efficiency and performance. This can result in low blood pressure and heart failure.</p>\n<p>Mrs.Jones was able to tap out her atrial fibrillation in the surgery our on visits to the hospital and gleefully educated many student nurses and doctors into recognising this condition. Remarkably, she only developed mild heart failure and never had a stroke.<br />\nIf you look at my previous blog this will demonstrate how to take the pulse and to recognise atrial fibrillation</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://102theavenue.wordpress.com/2014/02/07/know-your-pulse/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://102theavenue.wordpress.com/2014/02/07/know-your-pulse/</a> \u200e</strong><br />\nOr upload the app below on to your iPhone &#8211; my son assures me it is easy to use<br />\n<a href=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/image18.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1773\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/image18.jpg?w=300&#038;h=296\" alt=\"image\" width=\"300\" height=\"296\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>When to see your GP</strong><br />\nMake an appointment to see your GP if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you notice a sudden change in your heartbeat</li>\n<li>your heart rate is consistently lower than 60 or above 100 &#8211; especially if you are experiencing other symptoms of atrial fibrillation</li>\n<li>See your GP as soon as possible if you have chest pain.</li>\n<li>If you notice a sudden change in your heartbeat and have chest pain, see your doctor immediately.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What is happening in the heart when someone develops atrial fibrillation.</strong></p>\n<p>The atria are the upper two chambers of the heart that receive blood from the rest of the body. They pump blood into the lower two chambers (the ventricles). Then the ventricles pump blood to the rest of the body. During atrial fibrillation, the atria do not beat normally. Instead, they quiver or &#8220;fibrillate.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Normally, electrical impulses from a small part of the atrium called the sinus node cause the atria to beat. The electrical signal then goes through another part of the heart called the atrioventricular node. Then it goes down to the ventricles, and causes them to beat. First the atria, then the ventricles: it is coordinated, and so the heart pumps blood efficiently. The atria pump, filling the ventricles with blood, and then the ventricles pump.</p>\n<p>In contrast, during atrial fibrillation, the electrical impulses come from all over the atria. Instead of pumping efficiently, the atria just quiver. There is an irregular and rapid heartbeat. There is no coordination between the atria and the ventricles. As a result, the atria do not pump all of their blood into the ventricles. Also, the ventricles sometimes pump when they don\u2019t have a lot of blood in them.</p>\n<p>A normal heartbeat is 60 to 100 beats per minute, and very regular: beat\u2026beat\u2026beat\u2026beat. During atrial fibrillation, the heart beats at 80 to 160 beats per minute, and is very irregular: beat..beat\u2026..beat\u2026.beat.beat.beat\u2026.beat.<br />\nWhen the hearts beats rapidly and irregularly, it cannot pump blood out of the heart efficiently. As a result, some people get short of breath. Some people faint.</p>\n<p>Atrial fibrillation can lead to the formation of blood clots inside the atria. This is a serious, longer-term problem. These blood clots can travel out of the heart and get stuck in an artery to the lungs (causing a pulmonary embolism), an artery to the brain (causing a stroke) or an artery elsewhere in the body.</p>\n<p><strong>How atrial fibrillation is treated</strong><br />\nbearing in mind that even if the atrial fibrillation is intermittent it still poses a risk of developing a stroke.</p>\n<p>Treatment may involve:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>medication to prevent a stroke by calculating the level of risk</li>\n<li>medication to control the heart rate or rhythm</li>\n<li>cardioversion, where the heart is given a controlled electric shock to restore normal rhythm</li>\n<li>Catheter ablation, to prevent atrial fibrillation from occurring</li>\n<li>having a pacemaker fitted to help your heart beat regularly</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Atrial-fibrillation/Pages/Treatment.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Atrial-fibrillation/Pages/Treatment.aspx</a></p>\n<p>Especially during the past 12months Dr Livingston and myself along with our practise nurse have been on a mission to pick up undiagnosed cases of atrial fibrillation and we have diagnosed several cases and they have been treated accordingly.

One such patient came to me following a panic attack ( an extreme feeling of fear ) which occurred just before she about to sing a second Aria on Christmas Eve at the Chapel Royal. She had sung the first Aria beautifully then she became so overcome with anxiety she was unable to sing the second Aria.<br />\nShe had graduated from Cambridge with a double First in Music and was about to launch on a career of being an Opera singer. She was devastated and felt her whole life had crumbled. Thankfully with treatment she overcame this anxiety and was a wonderful moment when I went to hear her sing in an Opera at St.Brides, Fleet Street. I think I was more anxious than she was! She then literally went off into the World to sing.<br />\nOther patients never make to the surgery but languish in there beds or at home too fearful to seek help.<br />\nThese are the sort of patients that cannot wait in the waiting room and pace up and down the corridor or outside, desperate, on edge,trembling, asking for a glass of water or may simply walk out. Having talked to them I have shared their feelings, felt their anxiety and fears and now we try to arrange a time when they can come to be seen with a minimal waiting time, and we hopefully give them time to express how they feel because I know that if they are seen we can help treat this condition and they will &#8216;go off into the world and sing&#8217;<br />\nWays we can signpost you to get help:-</p>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li>We have an in-house counsellor Tony who sees patient on a relatively quiet time in the surgery and a chance to give space to talk.</li>\n<li>a referral or self referral to IAPT<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/image1.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1730\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/image1.jpg?w=300&#038;h=81\" alt=\"IAPT\" width=\"300\" height=\"81\" /></a><br />\nYou can phone or email as below<br />\nTelephone 020 3313 5660<br />\nEmail. wellbeing.selfreferral@nhs.net</li>\n<li>we recommend self help books such as:-<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/image2.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1731\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/image2.jpg?w=196&#038;h=300\" alt=\"Mindfulness\" width=\"196\" height=\"300\" /></a><br />\nA sequel to Danny Penman&#8217;s other book &#8216; Finding peace in a Frantic World&#8217;<br />\nThese can be obtained from Amazon as a book or downloaded onto a kindle</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/image3.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1732\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/image3.jpg?w=300&#038;h=138\" alt=\"Peace\" width=\"300\" height=\"138\" /></a><br />\n<em>\u2018Want a happier, more content life?

I can remember a patient walking into &#8216;Casualty&#8217; as we referred to it with an arrow through his head ! &#8211; both an accident and an emergency!</div>\n<div>0n one occasion I attempted to administer my first tetanus injection to a miner (skin black with coal dust) and when I swabbed his skin clean he looked down at the white patch and then took flight down the corridor leaving me standing with needle and syringe. I sutured international rugby players with various lacerations.</div>\n<div>Cardiff Royal Infirmary on a\u00a0<a href=\"//0\">Saturday afternoon</a>\u00a0/evening was the ideal place to become skilled in dealing with accidents and emergencies. The reception desk was manned by stern middle aged women who vetted each person as they arrived and if they thought it was not an accident or emergency they were sent home and firmly reminded that their attendance was inappropriate.</div>\n<div>This a far cry from my experience of Hillingdon A&amp;E where I work from time to time. The receptionists at the desk book the patients in but can only mutter under their breath when they book in inappropriate attendees, the worried well, the pitifully minor injuries only needing an Elastoplast, the numerous patients who arrive with a history of having vomited 20- 30 minutes ago \u00a0or on one occasion an &#8216;intelligent&#8217; parent bringing a child who had developed abdominal pain following drinking cold milk out of the fridge. Also the repeated attendances of those who have had a condition for weeks or even months who seemingly on a whim appear in A&amp;E .</div>\n<div>There have been many changes.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Serious \u00a0trauma or medical cases brought in by ambulance enter by a separate entrance and taken straight to majors. Those with chest pain entering via A&amp;E reception are sent for triaging to majors clutching a red cardboard heart. \u00a0People who are seen at reception are sent for triage with the A&amp;E nurses and others are sent to the Urgent Care Centre where they are seen by a GP or Nurse Practitioner. There is also a clinic (Primary Care Clinic) which is run by GP&#8217;s and they are people that have phoned 111 and have been given a specific appointment.</div>\n</div>\n<div>For the most part this works well and people with significant problems are seen quickly and efficiently seen but inevitably on a Bank Holiday this may not be the case. Also the advent of the 111, \u00a0which has been in operation in Hillingdon as a pilot for longer than the recent national launch , has unfortunately had its teething problems. In Hillingdon patients and doctors feedback is taken seriously and adjustments or protocols are introduced to adapt to a change in situation ( eg regarding management of vomiting when there is an outbreak of gastroenteritis) Also, there is cooperation between all areas so that patients can be transferred to an appropriate clinician if necessary.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<div>The Faculty of Emergency Medicine only started in 1991 and was was defined by the International Federation for Emergency Medicine as:</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>&#8220;A field of practice based on the knowledge and skills required for the prevention, diagnosis and management of acute and urgent aspects of illness and injury affecting patients of all age groups with a full spectrum of undifferentiated physical and behavioural disorders. It further encompasses an understanding of the development of pre-hospital and in-hospital emergency medical systems and the skills necessary for this development.&#8221;</div>\n<div>This also means that doctors and nurse who work in these departments have had specific training in Emergency Medicine.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>The specialty of Emergency Medicine aims to provide an \u00a0around the clock care to patients who present with symptoms of acute illness and injury, across the whole age spectrum. In the UK , Emergency Medicine as a specialty is constantly adapting and developing. This has been in response to external pressures, for example the multiplicity of changes in the provision of out of hours and acute care, changes in the expectations of patients, changes in medical practice, government targets such as the \u201c4 hour target,\u201d as well as discussion and internal debate around the future direction of emergency and urgent care.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>As \u00a0I alluded to the specialty is quite different now compared to the first &#8220;casualty surgeons&#8221; in the 60&#8242;s and 70&#8242;s. \u00a0The emphasis has developed beyond simply treating traumatic injury, to encompass critical and acute care for a much wider range of problems.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Most Emergency Departments are open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. All will have resuscitation facilities for the critically ill, cubicles to see other sorts of patients, and access to investigations (such as blood tests and X-rays) to help make diagnoses.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Patients with acute illness or injury can present at any time, with a wide range of problems. Patients often have \u201cundifferentiated\u201d presentations (i.e. they don\u2019t come in with a known diagnosis), with little initial information available apart from that obtained by talking to the patient; the history, examination and bedside investigations. There is a great challenge in providing rapid and appropriate treatment in the first hours, but effective early diagnosis and treatment has been shown to make big differences for short and longer term outcome in many conditions.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>It is not possible or practical to have an experienced representative from every hospital sub-specialty standing by in the Emergency Department at all times. Emergency Medicine evolved because emergencies can occur in any age group, at any time, in one or many body systems, and emergency physicians developed expertise as specialised generalists. \u00a0This enables them to make working diagnoses, start appropriate treatment, and if the problem can\u2019t be completely fixed at the time refer on to other appropriate specialists.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<div>Not all acute problems need to be dealt with in Emergency Departments, and there are now a number of different ways in which patients can access help.

Many patients who felt well when they presented after being given medication then developed blurred vision, confusion, general weakness and nausea.

For example, based on types of foods eaten by a student (18-22 year old), a shopping basket of higher salt products can contain up to 58g of salt, while that of a mother (30-39 year old woman) can contain up to 64g of salt \u2013 the equivalent of 128 bags of crisps. However, if they were to make some simple switches to lower salt options, the shopping basket of the student could be reduced to 22g of salt and that of the mothers\u2019 could be reduced to 18g of salt, the equivalent of just 36 bags of crisps &#8211; cutting their salt intake by a staggering 62% and 72% per week respectively.

From the fall in blood pressure that was due to salt reduction, there has been a saving of approximately 18,000 stroke and heart attack events a year, 9,000 of which would have been fatal<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>Another way of reducing salt is increasing potassium but if you are taking medication for blood pressure discuss this with your doctor.</p>\n<p><strong>Why potassium helps to lower blood pressure</strong><br />\npotassium is a chemical which helps to lower blood pressure by balancing out the negative effects of salt. I heard potasquoted as&#8221;Potassium could be called the great detergent of arteries.</p>\n<p>Your kidneys help to control your blood pressure by controlling the amount of fluid stored in your body. The more fluid, the higher your blood pressure.</p>\n<p>Your kidneys do this by filtering your blood and sucking out any extra fluid, which is then stores in your bladder as urine. This process uses a delicate balance of sodium and potassium to pull the water across a wall of cells from the bloodstream into a collecting channel that leads to the bladder.</p>\n<p>Eating salt raises the amount of sodium in your bloodstream and wrecks the delicate balance, reducing the ability of your kidneys to remove the water. By eating more fruit and vegetables, you will increase your potassium levels and help to restore the delicate balance. This will help your kidneys to work more efficiently &#8211; and help to lower your blood pressure to a healthy level.</p>\n<p>However, it is possible to have too much of a good thing. To make sure that you don&#8217;t overdose on potassium, it is best to get your daily potassium from natural sources (fruit, vegetables and other foods) and avoid taking supplements.<br />\nTo reap the benefit of more potassium in your life, try to eat at least five portions of fruit and vegetables every day. (A portion is about the same size as your closed fist). Not only will this help to lower your blood pressure, it will also help you to avoid certain cancers, bowel problems and even heart attacks or strokes.</p>\n<p>Good sources of potassium include: potatoes, sweet potatoes, bananas, tomato sauce (without added salt or sugar), orange juice, tuna (fresh, frozen or tinned, but avoid tuna packed in brine), yoghurt and fat-free milk.<br />\n<a href=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/image3.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1780\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/image3.jpg?w=450&#038;h=600\" alt=\"Potassium\" width=\"450\" height=\"600\" /></a></p>\n<p>If you have kidney disease, or are taking certain blood pressure medications, a large increase in potassium could be harmful. In this case, avoid taking potassium supplements and check with your doctor before dramatically increasing your potassium intake.</p>\n<p>If your blood pressure is very high or these lifestyle changes do not reduce it enough, your doctor is likely to prescribe you medication to control it and to reduce your risk of having a heart attack or stroke.</p>\n<p><strong>Especially if you are 40 years or older get your blood pressure checked and<br />\nKNOW YOUR NUMBERS</strong></p>\n", "post_id": 1757, "location": false, "date": "06-01-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["GP", "999", "stroke", "Health", "F-A-S-T", "TIA", "CVA"], "text": "<p>When Mary O&#8217;Brien came the surgery last week and said she had difficulties getting her words out, was confused for a short period of time and couldn&#8217;t give someone basic directions this was:-<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/image11.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1760\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/image11.jpg?w=300&#038;h=194\" alt=\"image\" width=\"300\" height=\"194\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Every year at least 46,000 people in the UK have a TIA or Transient ischaemic attack (also known as mini-stroke) for the first time and although the symptoms may not last long, a TIA is still very serious.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a sign that a person is at risk of going on to have a stroke.

I certainly hope health and safety standards have now improved. During this visit I was made aware of the chemical contents of tea<br />\nwhich contains xanthine derivatives such as caffeine, theophylline, and theobromine, and the glutamide derivative theanine. These substances have well-known stimulant properties, and have also been reported to have beneficial effects on memory and on the immune system. Tea also contains many nutritional components, such as vitamin E, vitamin C, fluoride, and potassium.<br />\nThis made me appreciate why tea breaks were introduced in factories in order to calm the workers with theanine at the same time stimulating them with caffeine. Tea is thought to differ from coffee in that coffee simply stimulates without the calming effect and it was found that workers drinking tea carried on for long rather than in a short, sharp spurt. It also made sense of something I have heard on countless occasions when breaking bad news or after a sad or significant event, &#8220;shall I make a cup of tea?&#8221;<br />\nBefore soldiers departed on a mission they would often have &#8220;a mug of tea&#8221; no doubt to calm them before setting off.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/image29.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1829\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/image29.jpg?w=300&#038;h=192\" alt=\"Tea\" width=\"300\" height=\"192\" /></a><br />\nIn another context when I worked with miners who had chronic chest problems they often told me how they couldn&#8217;t get going in the morning before they had their first cup of tea &#8221; I like it strong, doctor so that the spoon stands up in it!&#8221; What they were really saying was they wanted a good dose of theophylline ( a bronchodilator) to improve their breathing.

When I told Sam he had diabetes his reply was, &#8221; Am I going to die?&#8221; My reply was &#8220;I hope not as that means I am not a very good doctor. However, I suggest that you must not smoke and night&#8217;s out with the lads heavy drinking is not for you!&#8221; He replied,&#8221;Oh that&#8217;s good I don&#8217;t smoke and I am not fond of drinking I only drink an occasional lager&#8221;</p>\n<p>I arranged for him to attend the diabetic clinic to be initiated on insulin as he was clearly a Type 1 diabetic.<br />\nSam remains well still in the same job, although thinking of joining the fire service, married with 2 children, fit as a fiddle. Diabetes does not dominate his life, he has never been in hospital,continues taking insulin and sees his doctor every 6 months for regular check ups. That how the majority of diabetics live &#8211; they can have a lager or a bar of chocolate occasionally and can become organ donors and he will be assessed on his ability to be a firefighter and will not be turned down because he has diabetes.<br />\nType 1 diabetes develops when the insulin-producing cells in the body have been destroyed and the body is unable to produce any insulin.</p>\n<p><strong>Who typically gets Type 1 diabetes</strong>?<br />\nType 1 diabetes accounts for about 10 per cent of all adults with diabetes and is treated by daily insulin injections, a healthy diet and regular physical activity. Type 1 diabetes can develop at any age but usually appears before the age of 40, and especially y in childhood. It is the most common type of diabetes found in childhood. Type 1 diabetes can&#8217;t be prevented. The body&#8217;s immune system destroys the insulin-producing cells, and nobody quite understands why.<br />\nThe vast majority of children with diabetes have Type 1 diabetes, but an increasing number are now developing Type 2 diabetes.</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding, there are those for one reason or another develop complications but for the most part the majority of people like Sam lead a normal life.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/image34.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1850\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/image34.jpg?w=300&#038;h=199\" alt=\"Diabetes\" width=\"300\" height=\"199\" /></a></p>\n<p>The rest of those patients who I picked up with glucose in the urine were older.<br />\nI particularly remember Diane, who was a 55yr old teacher very overweight, and admitted she did very little exercise. She had come to surgery feeling tired and stressed but a routine urine showed glucose. I tried to suggest that she lost weight and even suggested Bariatric surgery but she was very negative, claiming she had tried every diet and didn&#8217;t have time for exercise. As time went by she was treated for hypertension and needed to have several types of diabetic medication and the diabetes was still not satisfactorily controlled and she was not only was her weight increasing but she was developing angina. Probably dreading hearing the same old advice &#8211; diet and exercise and the suggestion of insulin she started not turning up for her appointments. At the beginning or each year we audit our patients to review those that have not been checked and her name appeared and we then ask the receptionists or nurse to phone them to make an appointment. She did make an appointment and her blood tests showed her blood glucose was running very high. When I saw her she said that her job was now becoming so stressful that she was considering early retirement and that she was now prepared to have Bariatric surgery and look seriously at her health. I was thrilled it was worth waiting for that moment. She went on to have surgery and with the support of the multidisciplinary team of dietitian, psychologist and surgeon she became motivated to eat a healthier diet, exercise and gradually as the weeks went by she stopped one medication after another. She was transformed she looked more attractive, she was happier, free from both her diabetic and blood pressure medication and the angina settled. She was now retired and set to enjoy life outside London and as she came to say goodbye she said, &#8220;Why hadn&#8217;t I done this earlier?&#8221;<br />\n<a href=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/image38.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1854\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/image38.jpg?w=300&#038;h=168\" alt=\"Diabetes\" width=\"300\" height=\"168\" /></a><br />\n<strong>Who typically gets Type 2 diabetes?</strong><br />\nType 2 diabetes usually appears in people over the age of 40, though in South Asian people, who are at greater risk, it often appears from the age of 25. It is also increasingly becoming more common in children, adolescents and young people of all ethnicities. Type 2 diabetes accounts for between 85 and 95 per cent of all people with diabetes and is treated with a healthy diet and increased physical activity. In addition to this, medication and/or insulin are often required.<br />\nIn Type 2 diabetes there is not enough insulin (or the insulin isn\u2019t working properly), so the cells are only partially unlocked and glucose builds up in the blood.<br />\nIn today&#8217;s press:-<br />\nMore than one in three adults in England are on the cusp of developing type-2 diabetes, new research suggests.<br />\nIf nothing is done to stop the trend, there will be a steep surge in this form of diabetes within the next few years, the authors of a report published in the British Medical Journal Open said.<br />\nPeople are classed as having borderline diabetes, also known as pre-diabetes, when they have blood glucose levels at the very high end of the &#8216;normal&#8217; range. Those with the condition are at high risk of developing diabetes and its associated complications.<br />\nTheir study found that in 2011, the number of people diagnosed with pre-diabetes tripled from 11.6 per cent in 2003 to 35.3 per cent.<br />\nWe now regularly screen patients not just for urine glucose but for blood glucose in an attempt to prevent the onset of diabetes.</p>\n<p><strong>It is now reported that 80% of Type 2 diabetes can be prevented by diet and exercise alone<br />\n</strong><br />\nAs I reflected it made me realise the enormous strides that have been made in medicine since I have been qualified regarding diabetes, firstly being able to diagnose it so easily with a simple dipstick and more accurate blood tests to recognise pre-diabetes as well as having the proven knowledge that leading a healthy lifestyle can prevent the onset. However, sadly many people don&#8217;t take heed of this and don&#8217;t eat healthily and live a life of a couch potato running a great risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I remember my first job as a surgical house officer there were always some patients on the ward with chronic leg ulcers, and those who had poor lower limb circulation both as a result of diabetes and who were on the surgical ward and inevitably ended up having an amputation. Many of these patients also had poor eyesight due to cataracts or diabetic retinal damage, others had had heart attacks or strokes and it was a concern whether they would able to cope with anaesthetic and had to have the surgery with a spinal block. Most of these diabetics went on to develop kidney failure but were considered unsuitable candidates for renal dialysis because of there array of other complications. They had to have peritoneal dialysis &#8211; a cumbersome way of ridding the body of liquid waste. It involved pouring large volumes of fluid into the abdomen and then flushing the fluid out. When I was a GP visiting these patients, who were discharged home for it to be carried out by the District nurse on a regular basis, sometimes daily, I remember having to squeeze past these piled up boxes in the hallway. There prognosis was poor and they often developed severe infections or went into end-stage kidney failure and died at in there 50&#8242;s. Hence, it is not surprising that many people fear this condition and feel it will alter their life.<br />\nDiets at that time consisted of large amounts of fat and sugar: the day started with a greasy cooked breakfast, puddings were a must and afternoon tea was accompanied by a selection of home-made cakes. Although exercise was part of a daily routine the television began to limit how much people did and more people bought cars, public transport improved but everyone continued with the same diet.<br />\n<a href=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/image37.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1853\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/image37.jpg?w=300&#038;h=79\" alt=\"Diet and exercise\" width=\"300\" height=\"79\" /></a><br />\nIn 2001 Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP),a large trial was carried which was scheduled to last 4years comparing a group of people who were supervised strictly to adhere to exercise and a healthy diet and a group who were not educated but the trial had to be abandoned after 3 years because it was so clear that a highly significant number were developing diabetes in the non-educated group and it was considered non-ethical not to educate everybody.<br />\nParticipants randomly assigned to intensive lifestyle intervention reduced their risk of getting type 2 diabetes by 58 percent.

sound when air is inhaled after coughing she has been in good spirits and no doubt full of questions due to her interminable curiosity.</p>\n<p><strong>What causes whooping cough</strong></p>\n<p>The bacterium infects the lining of the airways, mainly the windpipe (trachea) and the two airways that branch off from it to the lungs (the bronchi).<br />\nWhen the Bordetella pertussis bacterium comes into contact with the lining of these airways, it multiplies and causes a build-up of thick mucus. It is the mucus that causes the intense bouts of coughing as your body tries to expel it.<br />\nThe bacterium also causes the airways to swell up, making them narrower than usual. As a result, breathing is made difficult, which causes the &#8216;whoop&#8217; sound as you gasp for breath after a bout of coughing.</p>\n<p><strong>How whooping cough spreads</strong></p>\n<p>People with whooping cough are infectious from six days after exposure to the bacterium to three weeks after the &#8216;whooping&#8217; cough begins.<br />\nThe Bordetella pertussis bacterium is carried in droplets of moisture in the air. When someone with whooping cough sneezes or coughs, they propel hundreds of infected droplets into the air. If the droplets are breathed in by someone else, the bacterium will infect their airways.<br />\nThis is why it is highly contagious. I remember in 1979 I was working as a paediatric doctor and there had been a whooping cough vaccination scare resulting in a sharp increase in cases. It was pitiful to see the numerous admissions of babies and young children with distressing bouts of coughing. It is clear how when a vaccination is introduced how the incidence of the disease falls so rapidly but rises again if vaccination uptake declines.<br />\n<a href=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/image22.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1965\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/image22.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=530\" alt=\"Whooping cough\"   /></a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Treatment</strong><br />\nIf whooping cough is diagnosed during the first three weeks (21 days) of infection, a course of antibiotics may be prescribed. This is to prevent the infection being passed on to others.<br />\nIt is important to take steps to avoid spreading the infection to others, particularly babies under six months of age.<br />\nChildren with whooping cough should be kept away from school or nursery for five days from the time they start taking a prescribed course of antibiotics. The same advice applies to adults returning to work.<br />\nAs a precaution, household members of someone with whooping cough may also be given antibiotics and a booster shot of the vaccine.<br />\nAntibiotics will not usually be prescribed in cases where whooping cough is not diagnosed until the later stages of infection (2-3 weeks after the onset of symptoms).<br />\nBy this time, the Bordetella pertussis bacterium will have gone so you will no longer be infectious. It is also very unlikely that antibiotics will improve your symptoms at this stage.<br />\n<strong>Immunisation</strong></p>\n<p>Children are vaccinated against whooping cough with the 5-in-1 vaccine at two, three and four months of age, and again with the 4-in-1 pre-school booster before starting school at the age of about three years and four months.</p>\n<p><strong>Vaccination in pregnancy</strong><br />\nIn the UK, all pregnant women are offered vaccination against whooping cough when they are 28-38 weeks pregnant. Getting vaccinated while you\u2019re pregnant could help to protect your baby from developing whooping cough in its first few weeks of life.</p>\n<p>The immunity you get from the vaccine will pass to your baby through the placenta and provide passive protection for them until they are old enough to be routinely vaccinated against whooping cough at two months old.</p>\n<p><strong>Is the whooping cough vaccine safe in pregnancy?</strong><br />\nIt&#8217;s understandable that you might have concerns about the safety of having a vaccine during pregnancy, but there&#8217;s no evidence to suggest that the whooping cough vaccine is unsafe for you or your unborn baby.</p>\n<p>Pertussis-containing vaccine has been used routinely in pregnant women since October 2012 and its safety has been carefully monitored by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). The MHRA&#8217;s study of nearly 20,000 vaccinated women found no evidence of risks to pregnancy or babies.<br />\nTo date, 50-60% of eligible pregnant women (over half a million) have received the whooping cough vaccine with no safety concerns being identified in the baby or mother.<br />\nVaccination against whooping cough in pregnancy is also routinely recommended in the US and New Zealand.<br />\nThe pregnancy vaccination programme has been very effective in protecting babies until they can have their first vaccine when they are two months old.<br />\nDuring 2012, 14 babies died from whooping cough, all of whom were born before the vaccination in pregnancy programme was introduced, and developed whooping cough before they could be vaccinated themselves. The number of infant deaths from whooping cough fell to three in 2013 \u2013 all three babies were too young to have been vaccinated themselves and none of their mothers had been vaccinated in pregnancy.</p>\n<p>Further questions can be answered using the following link:-</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Whooping-cough/Pages/Prevention.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Whooping-cough/Pages/Prevention.aspx</a></p>\n", "post_id": 1901, "location": false, "date": "07-05-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["MRSA", "handwashing", "Alcohol hand rub", "Infectious disease", "health benefits", "Hand hygeine", "Clostridium Difficile"], "text": "<p>This week I had an email from one of 3rd year medical students requesting topics that her student and her partner would like to concentrate on during the next teaching session.

As a general rule, handwashing protects people ill or not at all from droplet and airborne diseases, such as measles, chickenpox, influenza, and tuberculosis. It protects best against diseases transmitted through fecal-oral routes (such as many forms of diarrhoea and vomiting) and direct physical contact (such as impetigo).

We certainly were not taught hand washing formally let alone as part of our examinations and it is only in recent years probably since the swine flu epidemic has there been the stress on prevention of the spread of infection and emphasis of handwashing and using hand rub.</p>\n<p>Hand-washing:<br />\n\u2022 Use warm running water<br />\n\u2022 Wet the hands before applying soap<br />\n\u2022 Ensure you create a good lather<br />\n\u2022 Follow the correct hand washing technique to ensure all areas are covered as shown below.<br />\n\u2022 Hand washing should take at least 15 seconds, but no longer than 3 minutesAll hand basins in surgeries and hospitals have instructions of how to wash hands correctly as below.<br />\n\u2022 Rinse well with the hands uppermost so that the water runs off the elbow<br />\n\u2022 Use a \u2018hands-free\u2019 (e.g. elbows) technique to turn off taps. Where \u2018hands free\u2019 tap<br />\nsystems are not in place, dry the hands first with paper towels and use these to turn off<br />\nthe taps<br />\n\u2022 Dry each part of the hands properly and dispose of paper towels in the appropriate waste<br />\nbin without re-contaminating your hands (e.g. use the foot pedal). Do not touch the bin lids</p>\n<p>Drying<br />\nEffective drying of the hands is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some debate over the most effective form of drying in washrooms. A growing volume of research suggests paper towels are much more hygienic than the electric hand dryers found in many washrooms.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/hand-washing.gif\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1907\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/hand-washing.gif?w=595&#038;h=876\" alt=\"hand washing\" width=\"595\" height=\"876\" /></a></p>\n<p>Removal of microorganisms from skin is enhanced by the addition of soaps or detergents to water.The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce barriers to solution, and increase solubility. Water is an inefficient skin cleanser because fats and proteins, which are components of organic soil, are not readily dissolved in water. Cleansing is, however, aided by a reasonable flow of water.</p>\n<p>Water temperature<br />\nHot water that is comfortable for washing hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria. Bacteria grows much faster at body temperature (37 C). However, warm, soapy water is more effective than cold, soapy water at removing the natural oils on your hands which hold soils and bacteria. Contrary to popular belief however, scientific studies have shown that using warm water has no effect on reducing the microbial load on hands.</p>\n<p>Solid soap<br />\nSolid soap, because of its reusable nature, may hold bacteria acquired from previous uses. Yet, it is unlikely that any bacteria are transferred to users of the soap, as the bacteria are rinsed off with the foam.</p>\n<p>Antibacterial soap<br />\nAntibacterial soaps have been heavily promoted to a health-conscious public. To date, there is no evidence that using recommended antiseptics or disinfectants selects for antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature. However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as Triclosan, which has an extensive list of resistant strains of organisms. So, even if antibiotic resistant strains aren&#8217;t selected for by antibacterial soaps, they might not be as effective as they are marketed to be.</p>\n<p>Besides this on entering a hospital and individual wards and now in GP surgeries there are facilities to use hand antiseptic and this also must be carried out on entry.</p>\n<p><strong>Hand antiseptic</strong><br />\nA hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a non-water-based hand hygiene agent. In the late 1990s and early part of the 21st century, alcohol rub non-water-based hand hygiene agents (also known as alcohol-based hand rubs, antiseptic hand rubs, or hand sanitizers) began to gain popularity.<br />\n<a href=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/image19.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1957\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/image19.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200\" alt=\"Handwashing\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a></p>\n<p>Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated together with a thickening agent such as Carbomer into a gel, or a humectant such as glycerin into a liquid, or foam for ease of use and to decrease the drying effect of the alcohol.</p>\n<p>Hand sanitizers containing a minimum of 60 to 95% alcohol are efficient germ killers. Alcohol rub sanitizers kill bacteria, multi-drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza,and hepatitis) and fungus. Alcohol rub sanitizers containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% of the bacteria on hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% of the bacteria on hands 1 minute after application.<br />\n<a href=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/image16.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1954 size-large\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/image16.jpg?w=876&#038;h=1024\" alt=\"Handwashing\"   /><br />\n</a><br />\nHand sanitizers are most effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses. <strong>Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost entirely ineffective against norovirus or Norwalk type viruses, the most common cause of contagious gastroenteritis.</strong><br />\n<a href=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/image20.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-1958\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/image20.jpg?w=150&#038;h=150\" alt=\"Handwashing\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 1908, "location": false, "date": "07-04-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Melanoma", "teledermatology", "Health", "Dermatologist", "Dermatoscope", "Ealing"], "text": "<p>Every surgery there will be several patients who will attend with a skin problem.

Applications comprise health care management such as diagnoses, consultation and treatment as well as (continuous) education. The dermatologists Perednia and Brown were the first to coin the term \u201cteledermatology\u201d in 1995.

It is also sometimes called \u2018epiluminoscopy\u2019 and \u2018epiluminescent microscopy\u2019. Dermoscopy is mainly used to evaluate pigmented lesions in order to distinguish malignant skin lesions, such as melanoma and pigmented basal cell carcinoma, from benign melanocytic naevi and seborrhoeic keratoses. Hence,with specialists trained in dermoscopy, there is considerable improvement in the sensitivity (detection of melanomas) as well as specificity (percentage of non-melanomas correctly diagnosed as benign), compared with naked eye examination. Astudy showed that the accuracy by dermatoscopy was increased up to 20% in the case of sensitivity and up to 10% in the case of specificity, compared with naked eye examination. By using dermatoscopy the specificity is thereby increased, reducing the frequency of unnecessary surgical excisions of benign lesions.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/image13.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1950\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/image13.jpg?w=200&#038;h=150\" alt=\"Dermoscope\" width=\"200\" height=\"150\" /></a></p>\n<p>We will now be referring patients to a community nurse-led clinic to perform Dermoscopy and then the photos of the images will be sent by email to be read by a Dermatologists in the same way X-rays are read by Radiologists.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1914\" style=\"width: 220px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/image51.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1914\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/image51.jpg?w=210&#038;h=300\" alt=\"Figure 5.

It is linked with higher levels of the stress hormone cortisol in the morning, which raises the risk of heart attacks and strokes.<br />\nLoneliness is also linked with higher blood pressure and a weakening of the immune system.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, researchers at the University of Chicago aimed to quantify the effect that loneliness had on the elderly&#8217;s wellbeing. Led by Professor John Cacioppo, their report, entitled Rewarding Social Connections Promote Successful Ageing, discovered that feeling lonely increased the risk of heart attacks, dementia, depression, and could disrupt sleep, raise blood pressure and lower the immune system. In short, loneliness is as bad for the health as that nasty 15-a-day Marlboro Light habit.<br />\nOne possible explanation for its link with ill-health is that loneliness seems to make people sleep less deeply. Lonely people tend to suffer from brief \u201cmicroawakenings\u201d in the night, which may reflect a nervousness about being alone at night, he said.<br />\nResearch found that your body&#8217;s inflammatory response to illness can be affected by loneliness.</p>\n<p>Last week, a survey by the Office for National Statistics found that Britain is the loneliest country in Europe in that people are less likely to have strong friendships or know their neighbours than inhabitants of any other country in the EU.</p>\n<p>Loneliness is a massive issue for people in later life in the UK.

Even just passing the time of day can be very meaningful to someone who lives alone.<br />\nWhen the medical students are assigned to the practise I often introduce them to patients who live alone and encourage the students to sit and listen to what these patients have to say. There have been many magical moments when I have watched the older person suddenly &#8216;come to life&#8217; as they relate tales of their earlier life. Moreover, I have observed the fascination of the young student as they listen.

You walk into a coffee shop and instead of buying just one cup of coffee, you buy two, or more. You buy one for yourself and one for someone in need.<br />\n*Second, it\u2019s direct. You do not need to worry if your money is going to actually help someone or just to take care of a charity organization and its overhead and expenses. You also do not need to worry whether or not your recipient will use your gift to buy alcohol or drugs. You can directly control which food or beverage you would like to donate.<br />\n*Third, it\u2019s win-win. You not only support a person in need, you also support your local business and all its employees. Your money does not go to another state, country or continent. It stays right in the neighborhood where it was spent.<br />\n*Lastly, it can be used for more than just coffee. You could buy a hot bowl of nourishing soup, a filling sandwich, water, fruit, bread, or a full meal. Suspended coffee\u2019s simplicity makes it easy to duplicate with other food items.</p>\n<p><strong>The history of suspended coffees</strong><br />\nWe entered a little coffeehouse with a friend of mine and gave our order. While we were approaching our table two people came in and went the counter. \u201cFive coffees, please. Two of them for us and three suspended.\u201d They paid for their order, took the two and left. I asked my friend: \u201cWhat are those \u2018suspended coffees?\u2019\u201d \u201cWait for it and you will see\u201d he answered. Some more people entered. The next order was for seven coffees and it was made by three lawyers \u2013 three for them and four \u201csuspended\u201d. While I still wondered what\u2019s the deal with those \u201csuspended\u201d coffees I enjoyed the summer weather and the beautiful view towards the square in front of the caf\u00e9. Suddenly a man dressed in shabby clothes who looked like a beggar came in through the door and kindly asked \u201cDo you have a suspended coffee?\u201d He got a coffee for free \u2013 no charge \u2013 he sat down and took a sip and a smile ran through his face. It\u2019s simple \u2013 people pay in advance for a coffee meant for someone who cannot afford a warm beverage. The tradition with the suspended coffees started in Naples, but it has spread all over the world and in some places you can order not only a suspended coffee, but also a sandwich or a whole meal.<br />\n<a href=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/image34.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1985\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/image34.jpg?w=300&#038;h=198\" alt=\"Suspended coffees\" width=\"300\" height=\"198\" /></a></p>\n<p>After reading about the above story, John Sweeney created the Facebook page Suspended Coffees.

He said that the sun would dry the starfish and they would die. I said to him that I thought he was foolish. There were thousands of starfish on miles and miles of beach. One man alone could never make a difference. He smiled as he picked up the next starfish.

Retired and semi-retired people come together and learn together, not for qualifications but for its own reward: the sheer joy of discovery!</p>\n<p>Members share their skills and life experiences: the learners teach and the teachers learn, and there is no distinction between them.</p>\n<p>A Brief History of the University of the Third Age (U3A)<br />\nU3A was founded in 1981 by three friends, all distinguished in their own field and embarking on the &#8220;third age&#8221; of their lives. Peter Lazlett, Eric Midwinter and Michael Young. They met in Cambridge to discuss the intellectual and cultural prospects for older people. France had already set up in 1972 their Universit\u00e9s du Troisieme Age and some Cambridge academics saw this as their model. Peter Lazlett made a visit to the continent and on his return pronounced the organisation admirable in its way but too elitist &#8211; Second Agers, mostly men, deciding what Third Agers should learn. The three friends knew that older people were perfectly capable of teaching each other. It is this mutual learning principle, forming a learning cooperative, which marks our organisation in the UK from other U3As around the world. The three set about getting the organisation off the ground.</p>\n<p>The U3A movement is supported by its national organisation, the Third Age Trust.</p>\n<p>Interest Groups are the heart of the U3A movement. Groups meet mainly in each other&#8217;s homes. Someone with particular expertise and knowledge takes on the role of teacher, leading each session. Alternatively, a member acts as secretary and helper with group members taking it in turn to lead a meeting. Groups generally meet fortnightly or monthly and everyone pays 20 pence a meeting to cover tea and coffee. If a class is full we have a waiting list and start a new group as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>To join a group, telephone the contact name on the programme sheet or approach them or a committee member at a Thursday meeting. If you cannot attend Thursday lectures you can still join a group, but must pay the membership subscription. Ealing U3A is always looking for new interest groups. If you would like to lead or suggest a group please contact a member of the committee.</p>\n<p>U3A is a worldwide movement which seeks to encourage older people to take part in educational and cultural activities and help them to teach and learn from each other in friendly and informal settings. U3A is also keen to include the housebound and the disabled in its educational and cultural activities. No qualifications are required to join &#8211; and no qualifications or degrees awarded. Members are encouraged to see the value and take pleasure in learning for its own sake.</p>\n<p><strong>EALING U3A</strong> &#8211; a co-operative of older people sharing educational, creative and leisure activities.

If you know an older person living alone and struggling to find motivation to get out, It may be very beneficial for them to visit with your pet. Ask them to pet-sit for you or see if they\u2019d be interested in fostering a homeless pet. The more people interact with pets, the more likely they are to interact with other humans and shrug off depression. I\u2019ve seen more than one case of a pet literally saving their owner\u2019s life, just by being there. Not infrequently I have started a consultation by asking about a patient&#8217;s pet usually by name and found that their whole demeanour changes. In one case a patient confided that it was his pet Guinea pig that saved him and even arrived with photos for me! Many people need a reason to get up in the morning, go for a walk, and visit the shop. Without a purpose, many older people fall into harmful patterns of behaviour that ultimately lead to depression, illness, or worse.

She was well informed and recognised that it was something her mother had come to realise was not an acceptable practise. However, she told me that her mother and her elder sister had had this done as it was considered an important ritual and a mother in Somali would be scorned upon if she did not arrange for it to be done and the girl would be derided by her peers. She was able to explain the different types of cutting and also was very cynical as to how it could be policed and people prosecuted for allowing it to be done.</p>\n<p>However, it was good to hear how she was not only well informed, not afraid to speak out about it and adamant it should be a practise to be abandoned. It is educated girls like this with determined personalities we rely upon to educate future generations and drive to abolish FGM.</p>\n<p>FGM is deeply embedded in local traditional belief systems for various reasons (Koso-Thomas 1987):</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/image4.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1932 size-large\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/image4.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=767\" alt=\"FGM\"   /></a></p>\n<p>\u2022 Faithfulness: to ensure that women are virgins at marriage and remain faithful to their husbands .</p>\n<p>\u2022 Chastity: to suppress female sexuality and to ensure chaste or monogamous behaviour (predominantly type 3, see below).</p>\n<p>\u2022 Amongst those who travel in herds as a protection against rape</p>\n<p>\u2022 Health: belief that it promotes cleanliness, improves fertility, and prevents both infant and maternal mortality.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Religion: some practicing communities believe that FGM is a religious obligation, but there is no doctrinal basis for FGM . It is not stated in the Koran or Bible.</p>\n<p>It is generally performed on girls aged between 4 and 12, although in some cultures it is practiced as early as a few days after birth; as late as just prior to marriage; during pregnancy or after the first birth. Girls may be cut alone, or with a group of peers from their community or village. The excisor can be a traditional birth attendant, a traditional practitioner or a health professional; typically, traditional elders (male barbers or female excisors) carry out the procedure, sometimes for pay. In some cases, it is not the remuneration but the prestige and power of the position that compels practitioners to continue. The practitioner may or may not have had health training, use anaesthesia, or sterilize the cutting instruments. Instruments used for the procedure include razor blades, glass, kitchen knives, sharp rocks, scissors, and scalpels.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/image2.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1930\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/image2.jpg?w=300&#038;h=106\" alt=\"fGM\" width=\"300\" height=\"106\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Female Genital Mutilation (FGM)</strong> &#8211; also known as Female Circumcision (FC) or Female Genital Cutting (FGC) &#8211; involves the cutting or alteration of the female genitalia for social, rather than medical, reasons ac defined by the World Health Organisation. The term FC was widely used for many years to describe the practice; however, it has been largely abandoned as it implies a false analogy with male circumcision though various communities still use the term as a literal translation of their own languages.</p>\n<p>FGM \u2018comprises all procedures involving partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other injury to the female organs, whether for cultural or other non therapeutic reasons\u2019.</p>\n<p>The practice ranges from a symbolic cut, to the removal of all or part of a girl\u2019s clitoris, to infibulation (sewing up the labia). Female Genital Mutilation or Cutting is therefore far more damaging and invasive than male circumcision.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, while male circumcision is seen as affirming manhood, FGM is often perceived primarily as a means to curtail premarital sex and preserve virginity.</p>\n<p>Immediate complications can include severe pain, shock, haemorrhage (bleeding), tetanus or sepsis (bacterial infection), urine retention, open sores in the genital region and injury to nearby genital tissue.</p>\n<p>Long term complications include:-</p>\n<p>*recurrent bladder and urinary tract infections;</p>\n<p>*cysts;</p>\n<p>*infertility;</p>\n<p>*an increased risk of childbirth complications and newborn deaths;</p>\n<p>*the need for later surgeries. For example, the FGM procedure that seals or narrows a vaginal opening (type 3 above) needs to be cut open later to allow for sexual intercourse and childbirth. Sometimes it is stitched again several times, including after childbirth, hence the woman goes through repeated opening and closing procedures, further increasing and repeated both immediate and long-term risks.</p>\n<p>There are an estimated 30 countries where FGM is traditional practice, and members of communities from those countries that have emigrated practice it in their new homelands. The practice is common in many parts of Africa (in at least 28 African countries), as well as in some Asian and Arab Countries. Certain immigrant communities in Europe, Australia, Canada and the United States also engage in it. Countries have tried to ban the practice, with mixed success:-</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/image.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1928 size-full\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/image.jpg?w=595&#038;h=332\" alt=\"\" width=\"595\" height=\"332\" /></a></p>\n<p>Unicef estimates that more than 125 million girls and women have undergone the practice and that 30 million girls are at risk of it over the coming decade. In addition to Egypt, where 91 percent of women 15 to 49 have undergone the practice, countries with the highest percentages of women who have been cut include Somalia, at 98 percent; Guinea, at 96 percent; Djibouti, at 93 percent; Eritrea and Mali, at 89 percent; and Sierra Leone and Sudan, at 88 percent. Almost one in five young girls in sub-Saharan Africa are forced to endure FGM.</p>\n<p><strong>20,000 girls in the UK are at risk of FGM every year</strong></p>\n<p>Although the practise of FGM remains persistent in several countries in Africa and the Middle East teenage girls are now less likely to have been cut than older women in more than half of the 29 countries in Africa and the Middle East where the practice is concentrated. In Egypt, for example, where more women have been cut than in any other nation, survey data showed that 81 percent of 15- to 19-year-olds had undergone the practice, compared with 96 percent of women in their late 40s. Only a third of teenage Egyptian girls who were surveyed thought it should continue, compared with almost two-thirds of older women. Thankfully the practice is more widespread than it is popular, giving some hope that it will decline even more in the future;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/image1.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1929 size-full\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/image1.jpg?w=595&#038;h=369\" alt=\"FGM\" width=\"595\" height=\"369\" /></a></p>\n<p>A simple MMS message alerted Dr Livingston and myself to be more sensitive about this condition and to be proactive in understanding those women who have had FGM and to be vigilant if we suspect this is being carried out.

The building, with 4 acres of gardens, had been bequeathed to the Central London Throat and Ear Hospital by the Hospital&#8217;s Vice-President and a friend of Florence Nightingale, Col. Sir John Smith Young, on the proviso that it be used as a convalescent home for the Hospital. A liberal endowment fund was also bequeathed for its maintenance. The Home had accommodation for 26 patients &#8211; 8 males, 10 females and 8 children.</p>\n<p>During WW2 the gardens provided vegetables for patients in the Home and its parent Hospital.</p>\n<p>By 1964 the building had become a geriatric hospital for the North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board, with 19 beds.</p>\n<p>By 1967 it had 12 beds.</p>\n<p>In 1976 it became a hostel for patients awaiting operation. It finally closed in 1977.</p>\n<p>As we know it today The Dame Gertrude Young House opened in 1984. Hestia also liaise closely with Ealing council.<br />\n<a href=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/image9.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-1942\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/image9.jpg?w=150&#038;h=48\" alt=\"image\" width=\"150\" height=\"48\" /></a>It is run by the St Mungo Community Trust (Hestia) and has accommodation for 20 vulnerable homeless men.<br />\n<strong>What is the St Mungo Trust ( Hestia)</strong><br />\nIn 1970 Jim Horne, a man who had personal experience of homelessness, started a soup run to help people living rough around the old Covent Garden Market.</p>\n<p>Later that year he founded the St Mungo Community Trust, and obtained the use of run-down houses at token rents, from the Greater London Council and local authorities, to provide shelter for men and women living on the streets. For nearly a decade the Trust pioneered work in this area, running the old Marmite factory in Vauxhall, the old Charing Cross hospital and other properties to provide as many as 800 people a night with accommodation. It was the dedication of the members of the Trust and of those who supported them which kept them going in conditions which would seem almost impossible today.</p>\n<p>When I arrived in 1997 I was warned that we should not register residents permanently and they should be always accompanied on their visits to the surgery and seen at separate times after surgery hours. I was horrified at the idea as I was committed to the ethos of the National Health which serves all people without discrimination and insisted from the outset that they should registered, given a new patient check in the same way as other patients and attend surgery with everyone else. I have to say with the sensitivity and support of the surgery staff there have been no significant problems. Admittedly on occasions when receptionists have noticed that one of them has been agitated or unwell they have gently lured them away , given them a cup of tea and discretely called one of us out if surgery to attend to them, which has sometimes alerted an observant waiting patient to become disgruntled at the thought of someone being taken out of turn. Although there was one occasion when I had been warned that one resident tended to get inpatient and ready to call him in without waiting for very long but when I went to call him in he exclaimed, &#8220;We are playing I-spy and it&#8217;s my turn&#8221;.<br />\nFor those that don&#8217;t know this game it is ideal to play as a family especially whilst waiting. (I-spy is a guessing game. One player chooses an object that is visible to all the players and says, &#8220;I spy with my little eye something beginning with &#8230;&#8221;, naming the letter the chosen object starts with (e.g. &#8220;I spy with my little eye something beginning with C&#8221; if the chosen object is a car). Other players have to guess the chosen object.)<br />\nAll of these patients have suffered serious mental illness, often rejected by their families and friends and as a consequence become homeless and subsequently are taken from the streets and often end up having long stay hospital admissions in some cases up to a year.</p>\n<p>As the years have gone by we have formed a more positive relationship with these residents and my feedback from the warden in charge is that they appreciate coming to the surgery and looking after them has become an important part of my work as GP. Over the years I have watched many of them &#8216;turn around&#8217; to lbe rehabilitated back into the community. The staff have an amazing gift of being able to patiently motivate them and guide them into feeling a part of a community and in some cases even helping them find employment and become independent. Working alongside these dedicated staff I have learnt so many different ways of getting alongside these men who can be challenging. The &#8216;knock on&#8217; effect is that I have used these skills to communicate and understand patients and their families who could be potentially as vulnerable.<br />\nIt is only in the past 3 years that it has been recognised that people with severe mental health have a life expectancy<br />\n10-15 years less than the rest of the population In a study looking at 30,000 patients they found that many were dying early from heart attack, stroke and cancer rather than suicide or violence. Is was stated in the press that<br />\n&#8216;Mental health groups say vulnerable people need to be offered better care to prevent premature deaths.&#8217;<br />\nNow the government have recommended that patients with severe mental illness should have general medical checks!</p>\n<p>More recently I have begun giving the residents talks on health issues and have taken medical students who have then chatted to them in small groups. The atmosphere has been positive and the questions interesting and they have asked me to give more talks which I hope to do in the coming months. Along with the staff we are encouraging healthy living particularly eating habits as many have living on fast food and living a poor lifestyle.<br />\nThe Round Table bought a greenhouse for them and they have started growing vegetables and I am hoping that any gardeners in Ealing will be able to donate plants or gardening items to encourage this venture.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/image7.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1939\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/image7.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300\" alt=\"Hestia\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<p>Thank you Sandra for letting me share this special occasion and to be associated with this wonderful organisation.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/image10.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-1944\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/image10.jpg?w=114&#038;h=150\" alt=\"image\"   /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 1935, "location": false, "date": "07-02-2014", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["lifestyle", "Osteoporosis", "Health", "elderly", "Falls"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image28.jpg\"><img src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image28.jpg?w=440&#038;h=210\" alt=\"image\" width=\"440\" height=\"210\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-220\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Falls Awareness Week, 2013</strong></div>\n<div><a href=\"//0\">17th \u00a0- 21st June</a></div>\n<div>Theme; Healthy Feet\u00a0</div>\n<div>\n<div>This week we were sitting in the sun having a nice cup of coffee and the phone rang. My husband answered and it was Burton Alan ( named after his birthplace to indicate which Alan) someone he had come across at the Builder&#8217;s \u00a0Merchant \u00a0when ordering gravel several years ago and they had kept in touch since. \u00a0He is now 74 years of age and a few years earlier he had bought some land and single- handedly started \u00a0building his own four bedroomed detached house ( having constructed a Wooden chalet to live in whilst it was being built). Considering he had been a Chemical Engineer specialising in water purification \u00a0this was no mean feat. He had made great progress, \u00a0the roof was completed and he was working on the \u00a0interior finishes (nearly finished in his mind but for me there seemed a lot to do).\u00a0</div>\n<div>Last month one evening he had gone Line Dancing \u00a0in the village hall. On leaving, the outer door of the Hall \u00a0had slammed back on him and he had fallen. He was helped up, got to the car and drove home. After a restless night he felt he should go to the local hospital as the leg was very painful and paracetamol was not working even with a tot of whiskey! When he got there he had fractured his hip and was admitted to have surgery to have the femur pinned.</div>\n<div>\u00a0This was why he had phoned as he was now home from hospital and the convalescent clinic after 3 weeks and needed a little job doing. When we had visited him soon after surgery he was not yet walking \u00a0but was sitting up in bed drawing his electrical diagrams so we weren&#8217;t surprised he was backing &#8216;home&#8217; in the chalet as he was anxious to get back to his \u00a0almost finished house. Now Alan is not the most organised and tidiest of people and when we arrived the land where \u00a0the house and chalet stood was a building site and by no means in any order pipes, equipment,plastic buckets etc strewn everywhere and to get to the chalet it was through this detritus and walking through long grass concealing even more hazards. His car was parked at the end of the path for him to use to go to the shop in the next village. As we walked along we cleared visible objects to one side and found him sitting on the veranda surrounded by paperwork, wires,tools various bits of furniture including a new sofa he had recently bought from someone at the Line Dancing group!! We sat down and over a cup of tea tried to talk about the practicalities of staying in this situation but as if he didn&#8217;t hear \u00a0he merely veered the subject back to how he could finish the house and was working out the amount of voltage the EDF ( electricity board) needed to supply to the house, taking into account the length of the cable and resistance in Ohms it would produce. ( a test on our knowledge of basic physics) The job he wanted my husband to do was to fill in a hole over a pipe in the path through the long grass leading to the house. After \u00a0we wandered around looking for a shovel, pick axe to loosen the hardened aggregate \u00a0and empty the wheelbarrow full of various tools my husband went off under his supervision to fill in the hole!!!</div>\n<div>During this time I tried to discuss other options and discuss falls prevention, probably best managed by staying with relatives. He said the physiotherapist had visited earlier and \u00a0he was puzzled as to \u00a0why the hospital physiotherapist had recommended walking as much as possible but this domiciliary physiotherapist had recommended doing static exercises and very little walking. No mention of falls assessment ! \u00a0We did our best to make sensible suggestions but his parting words were &#8216;thank you for coming over to do that I must take you out for a meal sometime and I&#8217;ll be in touch.</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div>I wrote this as an extreme example of how difficult it is to make people aware of hazards not only for themselves but for those around them. I remember when I used to take up the rugs in my mothers house knowing full well as soon as I turned my back she would put them down. Do all parents teach their children to put their toys away. A blind friend of mine was obsessional about counting toys in and out of the toy box and also told me her worst nightmare was walking down a street with black bags on the footpath as no way could she see them even the outline ( bear that in mind when you put your bags out)</div>\n<div>The irony of this tale is that Line Dancing is a good way of improving balance and strengthening leg muscles!\u00a0</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div>Hence, falls awareness is for everyone whatever the age and every parent should teach their children this from the word go. I am sure everyone has a tale to tell of a fall that should not have happened. \u00a0Do you put salt on the path outside your home \u00a0in icy weather? Do you put something to one side or away if it is in the way even if it is not your property or do you just step over it?Do you check your elderly or disabled relatives home for hazards and tactfully remove them? Many people especially in West London have low VitaminD and a high percentage of elderly people \u00a0have osteoporosis both conditions indicate a greater risk of fracture and delayed healing.\u00a0</div>\n<div>Sometimes it is difficult to change someone&#8217;s ways but it is worth a try, it may simply be replacing a light bulb, supplying a cordless phone, fitting grab rails in the bathroom \u00a0or taking away a mat or tidying an electric cable.\u00a0</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div>\n<div>Everyone can be at risk of having a fall, but older adults are more vulnerable than others. This is mainly due to long-term health conditions that can increase the chances of a fall.</div>\n<div>Other groups who are particularly at risk are young children and people whose job involves working at heights.</div>\n<div>Falls are a common but often overlooked source of injury and sometimes death. In 2009 in England and Wales, there were 3,593 deaths as a result of falls.</div>\n<div>Around 30% of adults who are over 65 and living at home will experience at least one fall a year. This rises to 50% of adults over 80 who are either at home or in residential care.</div>\n<div>Most falls do not result in serious injury. However, 20% of older adults will require medical attention for a fall and 5% will experience a serious injury, such as a broken bone.</div>\n<div>Falls can also have an adverse psychological impact on elderly people. For example, after having a fall a person can lose confidence, become withdrawn and may feel as if they have lost their independence.</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div>Falls and accidents seldom &#8220;just happen.&#8221; But there are many simple things that older people can do to prevent falls, and their potentially devastating consequences aswell as</div>\n<div>taking \u00a0care of your health by exercising and \u00a0 making sure that you get enough calcium and vitamin D.</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div>\n<div>How Can I Prevent Falling?</div>\n<div>At any age, people can make changes to lower their risk of falling.\u00a0</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div>Some tips to help prevent falls outdoors are:</div>\n<div>Use a walking stick</div>\n<div>Wear rubber-soled shoes so you don&#8217;t slip</div>\n<div>Walk on grass when pavements are uneven or slippery</div>\n<div>Put salt or kitty litter on icy paths</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div>Some ways to help prevent falls indoors are:</div>\n<div>Keep rooms free of clutter, especially on floors</div>\n<div>Wear low-heeled shoes</div>\n<div>Do not walk in socks, stockings, or slippers</div>\n<div>Be sure rugs have skid-proof backs or are tacked to the floor</div>\n<div>Be sure stairs are well lit and have rails on both sides</div>\n<div>Put grab bars on bathroom walls near bath, shower, and toilet</div>\n<div>Use a nonskid bath mat in the shower or bath</div>\n<div>Keep a torch \u00a0next to your bed</div>\n<div>Use a sturdy stepstool with a handrail and wide steps</div>\n<div>Add more lights in rooms</div>\n<div>Buy a cordless phone so that you don&#8217;t have to rush to the phone when it rings and so that you can call for help if you fall.</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div>You can also do exercises to improve your balance. While holding the back of a chair, sink, or counter:</div>\n<div>Stand on one leg at a time for a minute and then slowly increase the time.

After 2-3 days we counted 11 eggs and each day she sat on them carefully rolling them with her feet and only short breaks to eat. This she did diligently for 30days and then appeared 10 ducklings following her in line staggering and barely able to walk. After devouring the contents and ? shells of the eggs as the nest only showed the 11th half eaten egg they were being taken straight to the nearest water. </p>\n<p>Day by day mother duck has appeared with her young but sadly each day with one less duckling and now she has only 6&#8230;.<br />\nOn watching them all the ducklings have their own character the bold that leads the way the frail that struggles to follow the one that wants to cling to the mother the one that gets led on by the bold one or just wanders off  and those that simply confirm.

Most children with rotavirus infection do not need admission to hospital. About 1 child in 10 who has rotavirus infection needs to be admitted to hospital.</div>\n<div>Rotavirus is a viral infection that can cause gastroenteritis. Gastroenteritis is an infection of the gut (intestines) which usually causes symptoms of being sick (vomiting) and diarrhoea.\u00a0\u00a0In most cases the infection clears within a few days, but sometimes takes longer. The main risk is a lack of fluid in the body (dehydration) and so the main treatment is to give your child lots to drink. It mainly affects young children, especially children between the ages of 6 months and 2 years.</div>\n</div>\n<div>With vomiting and diarrhoea, there is a risk of your child becoming lacking in fluid in their body (dehydrated). You should consult a doctor quickly if you suspect that your child is becoming dehydrated. Mild dehydration is common and is usually easily and quickly treated by drinking lots of fluids. Severe dehydration can be fatal unless quickly treated because the organs of the body need a certain amount of fluid to work normally.</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div>\n<div>Symptoms of dehydration &#8211; associated with any cause of gastroenteritis</div>\n<div>In children symptoms include passing little urine, a dry mouth, a dry tongue and lips, fewer tears when crying, sunken eyes, weakness, being irritable or having no energy.</div>\n<div>Symptoms also include drowsiness, pale or mottled skin, cold hands or feet, very few wet nappies, and fast (but often shallow) breathing. This is a medical emergency and immediate medical attention.</div>\n</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div>\n<div>Fluids to prevent dehydration</div>\n<div>You should encourage your child to drink plenty. The aim is to prevent dehydration. The fluid lost in what they bring up (their vomit) and/or their diarrhoea needs to be replaced. Your child should continue with their normal diet and usual drinks. In addition, they should also be encouraged to drink extra fluids. However, avoid fruit juices or fizzy drinks, as these can make diarrhoea worse.</div>\n<div>If your child is mildly dehydrated, this may be treated by giving them rehydration drinks. Your doctor or nurse will advise about how to make up the drinks and about how much to give. This can depend on the age and the weight of your child. If you are breast-feeding, you should continue with this during this time. Otherwise, don&#8217;t give your child any other drinks unless the doctor or nurse has said that this is OK. It is important that your child is rehydrated before they have any solid food.</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div>Babies under 6 months old are at increased risk of dehydration. You should seek medical advice if they develop gastroenteritis. Breast or bottle feeds should be encouraged as normal. You may find that your baby&#8217;s demand for feeds increases. You may also be advised to give extra fluids (either water or rehydration drinks) in between feeds.</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div>Rehydration drinks may be advised by a healthcare professional for children not drinking enough or with severe diarrhoea and vomiting; especially if they have passed six or more very loose stools (faeces) or vomited three or more times in the previous 24 hours. They are made from sachets available from pharmacies and on prescription. You should be given instructions about how much to give. Rehydration drinks provide a perfect balance of water, salts, and sugar. The small amount of sugar and salt helps water to be absorbed better from the gut (intestines) into the body. Do not use home-made salt/sugar drinks, as the quantity of salt and sugar has to be exact.</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div>If your child vomits, wait 5-10 minutes and then start giving drinks again, but more slowly (for example, a spoonful every 2-3 minutes). Use of a syringe can help in younger children who may not be able to take sips.</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div>Note: if you suspect that your child is dehydrated, or is becoming dehydrated, you should seek medical advice urgently.</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div>Sometimes a child may need to be admitted to hospital for treatment if they are dehydrated. Treatment in hospital usually involves giving rehydration solution via a special tube called a nasogastric tube. This tube passes through your child&#8217;s nose, down their throat and directly into their stomach. An alternative treatment is with fluids given directly into a vein (intravenous fluids).</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div>Eat as normally as possible once any dehydration has been treated</div>\n<div>Correcting any dehydration is the first priority. However, if your child is not dehydrated (most cases), or once any dehydration has been corrected, then encourage your child to have their normal diet. Do not &#8216;starve&#8217; a child with rotavirus infection. This used to be advised but is now known to be wrong.\u00a0</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div>Breast-fed babies should continue to be breast-fed if they will take it. This will usually be in addition to extra rehydration drinks (described above).</div>\n<div>Bottle-fed babies should be fed with their normal full-strength feeds if they will take it. Again, this will usually be in addition to extra rehydration drinks (described above).</div>\n<div>Older children &#8211; offer them some food every now and then. However, if he or she does not want to eat, that is fine. Drinks are the most important, and food can wait until the appetite returns.</div>\n<div>Medication is not usually needed</div>\n<div>You should not give medicines to stop diarrhoea to children under 12 years old. They are unsafe to give to children, due to possible serious complications. However, you can give paracetamol or ibuprofen to ease a high temperature (fever) or headache.</div>\n</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div>How is rotavirus spread?</div>\n<div>Rotavirus is present in the gut (intestines) of an infected person and can pass out in their diarrhoea. It is easily spread from an infected person to another by close contact. This is often because the virus is on the infected person&#8217;s hands after they have been to the toilet. For smaller children who wear nappies, it may be spread by the hands of the person changing the infected child&#8217;s nappy. Surfaces or objects touched by the infected person can also allow the virus to spread. The virus can be passed on if the infected person prepares food. Outbreaks of rotavirus that affect many people can occur &#8211; for example, in nurseries or schools.</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div>NB Although this is advise in a case of Rotavirus \u00a0the same advice should be followed in all cases of gastroenteritis.\u00a0</div>\n", "post_id": 254, "location": false, "date": "06-10-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Health", "diabetes"], "text": "<p>This is a useful App for all diabetics</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/diabetes-manager/id649331720?mt=8\">Diabetes Manager by patient.co.uk</a><br />\nWe are keen for patients to take an interest in monitoring and understanding all aspects of their Diabetes.

The scent of freshly mown grass and the aroma of surrounding herbs with the steady hum drum sound of a nearby tractor confirmed the arrival of summer. The weather was perfect, the sky a glorious blue, the sun blazing brilliantly, the Golden Oriole singing gracefully as he leapt from tree to tree accompanied by two turtle doves squawking noisily whilst they chased each other playfully. This was amidst a chorus of feathered creatures chatting as the distant sound of the Cuckoo was beginning to change it&#8217;s tune before flying south. I felt that I was the nearest I could ever be to Paradise.!<br />\nThen the phone rang asking if I could come to lunch, which initially I thought was a good idea until my dear friend said &#8216;by the way we are having an informal discussion on &#8216;Euthanasia&#8217; and wondered if you could come along to give a more informed opinion.<br />\nWhen I was working full-time there was very little time to think deeply about such issues and now I was amongst people who felt this is something important to discuss as they were all in retirement and needing to think about end of life. What a day to choose!<br />\n&#8221; It will only be for about an hour and it will be good to see you&#8230;&#8230;..&#8221; I soon found myself driving through beautiful countryside past barley fields swaying in the gentle breeze as if dancing to a Strauss Viennese Waltz and the unmistakable russet coloured leaves of the walnut trees standing alone or in a grove bearing perhaps the healthiest nut in the World. The road followed several hamlets of stone terracotta roofed houses and wooded glades and finally I arrived at my destination .<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image58.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-347\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image58.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a><br />\nIn the quiet dining room about a dozen people gathered to discuss this topic &#8211; all post retirement and having experienced death an suffering of a near relative(s) and several had emailed their views to be shared.<br />\nIt was also announced on the day of this discussion that &#8220;The French Government are in the throes of tabling a draft legislation on euthanasia or as they want to refer it as &#8216;assisted death&#8217;. &#8221; so a very topical subject.<br />\nAn older gentleman, a retired naval officer opened the discussion by defining Euthanasia as a deliberate intervention specifically intended to end a person&#8217;s life for the purpose of relieving distress.<br />\nAnd went on to elaborate by referring to a reputable Ethics book (1)<br />\n<strong>Euthanasia</strong> can be classified in different ways, including:<br />\n<strong>active euthanasia</strong> \u2013 where a person deliberately intervenes to end someone\u2019s life, for example, by injecting them with sedatives<br />\n<strong>passive euthanasia</strong> \u2013 where a person causes death by withholding or withdrawing treatment that is necessary to maintain life, such as withholding antibiotics in someone with pneumonia<br />\n<strong>Euthanasia</strong> can also be classified as:<br />\n<strong>voluntary euthanasia</strong> \u2013 where a person makes a conscious decision to die and asks for help to do this<br />\n<strong>non-voluntary euthanasia</strong> \u2013 where a person is unable to give their consent (for example, because they are in a coma or are severely brain damaged) and another person takes the decision on their behalf, often because the ill person previously expressed a wish for their life to be ended in such circumstances<br />\n<strong>involuntary euthanasia</strong> \u2013 where a person is killed against their expressed wishes<br />\nDepending on the circumstances, voluntary and non-voluntary euthanasia could be regarded as either voluntary manslaughter (where someone kills another person but circumstances can partly justify their actions) or murder.<br />\nInvoluntary euthanasia is almost always regarded as murder.<br />\nHe reminded us that both euthanasia and assisted suicide are illegal under English and French law.<br />\nDepending on the circumstances, euthanasia is regarded as either manslaughter or murder and is punishable by law with a maximum penalty of up to life imprisonment.<br />\nAssisted suicide is illegal under the terms of the Suicide Act (1961) and is punishable by up to 14 years&#8217; imprisonment. Attempting to commit suicide is not a criminal act in itself.<br />\nHowever, Active euthanasia is currently legal in Belgium, Holland and Luxembourg. Under the laws in these countries, a person\u2019s life may be deliberately ended by their doctor or other healthcare professional.<br />\nThe person is usually given an overdose of muscle relaxants or sedatives. This causes a coma and then death.<br />\nHowever, euthanasia is only legal:<br />\n*if that person has made an active and voluntary request to end their life, and<br />\n*it is thought they have sufficient mental capacity to make an informed decision regarding their care, and<br />\n*it is agreed that the person is suffering unbearably and there is no prospect for an improvement in their condition<br />\n*Capacity is the ability to use and understand information to make a decision.</p>\n<p>In some countries the law is less clear, and some forms of assisted suicide and passive euthanasia are legal but active euthanasia is illegal.<br />\nFor example, some types of assisted suicide and passive euthanasia are legal in Switzerland, Germany, Mexico and the American state of Oregon.</p>\n<p>During the discussion aswell as reading on the subject it appears that there is widespread revulsion at the medicalisation of death and there is a growing fear of long,lingering death . Attempts are made to keep people with irreparable bodies alive by &#8216;high-tech&#8217; machinery and radical medical treatment when there is no reasonable expectation of returning to normal life for what remains of the &#8216;person&#8217;<br />\nThe Times (24 January 2007) reported that, according to the 2007 British Social Attitudes survey, 80% of the public said they wanted the law changed to give terminally ill patients the right to die with a doctor&#8217;s help.<br />\nHowever, this is where the disease is incurable and the person concerned is in coma or on a life support machine or there is significant intractable pain and suffering but at the other end of the spectrum where someone is not ill or close to death but -for example maybe extreme lonely and no longer enjoys life the pro-euthanasia is 12%.<br />\nNowadays, experience of death has changed and suffering is not considered part of human life and expectations are such that there is a demand for a swift and painless, tidily controlled death. Many people desire to keep control and dread losing it. Although despite the Hospice movement and greater expertise in dealing with palliative care there are still those who resist a move towards dependency and loss of self-determination.<br />\nAll major religions spring from a deep sense of the sanctity of life. It is believed that human life is a very great gift from God ,to be revered ,cherished,and protected from beginning to end .To destroy life is to dishonour the Giver of Life.<br />\nBut conversely pro euthanasia groups feel that people have an explicit right to die.<br />\nA separate right to die is not necessary, because our other human rights imply the right to die.<br />\nDeath is a private matter and if there is no harm to others, the state and other people have no right to interfere (a libertarian argument)<br />\nPractical arguments It is possible to regulate euthanasia-<br />\nAllowing people to die may free up scarce health resources (this is a possible argument, but no authority has seriously proposed it)<br />\nEuthanasia happens anyway (a utilitarian or consequentialist argument)<br />\nPhilosophical arguments<br />\nEuthanasia satisfies the criterion that moral rules must be universal<br />\nRegulating euthanasia<br />\nThose in favour of euthanasia think that there is no reason why euthanasia can&#8217;t be controlled by proper regulation, but they acknowledge that some problems will remain.<br />\nFor example, it will be difficult to deal with people who want to implement euthanasia for selfish reasons or pressurise vulnerable patients into dying.<br />\nThis is little different from the position with any crime. The law prohibits theft, but that doesn&#8217;t stop bad people stealing things.<br />\nThe group were not so concerned about whether they agreed with euthanasia it was more their concerns about how it was done and the act is open to abuse.<br />\nUnfortunately, the murder trial of Dr Harold Shipman,who by all accounts was a charming doctor has drawn attention to the enormity of trust which patients have held in their doctors for thousands of years.<br />\nAs doctors we all take the <strong>Hippocratic Oath</strong> (2) albeit usually the modern version and this is quite clear what direction we must follow and often people are unaware of our formal commitment.<br />\nA 12th Century Byzantine Manuscript of the Oath</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_348\" style=\"width: 95px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image59.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-348\" alt=\"    &quot; I will use treatments for the benefit of the ill in accordance with my ability and my judgment, but from what is to their harm and injustice I will keep them &quot; Hippocratic Oath \" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image59.jpg?w=85&#038;h=120\" width=\"85\" height=\"120\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><br />&#8221; I will use treatments for the benefit of the ill in accordance with my ability and my judgment, but from what is to their harm and injustice I will keep them &#8220;<br />Hippocratic Oath</p></div>\n<p>Hippocratic Oath-classic version-<br />\nI will neither give a deadly drug to anybody who asked for it, nor will I make a suggestion to this effect.

We have all been horrified by the avoidable deaths that have been in the news especially those reported at the Mid &#8211; Staffordshire NHS trust.<br />\nThis inevitably stirs up a desire to have control over end of life to avoid neglect.<br />\nThe NHS is moving towards more accountability and GP&#8217;s are piloting ways of actively working with patients and their families by advanced planning to have wishes and actions on record so that there is some broad outline of how end of life is to be managed.<br />\nThe concerns of the Liverpool Care Pathway was raised I feel that this it would be useful to explain what this is and how it came about:-</p>\n<p><strong>The Liverpool Care Pathway (LCP)</strong><br />\nLCP, developed by the RoyalLiver\u00adpool University Hospital and The Marie Curie Hospice in Liverpool, grew out of the hospice movement in the 1990s.<br />\nThe aim was to spread good, skilled care in the last few days and hours of a patient\u2019s life into other healthcare settings, such as hospitals and care homes, where there was evidence to suggest end-of-life care was poor.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image60.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-350\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image60.jpg?w=250&#038;h=87\" width=\"250\" height=\"87\" /></a></p>\n<p>It had been noted that as a patient was noted to be terminally ill and active intervention was scaled down the end of life care was left to junior doctors and nursing assistants. I clearly recall this when I was a junior doctor and I remember how some of these dying patients took me underwing to tell me what it was like to be dying and what they wanted and I shall be ever grateful to them but this is not an appropriate way to learn: we had to &#8216;learn on the hoof&#8217;<br />\nIt was often found that symptoms were inadequately controlled, oral hygiene often neglected, thirst remained unquenched and psychosocial needs were ignored.<br />\nLooking after a dying patient is challenging. To do it well involves confronting human mortality and accepting death as a normal part of life and therefore is an important part of medical care (which cannot always be curative).<br />\nComplicated factors are at play, including the existential worries many of us have about death, a sense of failure (and, increasingly, fears of litigation for not doing enough), and the unhappiness we anticipate among those left behind.<br />\nThe benefits of the LCP soon became apparent because it offered a simple framework tool that even the least experienced could follow to institute consistent care.<br />\nIn the hectic, understaffed modern medical world, the LCP ensures the patient is never left for too long. Continuing assessments in four domains (physical, psychological, social and<br />\nspiritual) every two hours mean symptoms are regularly considered.<br />\nThe LCP also provides a scheme for drugs to manage problems such as pain or terminal agitation. Unnecessary drugs can be stopped, but there is no hard and fast rule \u2013 the LCP is best used in an advisory, rather than a didactic, way and any treatments deemed<br />\nof value can continue to be given. The focus is on comfort and symptom control.</p>\n<p><strong>The LCP was clear from the start that it is not an active step to end life.</strong></p>\n<p>Although people die after an average of 29 hours on the pathway, the door is never closed to further intervention, and as a result of regular assessment, some patients are taken off the LCP because they improve. (The small number of patients I have seen taken off the LCP have all gone on to die within a few days.)</p>\n<p>Hence, in practise a patient is put on the LCP if it is deemed that they seem to have only 48hours to live but if they survive they are taken off it and observed and may be put back on if appropriate but this is all done under close supervision with advise and input from senior staff. It appears that the problem arises when communication fails and the professionals consider a patient having 48hrs to live without a concluding test just simply by experience and the attending relatives don&#8217;t understand the patient is dying. Hence, it is very important to communicate with relatives and address their views and concerns. In my experience I have had to hold many a family conference at all times of day and night and it is only when all grievances ,worries and fears are addressed that the end of life can be effectively managed.</p>\n<p>Another, big anxiety that people have was that euthanasia would be open to abuse especially from relatives and it is therefore not surprising that The Times (24 January 2007) reported that, according to the 2007 British Social Attitudes survey, 45% supported giving patients with non-terminal illnesses the option of euthanasia. &#8220;A majority&#8221; was opposed to relatives being involved in a patient&#8217;s death.</p>\n<p>Lack of oral intake is one of the things that particularly disturbs families and this was raised in discussion. The need for fluid is such a basic human drive that even medical staff tend to feel troubled when someone has not taken fluid for days, and better guidance is needed regarding assisted hydration and the use of other interventions.<br />\nResearch confirms my own experience that at the end of life, people may survive for many days without fluids and without significant discomfort, but this fact is little appreciated.<br />\nA survey of patients in Oregon hospice programmes found that as many as 15% of those who chose to discontinue food and fluids survived for more than two weeks, but reported high degree of peace and comfort..<br />\nI explained to the group who were not aware of how many doctors work with a palliative care team who holistically look at the circumstances and management of the end of life and that this is not just for cancer but can be any end of life illness including end-stage dementia, heart,kidney, liver failure end -stage neurological conditions including strokes, multiple sclerosis and motor neurone disease and many other diseases at any age. This challenging work is for the most part done by very dedicated health professionals based at local Hospices and who work with GP&#8217;s. I have witnessed many deaths which have been &#8216;quiet and peaceful&#8217; but not involving deliberate actions. All GP&#8217;s in England have a Palliative Care register and we are contracted to discuss these patients holistically every 3 months and more often if appropriate .<br />\nAt present in Britain, the Hospice approach, with its sensitivity to the many dimensions of human distress is gaining ground in all areas of health care so that euthanasia is not gaining further momentum. (3)Cicely Saunders, by inspiring world-wide enthusiasm for hospice philosophy ,has done more than any single individual to provide a positive alternative to euthanasia.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image61.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-352\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image61.jpg?w=300&#038;h=94\" width=\"300\" height=\"94\" /></a><br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image62.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-353\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image62.jpg?w=300&#038;h=63\" width=\"300\" height=\"63\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.meadowhousehospice.org.uk/faq.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.meadowhousehospice.org.uk/faq.php</a></p>\n<p>The group generally felt that what they wanted was a quiet and peaceful death in the lines of palliative care and if possible to be part of the process but were not in agreement to support active/deliberate terminal intervention.

There are more than 1,000 species. Barnacles attach themselves permanently to ships, wharves, and rocks, and to other marine animals.(look at mussel shells on the fish counter) Barnacles on the hull of a ship increase friction and can reduce the vessel&#8217;s speed<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image43.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-294\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image43.jpg?w=300&#038;h=248\" width=\"300\" height=\"248\" /></a></p>\n<p>If you clean a ship or put a new ship to sea, it\u2019s coated with microbes within a day,\u201d said Van Mooy. \u201cNot enough to see, but the first microbes are starting to lie down. And then the slime begins to grow over the course of weeks. That is essentially a gateway community to the barnacles and other things.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe slime\u201d is a biofilm, a thin sheet of bacteria that stick to each other and to a matrix of molecules they exude to communicate with each other and to provide a hospitable environment for themselves. Once the slime forms, the rush is on, as algae and the larvae of creatures such as barnacles attach and begin to grow over the course of weeks.

I do recall many years ago discovering that if I prescribed a course of antibiotics it was frequently sold or given to family,friends or contacts. I am aware that this still goes on despite constant reminders to patients.<br />\nDoctors have been criticised for prescribing antibiotics for viral infections.<br />\nI along with my GP colleagues are aware that if we refuse antibiotics for a viral infection that our patients are attending walk-in centres, going to A&amp;E when getting the antibiotics they want, which then sends them back to us the next morning. What a waste of resources, with each out-of-hours attendance for a self-limiting viral illness attracting a fee to the NHS.<br />\nWe know that if we prescribe antibiotics unnecessarily and especially if the patients fail to complete the course that there we will be nothing available for post operative infections<br />\nEg.in the near future it may be too risky to carry out a hip replacement as implanted materials, like those found in a joint replacement, can allow infections to persist. Our immune system is unable to attack bacteria that live on these implants, and these infections can become serious problems. If an infection of an implant goes untreated, the problem can worsen, and the bacteria can gain such a foothold that they can become a systemic problem and potentially fatal. However, implanted materials, like those found in a joint replacement, can allow infections to persist.<br />\nWe have been aware of superbugs such as MRSA for some time and the horrors of what happens if someone contracts an overwhelming infection with this bug.<br />\nThere were almost 43,000 patients who caught so called \u201csuperbugs\u201d in NHS hospitals last year.<br />\nIt has now become such a concern that it was brought up at the G8 conference as a serious global problem.<br />\nDavid Willetts, the British science minister who led the meeting this week, said the soaring levels of antibiotic resistant infections was now one of the greatest threats facing the world.<br />\nDoctors must think not once but twice before prescribing antibiotics and patients must think not once but twice before demanding antibiotics and always where possible to complete the course and do not give to anyone else.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image45.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-299\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image45.jpg?w=313&#038;h=161\" width=\"313\" height=\"161\" /></a></p>\n<p>Posted by Dr Bayer</p>\n", "post_id": 290, "location": false, "date": "06-15-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Food", "ARMD", "Heart disease", "TCM", "health benefits"], "text": "<p><strong>Apricots</strong><br />\n<strong> Ti\u00e1n X\u00ecng R\u00e9n</strong><br />\n<strong> \u751c\u674f\u4ec1</strong><br />\nThe apricot, Prunus armeniaca, is a species of Prunus, classified with the plum in the subgenus Prunus. The native range is somewhat uncertain due to its extensive prehistoric cultivation. Apricots are originally from China but arrived in Europe via Armenia, which is why the scientific name is Prunus armeniaca<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image46.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-302\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image46.jpg?w=640&#038;h=483\" width=\"640\" height=\"483\" /></a></p>\n<p>This week the apricots arrived in the market and as I arrived at the usual stall, the middle-aged stall-holder with a deep voice muttered audibly a string of words that I had not since I was a teenager on an exchange in France. She weighed out 2kg taking out a handful as she took them from the scales and putting a few back to look generous (I smiled as it was a trick I was taught when I worked for Elsie at the greengrocers as a teenager!) I was going to eat some fresh and to dehydrate some to use as snacks and in stews(tajines) desserts and maybe consider making jam to have with a morning croissant.<br />\nSummer has definitely arrived the stalls are laden with strawberries and now the apricots have arrived. Apricots are those beautifully golden orange coloured fruits with velvety skin and flesh, not too juicy but definitely smooth and sweet. Some describe their flavour as almost musky, with a faint tartness that lies somewhere between a peach and a plum.<br />\nThe high beta-carotene content of apricots makes them important heart health foods. Beta-carotene helps protect LDL cholesterol from oxidation, which may help prevent heart disease.<br />\nApricots contain nutrients such as vitamin A that promote good vision. Vitamin A, a powerful antioxidant, quenches free radical damage to cells and tissues. Free radical damage can injure the eyes&#8217; lenses.<br />\nAs a child, I remember being told to eat carrots so that you could see in the dark but as an adult, it looks like fruit is even more important for keeping your sight. Data reported in a study published in the Archives of Opthamology indicates that eating 3 or more servings of fruit per day may lower your risk of age-related macular degeneration (ARMD), the primary cause of vision loss in older adults, by 36%, compared to persons who consume less than 1.5 servings of fruit daily<br />\nIn this study, which involved over 100,000 women and men, researchers evaluated theeffect of study participants&#8217; consumption of fruits; vegetables; the antioxidant vitamins A, C, and E; and carotenoids on the development of early ARMD or neovascular ARMD, a more severe form of the illness associated with vision loss. Food intake information was collected periodically for up to 18 years for women and 12 years for men.<br />\nWhile, surprisingly, intakes of vegetables, antioxidant vitamins and carotenoids were not strongly related to incidence of either form of ARMD, fruit intake was definitely protective against the severe form of this vision-destroying disease.<br />\nWhen I am making jam or making a dessert using fresh apricots I always crack a few of the stones to add the seeds as my mother did.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image47.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-303\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image47.jpg?w=640&#038;h=428\" width=\"640\" height=\"428\" /></a></p>\n<p>Having completed my Diploma in Chinese Herbs I recall learning about the apricot kernel/seed Xing Ren which is used for a cough with yellow sputum, low grade fever and sore eyes associated with the common cold but it is only used in small quantities as it is toxic in large amounts(must be avoided in children and pregnant or breast feeding women) and usually used as part of a mixture of herbs (Sang Yu Jin)<br />\nIt also has anti-bacterial properties and in Chinese terms it expels the wind / heat invading the lung from the exterior (ie treats a cough caused by a virus or bacteria but mild with no systemic affects including high fever)<br />\nXing Ren stops the cough by directing the lung Qi downwards.<br />\nMy experience of prescribing this formula has shown it to effective in treating upper respiratory tract symptoms but it must be obtained from a reputable Chinese pharmacy.<br />\nThere have been claims the seeds can be used in anti-cancer treatment.<br />\nApricot seeds contain amygdalin, Vitamin B17 a naturally-occurring substance found mainly in the kernels of apricots, peaches, and almonds. Amygdalin is promoted as a cancer treatment by alternative physicians but there has been insufficient evidence to use it for treatment and no more than 2 seeds/day should be consumed as more could be seriously toxic.</p>\n<p>Posted by Dr Bayer</p>\n", "post_id": 301, "location": false, "date": "06-16-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Race of life", "lifestyle", "exercise", "cancer", "health benefits"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/016276.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-87\" alt=\"016276\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/016276.png?w=108&#038;h=42\" width=\"108\" height=\"42\" /></a>From the gallant Warriers</p>\n<p>THANK YOU SO MUCH to the those who sponsored us so generously for the Race for Life!

But I was now in a position where I had to try to prevent these people going down that route&#8230;.<br />\nYears have passed and my personal life has had many challenges and my understanding of depression has changed beyond measure- I now understand what it is like to feel in despair, hopeless and is life worth living? Fortunately I have been blessed with good friends, understanding people nearby, a strong faith and plenty of things I have been able to turn to to give me hope and worth and purpose to continue living.<br />\nWhen I was away someone emailed me and said &#8220;why don&#8217;t you do a blog on depression as there is lots in the news at the moment regarding bi polar (in view of Stephen fry\u2019s recent admissions of suicide attempt) and depression / suicide (Paris jackson attempt suicide yesterday and famous Bollywood movie start Jiah Khan committed suicide this week too due to depression)http://www.thecalmzone.net/2013/06/first-person-jiah-khan-depression-suicide/</p>\n<p>I felt that heart sink feeling again but a need to let people who are despairing that there is somewhere there for you and you have a right to be in this world and part of this world as much as anyone else.

(despite my father telling her she should claim her money back after all the years she had attended) an aerobic class, until well into her late eighties despite having arthritis. My father an ex-sailor enjoyed all water activities and actively encouraged us as well as helping  with the local naval cadets which included young people who came from less advantageous backgrounds and this certainly kept some of them out of trouble. My grandfather was an amputee and he cycled to work daily on a bicycle and loved swimming.</p>\n<p>This was a great example to their three children and we all followed her example by being involved in regular exercise in the same way and I am glad to say that their grandchildren are doing the same sort of exercise today-walking, swimming, gardening  with the added  yoga and cycling. </p>\n<p>I am sure that many other families can say the same and on reflection this is such an important responsibility of a parent to set that example.</p>\n<p>The recommended amount of exercise as suggested by the Chief Medical Officer is two-and-a-half hours a week of moderate physical  activity each week.<br />\nSadly,  researchers suggest that almost half of us and not doing enough and moreover a quarter of us walk for less than nine minutes, or under an average of one hour a week &#8211; and that include walking to the car, to work or to the shops.</p>\n<p>It is now established that there are probably about an estimated 12 million people in the UK who  have hypertension  and they are more likely to develop cardiovascular disease. This can be reduced by treating the hypertension and reducing lifestyle risks.</p>\n<p>A key  lifestyle intervention is increasing physical activity in those who are not active at present.</p>\n<p>As healthcare professionals we are recommended to discuss diet and exercise with people with hypertension as both a healthy diet and exercise can reduce blood pressure. We will now be using GPPAQ  which is a questionnaire which has been approved as a screening tool in primary care for patients aged 16-75yrs to assess activity level.  All patients with less than &#8216;Active&#8217; score will be offered  some support to increase activity and followed up after 6 months.</p>\n<p>We will also be actively screening all patients on our list of 40 yrs or over for hypertension and every 5 years. General health checks will also be offered. </p>\n<p>Recent research at Edinburgh University suggests sunlight helps reduce blood pressure as UV light release a compound which reduces blood pressure and benefits of sunlight far outweigh the risk of skin cancer. Hence, outdoor activity is even more beneficial!</p>\n<p>Patients have shared their ideas and activities with me for me to share with you&#8230;.</p>\n<p>Do you enjoy gardening?

However, it has a number of problems in urban use, most notably the short, stiff hairs shed by the young leaves and the dispersing seeds; these are an irritant if breathed in, and can exacerbate breathing difficulties for people with asthma and hay fever. The large leaves can create a disposal problem in cities. These leaves are tough and sometimes can take more than one year to break down if they remain whole.</div>\n<p>At the moment the trees especially the limes aswell as grass are showering their pollen and causing havoc in Ealing but for sufferers the rain may come to give some respite.

The higher the count the more severe symptoms of hay fever can become (depending on the specific type of pollen you are allergic to).<br />\nThe Met Office provides a pollen forecast.

It also seems that these times are extending now as we feel the effects of global warming and the changing weather patterns.<br />\n<strong>Who is affected?</strong><br />\nHay fever is one of the most common allergic conditions. It is estimated that there are more than 10 million people with hay fever in England.<br />\nHay fever usually begins in childhood or during the teenage years, but you can get it at any age.<br />\nThe condition is more common in boys than in girls. In adults, men and women are equally affected.<br />\nHay fever is more likely if there is a family history of allergies, particularly asthma or eczema.<br />\nClassical allergic salute &#8211; horizontal creasing of the nose secondary to persistent itching and rubbing: this is a sure sign of allergy in the nose<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image82.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-405\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image82.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a><br />\n<strong>Symptoms of hay fever</strong><br />\nSudden sneezing<br />\nYour nose will probably be very watery, runny and you feel congested<br />\nIrritation and itchy eyes, soon turning watery<br />\nOnset off uncontrollable sneezing<br />\nYou may well feel itchy in the mouth, nose and throat areas<br />\nA loss of smell and food may taste different<br />\nYour face may well feel swollen too<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image83.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-406\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image83.jpg?w=468&#038;h=311\" width=\"468\" height=\"311\" /></a><br />\n<strong>Self help tips</strong><br />\nIt is sometimes possible to prevent the symptoms of hay fever by taking some basic precautions, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li>wearing wraparound sunglasses to stop pollen getting in your eyes when you are outdoors</li>\n<li>change your clothes and take a shower after being outdoors to remove the pollen on your body</li>\n<li>try to stay indoors when the pollen count is high (over 50).</li>\n<li>Avoid cutting grass, playing or walking in grassy areas, and camping.</li>\n<li>Try to stay indoors when the pollen count is high (over 50).</li>\n<li>Keep windows and doors shut in the house. If it gets too warm, draw the curtains to keep out the sun and keep the temperature down.</li>\n<li>Don&#8217;t keep fresh flowers in the house.</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image84.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-407\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image84.jpg?w=640&#038;h=190\" width=\"640\" height=\"190\" /></a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Vacuum regularly, ideally using a machine with a HEPA (high-efficiency particle arresting) filter.</li>\n<li>Damp dust regularly. Dusting with a wet cloth, rather than a dry one, will collect the dust and stop any pollen from being spread around.</li>\n<li>Keep pets out of the house during the hay fever season. If your pet does come indoors, wash them regularly to remove any pollen from their fur.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Don&#8217;t smoke or let other people smoke in your house. Smoking and breathing in other people&#8217;s smoke will irritate the lining of your nose, eyes, throat and airways, and can make your symptoms worse.</li>\n<li>Keep car windows closed. You can buy a pollen filter for the air vents in your car. This will need to be changed every time the car is serviced.</li>\n<li>Rub a small amount of Vaseline inside your lower nostrils. This can help prevent pollen from entering your nasal passages.</li>\n<li>If possible, avoid drying clothes outside.

She was letting us know that she had woken in the night to a strange sound and following attempts at resuscitation by herself and the ambulance crew he had died suddenly. He was a handsome,highly intelligent,charming doctor/dentist/medical director of a pharmoceutical company who had been negotiating with NICE to accept Aricept as a treatment for Dementia.He had also been training for his 7th full marathon which he had taken part in and raised thousands of pounds for leukaemia following the death of his son&#8217;s best friend at the age of five.It was unbelievable and a total shock to all such a loss of someone so special. The night before he had been listening to opera with friends singing along with gusto and passion as he was also a musician, a pianist with talent.The funeral was an amazing musical tribute and those who spoke talked about his life with humour and sadness. Afterwards, his friends and colleagues commented that he had seemed the healthiest of everybody and as we chatted agreed it would have been a great party but it lacked one person. He was an ordinary East End lad made good commonly known as &#8216;Paul boy&#8217;! His only fault was that he was a Tottenham supporter which meant many an Saturday afternoon or a Boxing Day was spent in raucous banter whilst &#8216;the lads&#8217; watched their rivals play &#8211; nothing more exciting than a London Derby!<br />\nThis was an adult sudden cardiac death (SCD)as there was no evidence of disease on examination of his body after death and it was presumed death was due to sudden cardiac arrest,when the heart abruptly and without warning stops pumping.<br />\nIronically, the week after he died the drug was passed!</p>\n<p>I was reminded of this when a young attractive 25year old lady attended surgery recently devastated as she had lost her young partner in the same way. This young man had died suddenly without warning and his young partner and family had been left devastated.<br />\nShe then told me that his mother had become very keen to support the charity CRY was founded in 1995 to raise awareness of conditions that can lead to young sudden cardiac death (YSCD); sudden death syndrome (SDS); SADS. She was also taking part in the CRY Heart of London Bridges Walk 2013 on 7th July. There main reason for supporting this charity is that it funds screening of anyone who could considered at risk as shown on the link. What a brave lady, the love she had for this man was tangible and this family had also lost someone very special whose life had just begun. The family are keen to support this charity as it raises money to screen anyone at risk and support research projects aswell as support bereft families.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image89.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-428\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image89.jpg?w=550&#038;h=99\" width=\"550\" height=\"99\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.c-r-y.org.uk/general_information_on_cardiac_s.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.c-r-y.org.uk/general_information_on_cardiac_s.htm</a></p>\n<p>CRY holds ECG screening clinics for those aged 14 to 35 at a number of established locations around the UK including Belfast, Cardiff, Colchester and London.The CRY mobile screening unit facilitates various screening events at other locations in the UK &#8211; often organised by CRY supporters.

It is responsible for half of all heart disease deaths.<br />\nSudden cardiac death occurs when the heart\u2019s electrical system malfunctions. It is not a heart attack (also known as a myocardial infarcation). A heart attack is when a blockage in a blood vessel interrupts the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the heart, causing heart muscle to die. So if the heart can be compared to a house, SCD occurs when there is an electrical problem and a heart attack when there is a plumbing problem.<br />\nThe most common cause of cardiac arrest is a heart rhythm disorder or arrhythmia called ventricular fibrillation (VF). The heart has a built-in electrical system. In a healthy heart, the sinoatrial node, the heart\u2019s natural \u201cpacemaker\u201d triggers the heartbeat, then electrical impulses run along pathways in the heart, causing it to contract in a regular,rhythmic way. When a contraction happens, blood is pumped.<br />\nBut in ventricular fibrillation, the electrical signals that control the pumping of the heart suddenly become rapid and chaotic. As a result, the lower chambers of the heart, the ventricles, quiver or fibrillate instead of contracting, and they can no longer pump blood from the heart to the rest of the body. If blood cannot flow to the brain, the brain becomes starved of oxygen, and the person loses consciousness in seconds. Unless an emergency shock is delivered to the heart to restore its regular rhythm using a machine called a defibrillator, death occurs within minutes. It\u2019s estimated that more than 70 percent of ventricular fibrillation victims die before reaching the hospital.<br />\nWhen CPR and an AED (automated external defibrillator) are used together, the chance of survival following a cardiac arrest goes up to 50%, a ten-fold increase over CPR alone.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image90.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-430\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image90.jpg?w=227&#038;h=182\" width=\"227\" height=\"182\" /></a></p>\n<p>This is why you may see <strong>Automated External Defibrillator (AED)</strong> machines are being hung on walls in supermarkets or other public places. I have frequently seen them in French supermarkets and hyper stores.<br />\nIt is amazing that the nearest limited access AED is in Twickenham in a fitness club and the nearest 24 hr public access AED machine is outside an accountants office.

It is through these events that there have been major breakthroughs in screening and prevention of sudden death.Research in the channelopathies and cardiomyopathies is progressing rapidly and in the future it is expected that the majority of the genes involved will be discovered.<br />\nIn the future, it may also be possible to diagnose all carriers easily &#8211; even in those people who have a normal ECG reading. It may also be possible to choose the best treatment based on the type of mutations involved, and the treatment may even be designed based on this knowledge.<br />\nIn the meantime, better understanding of these conditions and improvements in methods for diagnosis should still result in better management. It is crucial that, when a heart disease such as a channelopathy or cardiomyopathy is diagnosed, all immediate blood relatives should be evaluated by a specialist cardiologist to find out if they have an inherited heart disease.</p>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong><br />\nIt needs to be considered in sudden death in especially younger adults where the post Mortem fails to provide a cause of death, it is important to send the heart to a pathologist who specialises in this field of medicine and this may be a relative, friend or attending doctor who makes that request.<br />\nHowever, to help this research and appreciate the true incidence there must be a change in the Law.<br />\nIn the UK, unexplained sudden death is frequently recorded as due to death from natural causes. Until the law is changed and coroners have to refer hearts on to specialists we will not know the true figures. CRY&#8217;s fast track coroner / pathology service enables the cause of death in a sudden death case to be established more quickly and accurately than might otherwise happen if left to a local coroner lacking expertise in cardiac pathology.</p>\n<p><strong>Tests That Predict Risk</strong></p>\n<p>There are a number of tests that can be performed to determine if some- one is in a group that is at high risk for cardiac arrest. These include:<br />\n<strong>Echocardiogram</strong> \u2013 a painless test in which ultrasound waves are used to create a moving picture of the heart. The test can measure the strength of the heart\u2019s pumping function (ejection fraction) and identify other problems that may increase a person\u2019s risk for SCD.<br />\n<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/PwnCfZaSoLc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span><br />\n<strong>Electrocardiogram</strong> \u2013 A painless test in which electrodes are attached to the patient\u2019s chest to record the electrical activity of the heart in order to identify abnormal heart rhythms. Certain arrhythmias could point to an increased risk of SCD.<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image94.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-434\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image94.jpg?w=400&#038;h=320\" width=\"400\" height=\"320\" /></a><strong>Holter monitor</strong> \u2013 A cell phone-size recorder that patients attach to their chest for one to two days, recording a longer sampling of their heart rhythm. After the recorder is removed, the tape is analyzed for signs of arrhythmia.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image96.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-436\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image96.jpg?w=640&#038;h=191\" width=\"640\" height=\"191\" /></a><br />\n<strong>Event recorder</strong> \u2013 a pager-sized de- vice that also records the electrical activity of the heart over a longer period of time. Unlike a holter moni- tor, it does not operate continuously. Instead, patients activate the de- vice whenever they feel their heart beating too quickly or chaotically.<br />\n<strong>Electrophysiology study (EPS)</strong> \u2013 This test is performed in a hospital. A local anesthetic is used to numb areas in the groin or neck and thin flexible wires called catheters are<br />\nadvanced through veins into the heart under x-ray to record its electrical signals. During the study, the electrophysiologist studies the speed and flow of electrical sig- nals through the heart and paces the heart to see if arrhythmias can be induced. The physician can also determine if a patient has had a prior heart attack or evidence of prior heart damage without know- ing it. All of this information can help determine whether the patient is in a group at higher risk for SCD.<strong>There is another interesting device</strong><br />\nThe AliveCor Heart Monitor app is designed for medical professionals, patients and health conscious individuals to record, display, store and transfer accurate single-channel electrocardiogram (ECG) rhythms. These recordings could be saved on the mobile phone or shared with others (such as your doctor) via email.

To begin with, living a \u201cheart healthy\u201d life can help reduce the chances of dying of cardiac arrest or other heart conditions. This includes ex- ercising regularly, eating healthful foods, maintaining a reasonable weight, and avoiding smoking.<br />\nTreating and monitoring diseases and conditions that can contribute to heart problems, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes, is also important.<br />\nFinally, for some patients, preventing sudden cardiac death means controlling or stopping the abnormal heart rhythms that may trigger ventricular fibrillation.</p>\n<p><strong>Treating arrhythmias is done in three ways:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Medications</strong> \u2013 Medications, includ- ing ACE inhibitors, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and antiarrhythmics, can control abnormal heart rhythms or treat other conditions that may contribute to heart disease or SCD. But taking medication alone has not proved to be very effective in reducing cardiac arrest. These medications are sometimes taken by patients who also have an ICD, in order to reduce how often it fires.</p>\n<p><strong>Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs)</strong> \u2013 These devices have been very successful in preventing sudden cardiac death in high-risk patients. Like a pacemaker, ICDs are implanted under the skin. Wires called leads run from the ICD to the heart, and the device monitors the heart to detect any abnormal rhythms. If a dangerous arrhythmia is detected, the ICD delivers an electrical shock to re- store the heart\u2019s normal rhythm and prevent sudden cardiac death. The ICD can also act like a pacemaker if the heart is beating too slowly.</p>\n<p><strong>Catheter Ablation</strong> \u2013 In this technique, radiofrequency energy (heat), cryotherapy (freezing), or other energy forms are used to destroy small areas of heart muscle that cause the dangerous, rapid heart rhythms. The energy is delivered through catheters that are positioned through the veins or arteries to the heart. Catheter ablation is sometimes done in patients who have an ICD to decrease the frequency arrhythmias the number of ICD shocks.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image97.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-437\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image97.jpg?w=241&#038;h=209\" width=\"241\" height=\"209\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image98.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-438\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image98.jpg?w=640&#038;h=161\" width=\"640\" height=\"161\" /></a><br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image95.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-435\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image95.jpg?w=640&#038;h=191\" width=\"640\" height=\"191\" /></a></p>\n<p>If anyone has any particular concerns Dr Livingston has a special interest in this condition and is very knowledgable and would be pleased to discuss any related problem.</p>\n<p>Posted by Dr Bayer</p>\n", "post_id": 427, "location": false, "date": "06-23-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Mental health", "Mencap", "Learning disability", "holocaust", "bullying", "Ealing"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/berge.jpg\"><img src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/berge.jpg?w=200&#038;h=200\" alt=\"berge\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-452\" /></a></p>\n<p>We would like to bring to all our patients attention the wonderful work that one of the members of our patient participation group is doing for patients with Learning disabilities.<br />\nAs the article in the newspaper states &#8220;A PRO-ACTIVE man with a learning disability has made a documentary about the treatment of disabled people during the Holocaust.&#8221;</p>\n<p>We are very proud of our member of our PPG and would like to share his visions and work with all. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ealinggazette.co.uk/ealing-news/local-ealing-news/2013/06/19/ealing-man-s-holocaust-film-screened-at-commons-64767-33497745/\">http://www.ealinggazette.co.uk/ealing-news/local-ealing-news/2013/06/19/ealing-man-s-holocaust-film-screened-at-commons-64767-33497745/</a></p>\n", "post_id": 451, "location": false, "date": "06-25-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Phytotherapy", "Avicenna", "st Mary's Church Perivale", "phototherapy", "Canon of Medicine", "Amlodipine", "Health", "Maesteg", "angina", "hypertension", "calcium channel blocker", "health benefits", "yew"], "text": "<div><strong><strong><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image103.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-468\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image103.jpg?w=240&#038;h=209\" width=\"240\" height=\"209\" /></a><br />\n</strong></strong></p>\n<h3><strong>In 1021, Avicenna introduced the medicinal use of Taxus baccata for phytotherapy in The Canon of Medicine</strong>.</h3>\n<p>I hope that when I explain what this means you will find it all as fascinating as I did&#8230;&#8230;<br />\nFirstly, <strong>Avicenna, who is he?</strong></p>\n<p>Avicenna (Ibn S\u012bn\u0101) was born c. 980 in Qishlak Afshona, a village near Bukhara (in present-day Uzbekistan), the capital of the Samanids, a Persian dynasty in Central Asia and Greater Khorasan.

The Canon is considered one of the most famous books in the history of medicine.one of the chapters is dedicated to cardiology and treatment of hear conditions.Avicenna dedicated a chapter of the Canon to blood pressure. He was able to discover the causes of bleeding and haemorrhage, and discovered that haemorrhage could be induced by high blood pressure because of higher levels of cholesterol in the blood. This led him to investigate methods of controlling blood pressure.<br />\nAvicenna introduced the medicinal use of Taxus baccata for phytotherapy.</p>\n<p><strong>Phytotherapy</strong> is the study of the use of extracts from natural origin as medicines or health-promoting agents. The main difference of phytotherapy medicines from the medicines containing the herbal elements is in the methods of plants processing. Traditional phytotherapy is a synonym for herbalism and regarded as alternative medicine by much of Western medicine. Although the medicinal and biological effects of many plant constituents such as alkaloids (morphine, atropine etc.) have been proven through clinical studies, there is debate about the efficacy and the place of phytotherapy in medical therapies.<br />\nDespite Western medicines reservation about the use of herbs the herbal drug &#8220;Zarnab&#8221;(derived from Taxus baccata)was as a cardiac remedy by Avienna. This was the first known use of a calcium channel blocker drug, which were not in wide use in the Western world until the 1960s.</p>\n<p><strong>Taxus baccata</strong> is a conifer native to western, central and southern Europe, northwest Africa, northern Iran and southwest Asia. It is the tree originally known as yew, though with other related trees becoming known, it may now be known as English yew, or European yew.</p>\n<p>There has been a long association of yew trees in churchyards and there are at least 500 churchyards in England which contain yew trees which are older than the building itself. It is not known why there is this link but there are many theories- from yews being planted over the graves of plague victims to protect and purify the dead (as in All saints,Isleworth where there is a lage Yew growing over a large Plague pit) <a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image104.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-472\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image104.jpg?w=640&#038;h=469\" width=\"640\" height=\"469\" /></a><br />\nto the more mundane in that yews could be planted in churchyards as it was one of the only places that cattle did not have access and therefore would not be poisoned by eating the leaves. Yew trees are taken as symbols of immortality in many traditions, but are also seen as omens of doom. For many centuries it was the custom for yew branches to be carried on Palm Sunday and at funerals. In Ireland, it was said that the yew was \u2018the coffin of the vine\u2019 as wine barrels were made of yew staves. As the wood is so robust, in Medieval times it has been used in making long bows.<br />\nA yew tree that many of you may have seen is the one at the entrance of the door to St.Mary&#8217;s &#8216;Perivale our local lovely venue for concerts.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.st-marys-perivale.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.st-marys-perivale.org.uk/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image102.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-467\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image102.jpg?w=376&#038;h=226\" width=\"376\" height=\"226\" /></a></p>\n<p>When I read about Avicenna and his herbal medicine Zarnab, a patient called Clifford I looked after about 33yrs ago sprung to mind. This was when I worked as a GP in Maesteg,South Wales. He had been a miner but what I remember most was that he was a pigeon fancier and I remember visiting him regularly and in his lounge the walls were covered with framed photographs of various pigeons he had raced or tossed. He was now virtually bedbound and the he was considered  a &#8216;Cardiac cripple&#8217; which meant he could barely move without getting angina. Angiograms, coronary bypass or modern drugs for angina weren&#8217;t available and the few patients that were referred for surgery had to travel to London to the Hammersmith or the Brompton. Then one day I saw a pharmaceutical rep in surgery and he told me about a new drug called Nifedipine (Adalat) that was being recommended for angina aswell as hypertension and it was proving to be very effective, also if the patient bit the orange capsule(NO longer recommended) relief from angina was longer lasting than GTN tablets which was all that was available. I immediately thought of Clifford and was able to offer them to him and it was marvellous to see him come to the door on my next visit. This was my first experience of a <strong>Calcium Channel Blocker </strong>and experiencing its great value. Incredible to think it took the Western World mealy a 1000 yrs to rediscover this medication. Now a more refined drug called <strong>Amlodipine</strong> is first line in all patients &gt;55 yrs and Black people for hypertension and we very rarely see patients so incapacitated by angina.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image105.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-481\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image105.jpg?w=240&#038;h=160\" width=\"240\" height=\"160\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Read more fascinating facts about Yew in my next blog</strong><br />\nPosted by Dr Bayer</p>\n", "post_id": 461, "location": false, "date": "06-28-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": [], "text": "<p>Now 7 weeks and 3 days and 6 have survived although one tends to wander off but has rejoined the family.

One busy surgery on aTuesday morning I could feel the atmosphere of tension and anxiety that sometimes pervades the surgery and indeed during that morning 4 people got up and stormed out. On this occasion because of the way I perceived the vibes I decided to phone each one to see if I could give a telephone consultation or arrange to see them later. What shocked me was the fact that all 4 said they had been feeling desperate and that life was not worth living and waiting was the final straw. Interestingly each person was pleased I had phoned and in 2 cases the act of waiting then storming out angrily had made them feel much better and in effect had \u00a0&#8216;snapped&#8217; them out that of deep feeling.

He was the only one who somehow made it through. He made the point that if it wasn&#8217;t for his upbringing he had had, he probably would have been a good drug dealer. He made it his life&#8217;s work to research ways to prevent this tragic end of life.</p>\n<p>He presented this paper to at least 2000 health professionals in a very humble, unassuming manner. He was passionate about de stigmatising mental health, making the point that if someone had been in hospital with pneumonia or a heart attack friends and family would be keen to visit enquire about jprogress but if someone had been in John Connelly wing, St Bernard&#8217;s there would not be so much interest and people would keep away and not get involved.</p>\n<p>This rung a bell as from an early age I had a fascination for medicine and the workings of the body aswell discovering books about the ancient Egyptians and medicine. I also found myself listening in to conversations about ill members of the family or friends. Moreover, I always wondered what was the matter with those people who always came out of hospital with wooden trays displaying a chocolate box picture (a hunting scene or thatched cottage) and woven around the perimeter (the image of one below was found on eBay and being sold as a retro vintage tray!). <a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image108.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-489\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image108.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a><br />\nYears after this I then realised making the trays was occupational therapy following a nervous breakdown &#8211; and my observation was a display of the stigma of mental illness to cover up what the problem was which as a child seemed strange and somehow not right. It would be good to think that attitude like the tray has become retro and a vintage idea.</p>\n<p>Professor Andej Maru\u0161i\u010d then gave the following example:-<br />\nA<em> man; 47 years old; married, with problems, or married to problems; a father with worries &#8211; \u00a0employed or waiting to be employed; low back pain; irregular heart beat; feeling low; no appetite but not losing any weight; a warning for those who want to loose weight with depression; no libido; using sleeping tablets; no hobbies; drinking too much, and sports \u2013 our Slovenians are losing! \u00a0We will now try to diagnose the profile of our patient. \u00a0What do you think his doctors will diagnose? Burnout? The cardiologist will say \u201carrhythmia\u201d, as the patient is experiencing irregular heart beats; the orthopod will say \u201clumbago\u201d; the psychiatrist \u201cdepression\u201d; the psychologist \u201cneurotic structure with interpersonal relationship problems\u201d; the sociologist \u201cweak social network\u201d; the employer \u201cif it wasn&#8217;t for Employment Tribunal law you&#8217;d have been fired a long time ago\u201d: his wife \u201cI can\u2019t reach him\u201d because he has lost his libido and his children will say \u201cthe old man is bothering us again\u201d.</em> <em></em><em>That&#8217;s probably more or less the way his therapy would also go, although sometimes the therapies overlap, for example the general practitioner and the cardiologist would both prescribe sedatives. \u00a0 One would prescribe a benzodiazepine, the other a tranquiliser, while I must stress that these two are as similar as whisky and cognac \u2013 sedatives don&#8217;t cure. The orthopod would prescribe analgesics and give him back strengthening exercises, to which he would respond \u201cI don\u2019t have the time to do these\u201d; the psychiatrist would prescribe antidepressants, as this is almost the only thing we know how to do; t<em>he psychologist would say \u201cBe positive\u201d &#8211; I am allowed to make jokes about psychologists, because I am one &#8211; The sociologists would say \u201cIf we had a left</em> wing government you would probably feel better\u201d; the employer would say \u201cPlace him somewhere I don&#8217;t have to deal with him\u201d\u2019; his wife will say nothing, until she starts talking about the divorce, while his son and daughter are too young to have acquired a treatment licence.</em></p>\n<p><em>What is the main problem here?</em></p>\n<p><em>The main problem we are witnessing here is that different people see health from different perspectives. One is looking at just the ground plan, another at just the elevation, while a third just sees the cross section. Nobody sees the whole picture \u2013 the overall health of one entire body.</em> <em>Have you heard the saying \u201cWhen you are healthy, you have a thousand wishes, when you are ill you have just one wish\u201d This unfortunate 47 year old, who is supposed to \u201cBe positive\u201d\u2019 couldn&#8217;t care less who treats him, as long as he gets his health back.</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image110.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-508\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image110.jpg?w=191&#038;h=181\" width=\"191\" height=\"181\" /></a></p>\n<p>Most of my medical career we have always assumed that patients are suffering\u00a0<span style=\"line-height:1.5;\">from physical illnesses even contemplating it is &#8216;in the mind&#8217; and patients want it to be physical and would be offended if it was implied that it was&#8217; in the mind&#8217; but now for some time as doctors we are following a biopsychosocial model and when we are assessing a patient we are taking into account all three aspects of a patients health and welfare.When I visited the nursing home a week or so ago I was asked to see 2 or the residents both unable to express themselves due to dementia. One Dorothy was quiet, not eating , withdrawn and it was thought that perhaps she had an infection or was going into a decline might have even had a small stroke. Had she had a stroke, or an infection or another physical problem she would she have to leave the home to be looked after elsewhere. Inevitably, the nurse in charge and myself pondered over physical reasons. Lets check their blood, start them on antibiotics ,get an ECG, call in the Palliative care nurses etc. Then \u00a0we both said together could they be depressed and looking at it logically it was reasonable to consider that along with everything else. Indeed they were both started on antidepressant medication accordingly having examined possible physical and other mental problems and alerting staff to be attentive to their social needs within a few days they were both in the lounge chatting calmly sipping tea and enjoying a piece of cake! \u00a0The nurse manager and myself just sat and watched them with sheer delight and the ambiance \u00a0was now peaceful and calm. This wavs a demonstration of holistic care and it works!!</span></p>\n<p>I feel we are making progress and I would love to have been able to tell Professor Andrej Maru\u0161i\u010d that progress is being made. I have seen a real difference in the way employers treat patients that are depressed and I hahve no difficulty in writing &#8216;anxiety and depression&#8217; or &#8216;stress related illness&#8217; \u00a0as a cause of sickness absence. Also, most employers work actively with their employees to address issues that may be contributing or causing the problem and create good back to work plans. I now see patients who have had time off with mental illness and see them return to work and blossom handling their lives in a much healthier fashion.<br />\nIn these cases we made the decision for the patient as they were lacking mental capacity:it is different when both the doctor and patient with insight and capacity are trying to make that diagnosis. It&#8217;s also a bit more than \u00a0medication, cups of tea and cake but we have made some progress from secret hideaways and woven trays!</p>\n<p>Yesterday, I read in the News the following proposed pilot scheme :-</p>\n<p>Nurses are to go on patrol with four police forces across England to improve responses to mental health emergencies.<br />\nThe pilot scheme aims to ensure fewer people with mental health problems are detained in the wrong environment, the government says.<br />\nStreet triage teams are to be tested in the Derbyshire, Devon &amp; Cornwall, North Yorkshire and Sussex force areas.<br />\nThe patrols are part of an initiative funded by the Department of Health and backed by the Home Office.</p>\n<p>Have you heard Ruby Wax&#8217;s take on this- yes another TED talk <a href=\"http://blog.ted.com/2012/0627/stop-the-stigma-of-mental-illness-ruby-wax-at-tedglobal-2012/\">Stop the stigma of mental illness</a><br />\nI would like to be optimistic and feel that progress is being made in pdestigmatising Mental Health but I am sure there are cynics who are very guarded about that impression &#8211; lets watch this space!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image64.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-361\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image64.jpg?w=150&#038;h=62\" width=\"150\" height=\"62\" /></a> I will continue a further blog on his ideas of managing depression.</p>\n", "post_id": 486, "location": false, "date": "06-28-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Asthma", "nebuliser", "dragon", "Health", "reliever", "children's health", "preventer"], "text": "<p>Don&#8217;t worry I haven&#8217;t lost the plot &#8211; read on</p>\n<p>Introduction<br />\nMany people have talked about fairies at the bottom of the garden but I want to tell you about the dragons at the bottom of the surgery garden. You may be surprised at my letting out this long guarded secret but I felt it was time to let the secret out! They are very friendly and the young dragons often play with fox cubs and cats from next door. I have to say they only come out when all the patients and infact all the staff have gone home. I hadn&#8217;t told anyone and poor Dr Livingston got such a shock when they appeared one night when she was busy working after surgery had finished. I think she thought she was back in Wales as there are so many there but they are red and talk Welsh. The dragons in the garden are green and you can easily miss them.<br />\nI first came across red dragons in Wales : they are so important that the flag of Wales (Cymru) is a red dragon!!! ( Y Ddraig Goch) and has been for many years ( 1,184 years to be precise) ever since the red dragon conquered the white dragon .</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image112.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-513\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image112.jpg\" width=\" 150\" height=\"90\" /></a></p>\n<p>The story as written by Nennius a monk tells how young boy visited and revealed to King Vortigern, last of the Celtic kings of Britain that he had seen two serpents, one white and one red, who had been hidden deep underground fighting with fierce shrieking until finally the red one summoned his strength and drove the white one away.<br />\nThe story is then explained by the mysterious child: \u201cthe two serpents are two dragons; the red serpent is your dragon, but the white serpent is the dragon of the people who occupy several provinces and districts of Britain, even almost from sea to sea: at length, however, our people shall rise and drive away the Saxon race from beyond the sea, whence they originally came.\u201d The King then left North Wales where this event took place and built a castle in the South (on the Welsh/English border ) it was thought to be Caerwent, in Monmouthshire now part of Gwent.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s interesting that in February 2003 during his enthronement at Canterbury Cathedral Archbishop Rowan Williams ( a welshman from Monmouth wore hand-woven gold silk robes bearing a gold and silver clasp that showed the white dragon of England and the red dragon of Wales to symbolise the peace between the two countries.</p>\n<p>The red dragons are very friendly now but do tend to breathe more fire if England is playing rugby against Wales!!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image113.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-514\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image113.jpg?w=300&#038;h=272\" width=\"300\" height=\"272\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Story strictly for children ( adults can only read under child guidance)</strong></p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a picture of the family in the garden.

I don&#8217;t know how they ended up living in the surgery garden but they do have a slightly Irish accent and they are green so perhaps Liz or Mary the nurse had something to do with it!<br />\nAlso Derek&#8217;s brother is called Declan&#8230;..makes you wonder!</p>\n<p><strong>The Day Denis Dragon couldn&#8217;t breathe fire.</strong></p>\n<p>One evening last week when the sun was shining I was busily working and I suddenly heard a tap at the window. At first I thought it was the cat at the door miaowing for milk but when I \u00a0looked up I saw Denis Dragon looking very sad. I thought he had probably kicked his ball over the wall whilst playing with the cat and he wanted me to get it. I opened the doors to the garden and said , &#8220;What&#8217;s the matter Denis ?&#8221;<br />\n&#8220;Dr . Bayer I can&#8217;t br&#8230;.br&#8230;. breathe fire.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image125.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-606\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image125.jpg?w=225&#038;h=225\" width=\"225\" height=\"225\" /></a><br />\nIt was poor Denis, he was wheezing (not the cat miaowing) and he was very breathless and no fire was coming from his mouth. That is very serious for a dragon because breathing fire is very important to heat their food and keep themselves warm and keep dangerous creatures away.<br />\nThe next thing his mother Daphne was scampering up the garden and looking very worried.<br />\n&#8220;Come inside both of you and don&#8217;t worry Denis I have a special steam machine which will make you better in no time and don&#8217;t be frightened because its a bit noisy. It sounds like Thomas the Tank Engine warming up before he trundles off to see Edward and Henry along the track.&#8221; I said</p>\n<p>We walked slowly to the back room and I listened to Denis&#8217;s chest , counted his pulse on his wrist and how fast he was breathing and put a funny machine on his finger- it pinched a bit and the lights came on and numbers started appearing and I told Denis that I was measuring his Oxygen. It wasn&#8217;t long before I had set up the steam machine (adults call it a nebuliser)by squeezing some special medicine out of a tiny plastic bottle into a into a little cup and connecting by a tube to the machine. &#8220;Are you sitting comfortably,Denis?&#8221; I said and Denis shuffled a bit and held his mummy&#8217;s claw. I put the mask over his nose and mouth (a special one as dragons have big noses) and I switched the machine on. His mummy stayed with him all the time and as the steam puffed out Denis slowly felt much better and after we stopped the machine after about 5 minutes Denis was so happy to be feeling better that he gave a huge puff of fire so much that my tea nearly boiled out of the mug!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image41.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-635\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image41.jpg?w=256&#038;h=256\" width=\"256\" height=\"256\" /></a><br />\nHere is a picture of a little boy on a nebuliser</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image40.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-634\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image40.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200\"   /></a></p>\n<p>&#8221; Now Denis that&#8217;s not the end of story, because your mummy has told me that for a little while she has noticed that you have been getting more and more tired, the fire you have been blowing has been getting less and less and at night you have been coughing all the time . It has been worse since the trees and flowers have been in flower showering out pollen. Also she noticed that when you were racing with the cat and fox cubs that you were nearly always last and were not wanting to play with them anymore. I think you have got something called asthma.<br />\nHuman being children come to the surgery with this all the time and when we give them special medicine which they have to breathe in they get better and can play happily with their friends and start running as fast as their friends again and for young dragons they can breathe fire more easily.<br />\nThe breathing medicines are called inhalers, because breathing in is called inhaling and the one I will give you is a blue one: it is called Ventolin and is called a <strong>reliever</strong> because it makes you better.<br />\nYou must be very senlsible and never play games squirting it in the air and you don&#8217;t have to try it out first just shake it and you will hear the liquid in it swishing about.<br />\nIt is very important that you use these inhalers whenever your chest feels tight and you need to give one to your teacher in case you start wheezing in school and remember to take it with you when you go out anywhere.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image39.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-633\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image39.jpg?w=270&#038;h=182\" width=\"270\" height=\"182\" /></a></p>\n<p>This only relieves you for a short while and at this time of the year your chest will easily get tight so I think it is a good idea to take something to prevent or stop you getting wheezy.<br />\nGuess what we can give you another inhaler to do this and what do you think it&#8217;s a called? &#8220;<br />\nDenis thought for a while , &#8220;is it a stopper?&#8221; said Denis.<br />\nNot quite I said. Try again, I said it prevents wheezing that&#8217;s a clue.<br />\n&#8220;I know it&#8217;s a <strong>preventer</strong>&#8221; shouted out Denis nearly singeing my hair with the fire he breathed out in excitement.<br />\nYou must take this in the morning before school and when you get home in the evening.<br />\nThere is just one thing I must show you with before I teach you to use the inhaler. When children including dragon children try to breathe in with the inhaler it is so hard a bit like when you were a baby and it was hard to drink out of a cup so we have special thing called an aerochamber and this makes it much easier. When you use the aerochamber your breathing will be much better and mummy will be very happy to see you much better and will give an extra special bear hug.<br />\nInfact here are the instructions shown by a friendly bear. I think dragon children like teddy bears to cuddle aswell!<br />\nClick on link&#8230;&#8230;<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image42.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-638\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image42.jpg?w=125&#038;h=150\" width=\"125\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://frx.com/pi/AeroChamberPlusFlow-VuSmall-Medium_PI.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://frx.com/pi/AeroChamberPlusFlow-VuSmall-Medium_PI.pdf</a></p>\n", "post_id": 511, "location": false, "date": "07-18-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["cancer", "ovarian cancer", "Health", "kaposi sarcoma", "breast cancer", "health benefits", "yew"], "text": "<p>Recently I posted a blog talking about the history of yew and its use in medicine but I didn&#8217;t complete the story</p>\n<p>This remarkable tree, the Yew in the Central Himalayas, is used as a treatment for breast and ovarian cancer. But western medicine in order to satisfy their criteria had to find a way of isolating the drug from the natural source.<br />\nPacific yew&#8217;s bark were first collected in 1962 by researchers from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) who were under contract to NCI to find natural products that might cure cancer.<br />\nWhen this was found to be a potential anti-cancer drug there was outcry from the environmentalists including Al Gore as when collecting the bark this led to destruction of the tree.It was then found that the leaves of European yew (Taxus Baccata)were also an appropriate source which is a more renewable source than the bark of the Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia). This ended a point of conflict in the early 1990&#8242;s. Docetaxel (another taxane) can then be obtained by semi-synthetic conversion from the precursors.</p>\n<p>The precursors of chemotherapy drug <strong>Paclitaxel</strong> can be derived from the leaves or needles of the <strong>European Yew Taxus Baccata</strong><br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image114.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-517\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image114.jpg?w=209&#038;h=81\" width=\"209\" height=\"81\" /></a></p>\n<p>Paclitaxel is a chemotherapy drug. It is also known by its original brand name, <strong>Taxol</strong>. The drug is made from the needles of a particular type of yew tree. It works by stopping cancer cells separating into two new cells, so it blocks the growth of the cancer.

However it is my opinion that we need to be clear about the exact location of the batches of clipping that are used. At Hampton Court there are also avenues of yews, which are more important a source of origin than a yew hedge or maze. This is because yews in an avenue can be more readily identified as being female or male and, if it is not already becoming apparent in taxol research, it will become increasingly important to separate clippings into their gender origin. At present such attention is not given in the collection of clippings and if gathered from hedges or mazes, which are also to be found at Hampton Court, then the task of establishing gender is extremely difficult as both sexes of the yew grow so close to each other in such environments. Thus the yew avenue offers a better chance of gender selection at the outset and consequently vastly improves further research potential.</p>\n<p><strong>But how can you help? </strong><br />\nIf you or someone you know has a Yew hedge or tree the annual clippings can be used to produce this important anti-cancer medicine.

I remember when I was reprimanded by a local farmer about the state of the lower trunk telling me that I would be a hopeless doctor if I didn&#8217;t look after my diabetics legs and allowed them to get advanced leg ulcers so look after my trees trunks in the same way. I have been vigilant since and paid great attention to clearing the base of the tree and bandaging them if appropriate.</p>\n<p>Cherries are derived from either Prunus avium, the sweet cherry (also called the wild cherry). The native range of the sweet cherry extends through most of Europe, western Asia and parts of northern Africa, and the fruit has been consumed throughout its range since prehistoric times. Interestingly,where I am talking about where I planted the trees is in the Perigord, France and known to be the home of Primitive Man. That implies &#8216;man&#8217; has been eating cherries on summer days in the same place I did for a very long time!<br />\nAs I am sure followers of my blogs now appreciate I am curious about the wider benefits of foods and plants and this region which has been the home of hunter- gatherers for countless generations provides a constant source of interest.</p>\n<p>Cherries are known to contain <strong>Anthocyanins</strong> to have a marked anti-inflammatory action. Specifically, these compounds seem to be highly effective in treating gout, a condition that causes excruciating painful swelling in joints notoriously the great toe.

When the sun goes down and darkness occurs, the pineal is &#8220;turned on&#8221; by the suprachiasmatic nucleus(SCN) and begins to actively produce melatonin, which is released into the blood. Usually, this occurs around 9 pm. As a result, melatonin levels in the blood rise sharply and you begin to feel less alert. Sleep becomes more inviting. Melatonin levels in the blood stay elevated for about 12 hours &#8211; all through the night &#8211; before the light of a new day when they fall back to low daytime levels by about 9 am. Daytime levels of melatonin are barely detectable.<br />\nBesides adjusting the timing of the clock, bright light has another effect. It directly inhibits the release of melatonin. That is why melatonin is sometimes called the &#8220;Dracula of hormones&#8221; &#8211; it only comes out in the dark. Even if the pineal gland is switched &#8220;on&#8221; by the clock, it will not produce melatonin unless the person is in a dimly lit environment. In addition to sunlight, artificial indoor lighting can be bright enough to prevent the release of melatonin.<br />\nAlthough research is very limited, the use of melatonin for <strong>jet lag</strong> appears reasonable. Many published scientific studies conclude that melatonin can be effective for preventing or reducing jet lag, particularly for crossing five or more time zones and when traveling east. However, safe and appropriate use of melatonin needs further testing.<br />\nSome shift-workers alsobenefit from the use melatonin but using it check on the following link:-</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/medicine-guides/pages/MedicineOverview.aspx?condition=Insomnia&#038;medicine=melatonin&#038;preparationMelatonin%202mg%20modified-release%20tablets\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.nhs.uk/medicine-guides/pages/MedicineOverview.aspx?condition=Insomnia&#038;medicine=melatonin&#038;preparationMelatonin%202mg%20modified-release%20tablets</a></p>\n", "post_id": 526, "location": false, "date": "06-30-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Cough", "lifestyle", "Cancer research", "Health", "Lung cancer", "Red flags"], "text": "<div>The next Be Clear on Cancer (BCoC) national lung cancer symptom awareness campaign begins\u00a0<a href=\"//0\">on 2nd July 2013</a>\u00a0and will run for 6 weeks. \u00a0This is a top-up campaign, following last year\u2019s first ever national lung cancer symptom awareness campaign.</div>\n<div><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image114.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-517\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image114.jpg?w=209&#038;h=81\" width=\"209\" height=\"81\" /></a></div>\n<div><a href=\"http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/cancer-info/spotcancerearly/naedi/beclearoncancer/lung/\">http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/cancer-info/spotcancerearly/naedi/beclearoncancer/lung/</a></div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Lung cancer is England\u2019s biggest cancer killer claiming around 28,100 lives every year.

WECNF will now work on presenting a detailed 15-year spatial plan for the centre of West Ealing which could affect all our lives. It will be a plan that comes from the people who work and live in the centre of West Ealing: that&#8217;s unpaid volunteers who care deeply and personally about the space we all share. West Ealing Neighbours looks forward to working with WECNF whenever appropriate.</p>\n<p>I think the next few years are crucial for West Ealing. It feels as if the impacts of the regeneration of the Green Man Lane and Sherwood Close Estates, along with Crossrail, are starting to change the shape of the centre of West Ealing. At this key moment it is essential that the voices of local people and local businesses are heard. The big developers are well able to make themselves heard. WECNF can play a vital role over the next five years to ensure that the impact of these and other developments enhance the lives of everyone not just a few.</p>\n<p>West Ealing Neighbours encourages all its members to get involved in the Forum as it needs plenty of help to research and write this detailed spatial plan.

We as a practise have opted to participate in this Direct Enhanced Service (DES) and work with the PRG.</p>\n<p><strong>Patient Reference Group</strong><br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image7.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-563\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image7.jpg?w=300&#038;h=179\" width=\"300\" height=\"179\" /></a><br />\nThe purpose of the patient participation DES is to ensure that patients are involved in decisions about the range and quality of services provided and over time, commissioned by their practice. It aims to encourage and reward practices for routinely asking and acting on the views of their patients. This includes the patients being involved in decisions that lead to changes to the services their practice provides or commissions, either directly or in its capacity as gatekeeper to other services.It aims to promote the proactive engagement of patients through the use of effective Patient Reference Groups (PRGs) and to seek views from practice patients through the use of a local practice survey. The outcomes of the engagement and the views of patients are to be published on the practice&#8217;s website.</p>\n<p>Suggestions of aspects which may be discussed &#8211; NHS England<br />\nOne aspect that practices may wish to focus on is ensuring convenient access to the practice and also from the practice to other services in its role as coordinator of care, facilitating access to other health and social care providers.<br />\nAccess has many dimensions; the relative importance of these will vary according to the specific needs of the registered population. These dimensions include:<br />\n\uf0b7 lists being open to all<br />\n\uf0b7 hours of opening with the ability to be seen urgently when clinically necessary, as well as<br />\nthe ability to book ahead<br />\n\uf0b7 continuity of care<br />\n\uf0b7 range of skills available &#8211; access to different professionals<br />\n\uf0b7 a choice of modes of contact which currently includes face-to-face, telephone and electronic contact, but can be developed further as technology allows<br />\n\uf0b7 geographical access, enabling care as close to home as possible.<br />\nAccess must be flexible enough to meet the varying needs of individualsand requires sufficient capacity to meet the population&#8217;s needs. Details of access arrangements (including opening hours) should be made widely available to the patient population to enable patients to exercise choice.</p>\n<p>Patient Reference Group (PRG) may be an existing formal patient participation group or a similar group that is representative of the practice population, which would feed in its views alongside the findings from the surveys and agree with the practice priority areas for possible change. This would result in an action plan to be agreed between the practice and the PRG.<br />\nPractices taking part in this DES will also carry out a properly constituted survey of a sample of the practice&#8217;s patients looking at a broad range of areas which could include convenience of access (opening times, ability to book ahead, ability to be seen quickly, telephone answering), patients&#8217; experience of the treatment and service they receive, the physical environment in the practice and other issues specific to individual practices.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image8.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-564\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image8.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a><br />\nAs I am sure some of you are aware we have already participated in having meetings with a cross section of patients during the past few years to discuss results of patients surveys addressing issues such as access to doctors, telephone access, car parking,email prescription requests, children in surgery and more recently patient education and we have attempted to improve our service and act on points raised in the survey. The minutes of these meetings are published on our website. This was formerly called the Patient Participation Group but will know be known as the Patient Reference Group.<br />\nWe have tried to make our meetings representative of the patient population but along with our GP colleagues we have found the numbers participating are small and some types of patients are not represented. Nevertheless, we are persevering to reach our patients by our website,written newsletters and survey sheets distributed over a period of time to a wide cross section of patients.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image9.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-565\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image9.jpg?w=300&#038;h=176\" width=\"300\" height=\"176\" /></a></p>\n<p>We will be announcing a PRG meeting in the next few weeks and conducting a survey with patients attending the surgery and strongly encourage as many people as possible to participate.

Yet only 13% of current NHS health expenditure is on mental health. The World Health Organisation estimates that depressive disorders were the third biggest global health problem in 2004 and by 2030 they will be the largest.<br />\nWhat is important is, that when we talk about \u2018mental health\u2019 we take into account everything we see &#8211; appearance, behaviour, the way the person moves and what they say. Based on this we can assume what we think and guess which mood someone is currently in. If I was crying five minutes ago and then yelled at you in the next five minutes you would probably think my mood very unstable and would benefit from seeing \u00a0a psychiatrist.</p>\n<p>This is mental health, as we see. \u00a0Psychiatrists frequently make assumptions &#8211; GPs do the same &#8211; and, actually, this is not a big deal. <em>Firstly,what we see and assume about mental health, about the health of someone\u2019s mind, is captured between two very important determinants &#8211; one is genetics and the other is environment.</em><br />\n<em><br />\n<em>Genetics may appear less important when it comes to mental health, but that\u2019s not true because two thirds of our genes determine our brain function, whilst the remaining third determines all our other organs. Hence, genetics is very important when it comes to mental health, but clearly it is not the only thing that is important. Each and every one of us is like a book &#8211; full of genes that only express themselves if we allow them to do so. If you spent all your life in the same town and had the same job as your father who also lived and worked in the same town all his life, it is clear, that you will be more likely to suffer the same diseases as your father. But if you move from one town to another , or even another country, you would probably be experiencing something else as different genes would appear in your book.<br />\nBut we must remember that we should never underestimate the role of genetics in mental health. For instance, have you ever heard of two elderly people in care homes been accidentally \u201cswapped\u201d? I doubt it. Babies, however, have been accidentally swapped. This implies that our unique genetic fingerprint becomes more defined each day and with every day we become more and more who we are, and those of you who would like to be as different as possible from your parents should be aware that we become more and more like our parents every day.<br />\nI have to say when I worked in a community in South Wales where extended families stayed in the same village or town and rarely moved away the genetic element of disease was very more obvious but when I came to London I have been aware of how the environment has more of an impact on health. I remember a type of woman who functioned reasonably well and then periodically took to her bed unable to open her eyes or respond to anyone and was often married to a doting, caring husband who waited on her hand and foot but was descibed as &#8216;just like her mother or aunt&#8217; implying a genetic element. Everyone feared that if the husband died as to how she would cope but as often happened the husband did die first but surprisingly enough the woman thrived in more ways than one. If I speak to anyone from that community they know exactly what I mean. Is it depression? Is it unhappiness but whatever it is the person often female needs to withdraw or opt out to survive and in my experience survived to a good age. However,in London most people troubled by mental health problems associate it with stress or change of environment with perhaps some genetic factors.<br />\nThe second very important thing to consider when assessing \u2018mental health\u2019 is that it is \u2018captured\u2019 between temperament and behavioural habits. What is temperament ? when a person attends surgery they adopt very similar behavioural pattern on each visit and it makes it virtually impossible for to say anything about a persons temperament when they are seen in surgery.<br />\nWe all have a temperament which should be tested frequently to determine to what each of us is prone. When I was in a family practise with may be four generations of a family in a close community it was easier to establish the temperant as receptionists or other people gave you the &#8216;gossip&#8217; &#8220;she is always the life and soul of the party&#8221; or &#8220;he nevers goes out, never has!&#8221;</em></em></p>\n<p>We also have behavioural patterns, this is what we do during most of our waking hours depending on what our role or work is and different behavioural patterns are prone to different diseases.</p>\n<p>The third most important thing is the fact that mental health falls somewhere in between mental health in a very narrow sense and mental illness. Whenever someone develops a mental disorder, or mental illness they can be restored to full health. When famous athletes injure themselves, their performances drops that season, but in the seasons to follow they can improve their results.<br />\nOr for example, when a manager gets depression, if he recovers he will manage his company better, I believe, because he starts to understand other people and empathises with them better.<br />\nI remember being in conversation with GP colleagues and telling them that there were some days I could get full score on depression assessment and some colleagues agreed but one colleague said &#8220;I never get depressed&#8221;. Not only were we surprised but wondered how she managed to empathise with most of her patients.</p>\n<p><em>When you go to the gym you learn to lift increasingly heavier weights for longer periods of time without developing aches in your muscles. You can use the same principle to practise psycho-fitness.<br />\nIn the same way that someone who regularly goes to the gym can say \u201cI have been practising this for six months now. I can run for quite some time, I don\u2019t feel at all tired and I am in very good shape\u201d, someone who practices psycho-fitness can develop their abilities to put up with 8Mb of stress instead of 4Mb, or even 12Mb and still go to bed without any worries on their mind.</em><br />\nThis makes sense as I am aware when you have a stressful job alongside personal stresses I is imperative that you practise psycho-fitness.</p>\n<p><em>The best thing our mothers and teachers can give us while we are growing up is self-confidence. Self-confidence strengthens our psycho-skeleton which can then put up with more, which means that we can live more easily and are less likely to develop different mental disorders. Italian and Jewish mothers constantly build up their children\u2019s self-confidence by telling them that they are the best looking, the smartest and so on. Whilst it can be difficult to work with such people, who are so full of themselves, you must admit they never suffer mental health problems.</em><br />\n<em>You may be familiar with the phrase &#8216;nervous breakdown&#8217; for depression. The best way to describe what really happens: the psycho-skeleton breaks, the psycho-muscularity breaks, and this expresses itself on the monoamine level.<br />\nOur ability to deal with problems diminishes, our hardware becomes soft. The bottom line is something breaks under the burdens we carry in our backpack, for example physical disability, diabetes or cancer. Sometimes the trigger can be a physical or mental illness which one of our parents may be suffering from.</em></p>\n<p><em>Imagine,a newly retired lady who resolves to go to her holiday home, every</em><em>week-end, with her husband. But then her mother develops dementia and, she has to become her mother\u2019s carer and something she has looked forward to doing is thwarted. In short, burdens like this can break us, and when we get hit; from the left or from the right &#8211; it doesn&#8217;t matter from which direction \u2013 this hit is like a loss and when we lose something the chance of developing depression increases.<br />\nIf we are afraid of something the chances of us getting anxious are greater. This is scientifically proven and this breaks us, and when it breaks us we develop depression, which usually manifests itself via biological symptoms, so even though this is a psychiatric disorder it manifests with typical biological symptoms, i.e.a person wakes up every two hours and cannot sleep and if he sleeps for six or eight hours he is just as tired because he lacks the REM (rapid eye movement) dream phase, which helps him reorganise his thoughts. Then he develops psychological symptoms, such as guilt feelings or other distressing feelings. Or the other way around: there are people whose psychological structure is so inclined to depression that they push themselves into depression. The explanation is that they have loads of negative thoughts; that they are inclined to think negatively.<br />\nIn 1952 Norman Vincent Peale wrote a book &#8216;Power of Positive Thinking&#8217; which was created a significant following for many years. He quoted<br />\n\u201cThe way to happiness: Keep your heart free from hate, your mind from worry. Live simply, expect little, give much. Scatter sunshine, forget self, think of others. Try this for a week and you will be surprised.\u201d<br />\nHowever, as Andrej Maru\u0161i\u010d suggested it could be argued whether there are such things as negative or positive thoughts. &#8220;If I tell my children they are not going out until they have finished their homework, this is a positive thought for me, because I am raising them up to be good citizens, although it is a negative thought for them as they are not allowed to go out.<br />\nSo who will be the judge of what\u2019s positive and what\u2019s negative? The Prime Minister? I don&#8217;t consider anybody able to judge what is negative and what is positive.&#8221;<br />\nLet me illustrate how people think. Basically, we think all the time and our thoughts usually follow the same pattern. Every initial thought is followed by a second thought, usually associated with the first, and so on \u2013 moving around universe of thoughts, quite healthily thinking both positively and negatively. This is completely normal, but what happens if a \u201cshort circuit\u201d occurs? A short circuit can even occur with completely positive thoughts. Let&#8217;s imagine the thought \u201cIf I stop going to work, I&#8217;ll be fired\u201d. This is a positive thought, in general, since someone who thinks like this is smart and can anticipate consequences. But if this thought is so disturbing and causes so many worries that this person actually stops going to work then this thought \u2013 due to its monotony \u2013 bears potential for depression.</em><br />\nNow, let&#8217;s see how I &#8211; and a few others &#8211; distinguish between the different types of depression by dividing them into three groups: Blue depression, Red depression, Yellow depression.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image22.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-601\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image22.jpg?w=300&#038;h=187\" width=\"300\" height=\"187\" /></a><br />\n<strong>Blue depression</strong> is the most prevalent and this is why the circle is the biggest and that is the so-called serotonin depression, which is characterised by sleeping disorders, people wake up two hours earlier, they are tired, their appetite is weak and their libido low. A weak appetite doesn&#8217;t mean less food intake and a low libido doesn&#8217;t mean less sex.<br />\nBut to me sexuality is not just lying back and thinking of England, it should be joyous.<br />\nIn short, lack of serotonin reduces libido. In this picture dreams are coloured blue. Dreams are very important but not because you are explaining what you were dreaming while lying on the couch. Dreams are nothing other than recollections of what you experienced through the day put into perspective against your past experiences. This enables us to store only relevant data, as if cleaning up our computer desktop and we place these files into different directories and, according to how much we save, our day may appear long or short.</p>\n<p>For example, if you go to Taiwan for a week, this week will appear much longer to you because you will store more data during your dreams than you would during a week at work where you&#8217;ve been employed for the last 10 years. We accumulate our memories from our dreams. As we age we experience things we have already experienced before, so time appears shorter. There is a big difference between four years at school and four years at work, when we are 40 years old. We think time passes quicker as we age, because we don\u2019t store memories we have already laid down \u2013 we are not travelling to Taiwan.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image23.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-602\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image23.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Red depression</strong> is a lack of will, a lack of motivation and a lack of energy. This is a very important depression, so-called noradrenergic depression, and doctors know, that when they give a patient noradrenalin in intensive care, the patient suddenly wakes up, gets up and this is what a noradrenergic depression patients is lacking.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image24.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-603\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image24.jpg?w=284&#038;h=177\" width=\"284\" height=\"177\" /></a><br />\nPatients with <strong>yellow depression</strong> related to levels of dopamine lack enthusiasm and \u201cjoie de vivre\u201d or motivated behaviour- &#8220;get up and go&#8221;. This type of depression is more complex and there are still no specific antidepressants for this type of depression although those on the market do help in some situations. It can be drug induced or in diseases such as Parkinson&#8217;s disease which is classically due to severe lack of Dopamine.</p>\n<p>With all three types of depression people develop specific psychological symptoms<br />\nPeople with blue depression feel emotionally empty, people with red depression become sad, I know that about I wanted you to see; and people with yellow depression feel extreme hopelessness.</p>\n<p>All these people can develop feelings of guilt, low self-esteem and so on. A good psychiatrist, or GP, will listen to you to understand when and how your depression started. If he/she puts you on an antidepressant before you stop talking, turn around and walk out. What\u2019s the target? Every good psycho-pharmacologist must know what he is treating. However. sometimes it is more obvious and the target is reached immediately but in more complex depression which may involve a mixture of more than one types it may changing medication until the appropriate target is met.When the correct medication is found biological depression disappears automatically within four weeks, while psychological symptoms remain. Feelings of guilt are usually the last to disappear.<br />\nIn summary mental health falls somewhere in between mental health in a very narrow sense and mental illness. It must take into account &#8211; appearance, behaviour, the way the person moves and what they say. It is determined partly by genetics and partly by environment depending on where a person spends their life , either remaining in the family circle or moving away. It is also captured between temperament and behavioural patterns.<br />\nThe type of depression if diagnosed properly medication can treat it effectively. Healthy mental health can be maintained by psycho-fitness which will be my next blog!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image64.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-361\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image64.jpg?w=150&#038;h=62\" width=\"150\" height=\"62\" /></a></p>\n<p>The Samaritans is available for anyone struggling to cope, round the clock, every single day of the year.

Their cases were as similar as I could have them.&#8221; Lind went on the describe a classic therapeutic experiment on sailors with scurvy in which various proposed remedies were tested as antiscorbutics. His experiment provided clear evidence of the curative value of oranges and lemons and was also the first example of a controlled clinical nutrition study using human subjects.<br />\nBritish sailors in the Royal Navy were known in the 1850s as &#8220;limeys&#8221; a term which is thought to have originated in the 1850s as &#8220;lime-juicer&#8221;, and was later shortened to &#8220;limey&#8221;.It was originally used as a derogatory word because of the Royal Navy&#8217;s practice since the beginning of the 19th century of adding lemon juice or lime juice to the sailors&#8217; daily ration of watered-down rum (known as grog), in order to prevent scurvy.<br />\n<strong>WARNING SIGNS OF SCURVY</strong><br />\nScurvy is characterised by swollen and bleeding gums with loosened teeth, soreness and stiffness of the joints and lower extremities, bleeding under the skin and in deep tissues, slow wound healing, and anemia.

Its roots are bulbs that also produce rhizomes, which then produce stems and roots for new plants. Turmeric is fragrant and has a bitter, somewhat sharp taste. Although it grows in many tropical locations, the majority of turmeric is grown in India, where it is used as a main ingredient in curry.<br />\nThe roots, or rhizomes and bulbs, are used in medicine and food. They are generally boiled and then dried, turning into the familiar yellow powder. Curcumin, the active ingredient, has antioxidant properties. Other substances in this herb have antioxidant properties as well.<br />\nTurmeric is widely used in cooking and gives Indian curry its flavor and yellow color. It is also used in mustard and to color butter and cheese.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image27.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-612\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image27.jpg?w=300&#038;h=222\" width=\"300\" height=\"222\" /></a></p>\n<p>The problem with the pill is that it is very insoluble in water.The better way to take it, is to use it in your cooking very extensively.

An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) usually causes no symptoms unless it ruptures (bursts). A ruptured pAAA is often fatal. An AAA less than 55 mm wide has a low chance of rupture. An operation to repair the aneurysm may be advised if it is larger than 55 mm, as above this size the risk of rupture increases significantly.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>40 mm-55 mm: about a 1 in 100 chance of rupture per year.</div>\n<div>55 mm-60 mm: about a 10 in 100 chance of rupture per year.</div>\n<div>60 mm-69 mm: about a 15 in 100 chance of rupture per year.</div>\n<div>70 mm-79 mm: about a 35 in 100 chance of rupture per year.</div>\n<div>80 mm or more: about a 50 in 100 chance of rupture per year.</div>\n<div>As a rule, for any given size, the risk of rupture is increased in smokers, males, those with high blood pressure, and those with a family history of an AAA.</div>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Here we go again prevention again \u00a0those same old high risk factors appearing again!</div>\n<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image34.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-623\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image34.jpg?w=183&#038;h=95\" width=\"183\" height=\"95\" /></a></p>\n<div></div>\n<div>It has been claimed that no aspect of vascular disease management has changed as much in the past decade as the management of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm may be performed surgically through an open incision in the abdomen and inserting a graft or in a minimally-invasive procedure called endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) which involves inserting a stent-graft via the major arteries in the legs (femoral artery) Under X-ray guidance involving no abdominal incision. The EVAR \u00a0can be carried out under epidural and in patients that would be unable to cope with a general anaesthetic.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>It reminded me of those on -call days as a surgical houseman admitting someone with a leaking AAA \u00a0involved a long surgical procedure and often a prolonged hair-raising recovery which in those days for me meant little sleep \u00a0and watchful waiting&#8230; \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0often going back to theatre as the rather crude grafts leaked or became infected as the surgery was performed by a General \u00a0surgeon \u00a0rather than the skilled vascular surgeons of today. Many patients were too ill to cope with general anaesthetic and the complication and death rate was high.</div>\n<div>Those days are past the prognosis for treatment has drastically improved so it makes sense to screen and offer a good outcome to those who are found to have an AAA before symptoms such \u00a0as\u00a0a pulsing feeling in the abdomen, similar to a\u00a0heartbeat and/or pain\u00a0\u00a0in the \u00a0abdomen or lower back\u00a0are apparent.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>&lt; <strong>NHS AAA Screening Programme</strong></div>\n<div>A new NHS AAA Screening Programme is being gradually introduced across England and aims to reduce deaths from ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms through early detection.</div>\n<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image35.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-624\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image35.jpg?w=300&#038;h=106\" width=\"300\" height=\"106\" /></a></p>\n<div></div>\n<div>The roll-out of the National Screening Programme \u00a0began in March 2009, following research that showed it could reduce the rate of premature death from ruptured AAA by 50 per cent.

However,younger men, or women with a family history, can be scanned under existing NHS procedures.</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>GPs are recommended to consider referring patients with a sibling or parent with an AAA for a scan at the medical imaging department at an age five years younger than that at which their relative\u2019s AAA was first diagnosed.</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>Self-referral may be appropriate \u00a0if a patient missed out on an automatic invitation.</div>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<div><strong>Screening for AAA</strong></div>\n<div></div>\n<div>An AAA occurs because of degeneration of the wall of the abdominal aorta. Large AAA are rare, but can be very serious;ruptured AAA accounts for about 5,000 deaths every year in England and Wales. Small AAA pose little immediate risk, but can expand, so it is essential to monitor them.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>The screening process for AAA is a simple ultrasound scan and patients receive their results immediately. This ensures that men with a small AAA who require regular ultrasound surveillance are identified and offered advice on reducing cardiovascular risk factors. Their GP may be asked to review their medication and reassess their BP monitoring.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Antiplatelet and statin therapy is recommended for men with a small AAA and smoking cessation can reduce the rate of expansion, in addition to its other health benefits.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Other screening outcomes include a small number of men with an aorta of 5.5cm diameter or more, who are referred to a vascular surgery team. Most men who have no signs of an AAA are reassured.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>The main risk factors for AAA are smoking, hypertension and a family history (first-degree relative with AAA). Men who are most likely to benefit from self-referral for screening are therefore those in their late 60s and early 70s who have one or more of these factors.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Each GP practice is informed when a patient of theirs is screened, then updated with the results. Patients can then discuss the results with their GP.</div>\n<div>For more information:-</div>\n<div><a href=\"http://www.circulationfoundation.org.uk/help-advice/abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/\">http://www.circulationfoundation.org.uk/help-advice/abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/</a></div>\n</div>\n<div><strong>Benefits and risks</strong></div>\n<div>\n<div>Despite only just completing national roll-out, the programme has already delivered promising results.

In the early part of the 20th century, farmers in the northern prairie states of Canada and the USA began planting sweet clover plants imported from Europe. Although the sweet clover proved to be nutritious when used as fodder, it also brought a fatal disease which decimated cattle herds and horrified farmers: sweet clover disease, in which affected cattle developed relentless, spontaneous bleeding. Schofield, a veterinary pathologist in Alberta, reported in 1921 that the disease was caused by consumption of spoilt sweet clover hay. The fresh plant was known to contain the compound coumarin, which was not pathogenic. The mystery of why spoilt hay caused the disease was solved by Karl Paul Link and his co-workers in 1940 : in mouldy hay, coumarin is oxidised to 4-hydroxycoumarin and then coupled with formaldehyde and another coumarin moiety to form dicoumarol, an anticoagulant. This was responsible for the disease. Dicoumarol was patented in 1941 and was therapeutically used as an anticoagulant.<br />\nIn 1951, a navy recruit unsuccessfully attempted suicide with 567 mg of warfarin. His surprising full recovery induced research into the anticoagulant potency of warfarin in humans. It was found to be far superior to dicoumarol. Clinicians quickly discarded dicoumarol in favour of &#8220;rat poison&#8221; warfarin : it was introduced commercially in 1954. In that same year, President Eisenhower was treated with warfarin following a heart attack.<br />\n<em>As an aside I remember several years ago a delightful 98year old lady appearing in surgery asking to register provided she was not too old. She had been the Professor of Agriculture of Warsaw ( and honorary Professor at Glasgow)and believe or not in the waiting room at the same time she rediscovered an old student ( at that time 88yrs) a patient well known to me and he had been a farrier and a reputable breeder of Welsh mountain Ponies in South Wales before retiring to Ealing. It turned out that she had introduced sweet clover to Poland! </em></p>\n<p>Warfarin is used used by more than 75,000 patients for short term or long term use and not only is it cheap at 2p a tablet but its anticoagulant effect is well tried and tested and its effect can be easily reversed in the event of gastro-intestinal bleeding or need of surgery. The anticoagulant level is easily measured. However, warfarin is slow to take effect and stabilise; constant monitoring is necessary as there is significant interaction with alcohol and some medication, food stuffs commonly leafy vegetables and cranberry juice and all foods containing Vitamin K and should be taken carefully<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image48.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-650\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image48.jpg?w=251&#038;h=201\" width=\"251\" height=\"201\" /></a><br />\n<strong>diet sheet</strong> </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.atrialfibrillation.org.uk/files/file/Publications/120426-st-FINAL-Warfarin%20and%20Diet_pdf.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.atrialfibrillation.org.uk/files/file/Publications/120426-st-FINAL-Warfarin%20and%20Diet_pdf.pdf</a></p>\n<p>Patients must be totally compliant and maintain a record of INR readings(the <strong>yellow book</strong>)<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image47.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-649\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image47.jpg?w=150&#038;h=150\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><br />\nthere is a risk of bleeding but someone would have to fall 200 times to have significant blood loss ie from bruising.<br />\nRecently a new class of drugs have been released and Rivaroxaban will be the drug of choice in Ealing- this decision has been met after consultation with our local consultant cardiologists, who we meet with in the surgery or at joint meetings.

She was a friend of my daughters and I had known her for several years as she had come back after school for tea and been on sleepovers! I said she could come to the surgery but warned her that it was totally confidential and she must not tell anyone who,what she had seen when she came. She seemed thrilled at the idea that she could even tell her parents not to ask questions and her mothers feedback was that after 2 weeks she felt her had suddenly &#8216;grown up&#8217; and she herself was determined to become a doctor despite doing my best to tell her all the disadvantages. Indeed, she went to UCL medical school and during her studies returned on several occasions to work in the surgery including being our first phlebotomist.

Antiserum was one of the few active treatments available to the GP, and if given within 24 hours of onset the results were excellent.</div>\n<div>Otherwise, the mortality was about 20 per cent.</div>\n<div>In the practise we have an elderly patient who has described \u00a0her experience of having diphtheria as a child and those that died around her, to several of our medical students.</div>\n<div>Patients with \u00a0diphtheria or scarlet fever were taken away in a yellow &#8216;fever van&#8217; to the infectious diseases hospital for at least six weeks often known as the &#8216; Isolation hospital &#8216; which were situated on the outskirts of small towns;</div>\n<div>\u00a0no visitors were allowed.</div>\n<div>Lobar pneumonia was common, and with the more fortunate patients there was a crisis about the seventh day. It struck terror into the patients\u2019 and the doctors\u2019 hearts, for the mortality was popularly thought to be at least 50 per cent and sulphonamides were not invariably curative.</div>\n<div>My predecessor, Dr Ralph Thomas son of Dr Bell Thomas when I worked in Maesteg South Wales described the experience often referring to a patient he noticed coming through the door.</div>\n<div>He related the anxious moments of how he had to wait by the bedside to see if the patient &#8216;pulled through&#8217; . By the time I had qualified more antibiotics were available and this occurrence was less frequent but did occur.</div>\n<div>My nearest experience to this was when treating a young person with heart failure (secondary to heart valve disease following rheumatic fever) in their home by injecting \u00a0intravenous diuretics and waiting for the chest to clear and the breathing become easier. Unfortunately on several occasions I had to experience the patient die before my eyes as the medicine failed to take effect. The local hospital was 20 miles away and in the Winter months roads were blocked, ambulances poorly equipped by modern standards and medication less sophisticated and surgery was only possible if the patient was willing to travel\u00a0to London 200miles away with no Motorway. Only the most advanced heart cases were referred to London and then the waiting list \u00a0was long and the prognosis was poor and many never returned or if they did they came back with a stroke or other complication.</div>\n<div>Alternatively , heart surgery was performed by the general surgeon overseen by the general physician who took ECG&#8217;s during surgery and cared for them postoperatively I recall a physician showing me an amazing ECG which went flat as the surgery was performed and as the heart was sutured the \u00a0rhythm \u00a0returned to normal as the heart recovered.</div>\n<p>At that time nearly about 35years ago it was found that a patient would have a better chance of survival staying at home rather than being admitted to hospital.</p>\n<div></div>\n<div>Most dreaded was tuberculosis, blood in the handkerchief after a fit of coughing.</div>\n<div>Some families were especially vulnerable and it tended to strike young people.</div>\n<div>The course could be lingering or extremely rapid, with death within weeks.</div>\n<div>Lung cancer was rare. If it occurred, it would probably not be recognised.</div>\n<div>Miners were particularly vulnerable and I remember doing an attachment at Sully Hospital outside Cardiff which was built for the purpose of admitting TB patients who had 6-12 months stays. It was a beautiful hospital where every room had a sea view, the downside was that each morning we had to check everyone&#8217;s sputum on a daily basis reporting a full description! But again treatment was evolving and immunisation available so cases were fewer chest problems were mostly attributed to pneumoconiosis a disease contracted by miners and incredibly debilitating, but an interesting group of patients to work with &#8211; full of tales, humour and of course great voice if they still had breath to sing.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Almost half the babies were delivered at home, mainly a matter for midwives. Pain relief in labour, although available in hospital, might not be provided in the home.</div>\n<div>\u00a0When things went wrong the GP would be summoned, because procedures such as breech birth or manual removal of the placenta might be required.</div>\n<div>Most GPs used chloroform as an anaesthetic though some felt it was quicker and safer without.</div>\n<div>As they might have neither the skills nor the equipment to handle problems, in many places obstetric flying squads, based on the hospitals, had been established. These could deal with haemorrhage, shock and eclampsia (fits during late pregnancy, labour and the period shortly after), transfuse patients, give anaesthetics, and undertake operative obstetrics in the home.</div>\n<div>In Maesteg the miners \u00a0had raised money to build a hospital with a maternity unit but I remember the &#8216;Flying squad &#8216; going out to Obstertric \u00a0emergencies. Sadly a street in my practise in Cymfelin near Maesteg had the highest incidence of spina bifida/ anencephaly in the World. Now virtually prevented by taking folic \u00a0acid \u00a0supplements and \u00a0I along with other doctors at \u00a0that time were involved the original trials.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Tales of obstetric disaster, haemorrhage after delivery and problems with forceps were only too common, although remarkably many women survived crises unthinkable today. Serious infections (puerperal sepsis) killed mothers after childbirth, particularly if there were sore throats going round.</div>\n<div>Pain and discomfort were accepted as part of life to be endured with stoicism. The family doctor had to be tough to get on with his many interesting and rewarding tasks.</div>\n<div>If he had access to a hospital, he might set a simple fracture or reduce a dislocation. Working class people did not expect to be comfortable.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Most went hungry and their undernourished children showed evidence of rickets until vitamin D supplements, provided by welfare clinics, controlled it. Many were miserably cold in winter unless they were roasting in front of the coal fire in the kitchen. I remember patients describing these events when children ran around in bare feet and men fought over food for their families.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Although screening is considered part of modern NHS I was inspired 35 years ago by Dr Julian Hart , a neibouring GP in his practice in Glyncorrwg, Wales, was the first in the UK to be recognised as a research practice, piloting many Medical Research Council studies. He was also the first doctor to routinely measure every patient\u2019s blood pressure and as a result was able to reduce premature mortality in high risk patients at his practice by 30%. Inspired by this as soon as I became the Principal at the Avenue I performed a new patient check on every patient who presented \u00a0and this now continues for all new patients. The Government as just announced it in today&#8217;s headlines &#8216;Free health checks could save lives, Jeremy Hunt says&#8217;</div>\n<div><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-23394314\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-23394314</a></div>\n<div>I remember in the first year I diagnosed 19 new diabetics including an 18 year old and many new patients walking around with high blood pressure.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Successful treatment by the family doctor was accepted with gratitude and the many failures were tolerated without rancour or recrimination.</div>\n<div>Patients\u2019 expectations were not high. The death of children from infectious disease was the way of the world. Mothers of feverish children expected, if the child was not to be admitted to the fever hospital, to be told that bed rest was crucial until the fever had fully subsided.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>GPs\u2019 hours were long, as most practices were single-handed and deputising services were non-existent.</div>\n<div>I remember working alternative days and nights with my GP partner \u00a0aswell doing daily ward rounds at the geriatric hospital and the Cottage hospital.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image49.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-662\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image49.jpg?w=450&#038;h=293\" width=\"450\" height=\"293\" /></a>There were no McMillan nurses and terminally ill patients were seen up to 4 times daily ( last visit\u00a010pm) \u00a0to administer pain relief. We got to know these families and the reward was simply managing the situation well.</div>\n<div>\u00a0Local rota systems operated on a \u2018knock-for-knock\u2019 basis to make a half-day practicable. A car and a telephone were desirable &#8211; but not essential. If it mattered enough there was always a way of contacting the doctor sooner or later.</div>\n<div>People did not trouble GPs without good cause. If someone phoned I was able to say how urgent was the call and if not very urgent I could finish my supper first and patients respected that you were someone who had a life. I did my own on-call until 2005 when the Government encouraged us to opt out.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\u00a0Most had to pay for the doctor and the medicines. The professional attitude to working class patients was frequently robust, and sometimes downright rude, but this was accepted with tolerance. In middle-class practices there were greater courtesies. However, where I worked in Wales the working classes were respected as their work in the mines and steelworks was tough and the Miners funded the Cottage hospital which had a maternity suite, general ward, operating theatre and a children&#8217;s ward and supplied &#8216;the opening medicine&#8217;( laxatives ) in the form of a delivery of stout each day!</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>There was the ritual preparation of a napkin, a spoon and a glass of water for the doctor\u2019s visit. There might be five shillings (25p) on the mantelpiece for the fee; three and sixpence (17\u00bdp) if the family was not so well off.</div>\n<div>High up the social scale the doctor might be treated as a rather superior type of servant.</div>\n<div>\n<p>Medical diagnosis was often of academic rather than practical importance. Treatment was limited to insulin, thyroid extract, iron, liver extract for pernicious anaemia, digitalis, the new mercurial diuretics, barbiturates, simple analgesics, morphine derivatives and harmless mixtures.</p>\n<p>In my experience medication such as Ipecac et Morph ( for coughs ) or Gentian ( tonic) Mist Pot Citrate ( known as cockles water) for cystitis Mist magnesium trisilicate ( ant- acid for indigestion) ,mandrax and barbiturates for sleeping and intravenous heroin for heart attacks , adrenaline for asthma were medicines I prescribed and administered regularly.<br />\nIt was difficult to keep track of prescribing, all prescriptions were hand written often illegibly and I am sure compliance and abuse was not uncommon.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image71.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-704\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image71.jpg?w=135&#038;h=100\" width=\"135\" height=\"100\" /></a><br />\nRecords were in Lloyd George wallets and belonged to the Secretary of State and for written records this is still the case. electronic records only started to evolve in 2001. Generally record keeping was poor and frequently doctors wrote inappropriate remarks on the notes such as PIN ( pain in the neck ie difficult patient) or a diagnosis of GOK ( God only knows) but this stopped when patients were allowed access to notes after 1990. div&gt;</p>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Entry into a practice was generally by purchase of goodwill, the usual price being one and a half times the annual income.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>GPs started with a substantial debt. On average about 1,000 national insurance patients generated about \u00a3400-\u00a3500 per year, an income boosted by the care of the families who were not covered by national insurance.</div>\n<div>Most \u00a0GP&#8217;s had no pension, waived fees or never received them from poor patients and I they retired due to severe ill- health or died \u00a0they spent the rest of their lives in poverty. A Benevolent Fund was established , fund-raising carried out by doctors wives. I remember it was always on a\u00a0Tuesday afternoon\u00a0\u00a0at \u00a0the doctors house.</div>\n<p>The NHS Act 1946 provided a family doctor to the entire population. The Bill emphasised health centres that were to be a main feature. At public cost, premises would be equipped and staffed for medical and dental services, health promotion, local health authority clinics and sometimes for specialist outpatient sessions. The programme was aborted before it even started.</p>\n<p>Whereas Bevan had persuaded consultants into the service in part by merit awards, the GPs had been unwilling to join until virtually the last moment. The public, however, were encouraged to sign on with those doctors willing to enter the scheme, leaving others with the choice of joining as well or losing their practices. Within a month 90 per cent of the population had signed up with a GP. Twenty thousand GPs joined the scheme as they saw private practice disappear before their eyes.</p>\n<p>The NHS Act made it illegal to sell \u2018goodwill\u2019; instead a fund was established that compensated GPs when they retired, but it was not inflation-linked. The GPs\u2019 contract for a 24-hour service, the nature of the complaints procedures and even the patients\u2019 NHS cards were virtually unchanged (and still are). GPs, fearing that they might be no more than officials in a state service, argued successfully for a contract for services rather than a contract of service. As a result they remained independent practitioners, self-employed and organising their own professional lives. The Spens reports determined pay, which was entirely by capitation.</p>\n<p>GPs\u2019 income depended on the number of their patients; even their expenses were averaged and included in the payment-per-patient. Their independence thus assured, GPs were taxed as though they were self-employed, yet, unlike most people in small businesses, they could not set their fees. With a few exceptions, such as payment for a medical certificate for private purposes, no money could pass between patient and doctor. This system, combined with a shortage of doctors, provided no financial incentive to improve services, but neither was there any incentive to over-treat patients.</p>\n<p>Now many doctors are salaried working for self employed doctors or in PCT(CCG) health centres.</p>\n<p>In 1966 the Royal College of General Practitioners submitted evidence to the Royal Commission on Medical Education. This was to prove of decisive influence in shaping the recommendations of the Commission when they were published in 1968 (Todd Report). The Report made a powerful case for the recognition of general practice as a separate discipline within medicine, requiring its own form of postgraduate training organised by general practitioners. The fulfilment of the College\u2019s work came in 1976 when parliament approved legislation making vocational training a requirement for any doctor seeking to become a principal in general practice and set up new national organisations to administer the act.<br />\nI was one of the first doctors to be selected to be part of a Vocational Training Scheme which took 3 years to complete and involved 6 months in 6 specialities. I worked as a junior doctor in General Medicine/ respiratory medicine, obstetrics &amp; gynaecology, paediatrics, orthopaedics and trauma and ENT and General practise and at the end of this received the post graduate degree MRCGP following an external examination.<br />\nI decided to work for a further year in paediatrics before becoming a Partner in a practise in Maesteg,South Wales.</p>\n<div>I have to say I loved those days in General Practise and \u00a0felt it an honour to serve that community \u00a0and it was with great joy that a bus load of staff and people I worked with \u00a0travelled up to London to my wedding \u00a0when I married my clergyman husband. \u00a0Even though the rumour which went around the Thursday market was that 1 was \u00a0marrying a missionary from East \u00a0Africa rather than \u00a0a vicar from East Acton! Also they were very concerned that I was going to live in London- would I be safe?</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>I did arrive in London to a very different General Practise and I took several years to get used to a multicultural society and a&#8217;part-time service but more conducive to married life!</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image88.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-769\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image88.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></div>\n<div>But as we all keep hearing the world has changed and we are forced to change with it but hopefully we can take the good things from the past recognise vast medical progress. People are more aware of their health and health prevention, communication and recording our work using IT has allowed us to better define the problems we face in order to improve the quality and efficiency of our work. \u00a0We can all be a Dr Tudor Hart recording result as and findings for Dr Foster (\u00a0Dr Foster Intelligence is a provider of healthcare information in the United Kingdom, monitoring the performance of the National Health Service and providing information to the public.[1] It is a joint-venture with the Department of Health and was launched in February 2006.

Also to find out what we are doing well and what we are struggling to do effectively .<br />\nBased on results of this analysis and other audits it has become apparent how costly it is to use secondary(hospital) care if it can be done more or just as effectively and less costly in primary care. however, it is paramount to knock down barriers of communication between hospital and primary care staff and I have seen great changes to improve this. Does a patient need to attend a hospital to hear everything is fine? Blood tests can be carried out in general practise. Type 2 diabetes without complications does not need a specialist diabetic consultant and a mechanical back strain does not need an orthopaedic surgeon to treat. A few examples but there are many more and this has convinced both parties that a more rationale approach is needed to decide where a patient is best managed. Albeit, there are still health professionals out there who are vehemently hanging on to what they have always done but each year they are getting less and -at meetings those voices are disappearing.</p>\n<p><strong>The new NHS is evolving &#8211; the sun is rising.</strong><br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image72.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-705\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image72.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a><br />\nIntegration has been the NHS buzzword of choice in recent years, and unsurprisingly, features heavily in the college\u2019s blueprint for<br />\nprimary care \u2013 The 2022 GP.</p>\n<p>The 20th century model of healthcare \u2013 splitting up hospital andcommunity-based care, as well as health and social care, is \u2018outdated\u2019, the report says.</p>\n<p>\u2018We are moving instead towards a 21st century system of integrated care, where clinicians work closely together in flexible teams, formed around the needs of the patient and not driven by professional convenience or historic location.\u2019</p>\n<p>GPs will increasingly work in federations, leading multidisciplinary teams encompassing nursing and hospital staff, using electronic records to support co-ordination of care.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image74.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-707\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image74.jpg?w=290&#038;h=174\" width=\"290\" height=\"174\" /></a><br />\nContractual arrangements will be varied, with many GPs employed in salaried roles by federations, foundation trusts, and third or private sector providers, alongside independent contractors, the report suggests.</p>\n<p>As the NHS celebrates its 65th birthday, it is entering what the RCGP identifies as a new era.</p>\n<p>Over the next decade, patients will face \u2018more complexity, morechoice and more uncertainty and will rely on the expertise, skill and compassion of their GP like never before\u2019.</p>\n<p>The college has called for 10,000 more GPs and a sharp rise in funding to help the profession absorb the pressure.</p>\n<p>But to remain fit for purpose, it says, general practice must evolve,<br />\nnot simply expand.</p>\n<p><strong>So what is the RCGP\u2019s vision for general practice in 2022 and how<br />\nrealistic is it?</strong></p>\n<p>Adapted GP role</p>\n<p>The RCGP is clear that as part of this shift, \u2018the role of the GP will need to be adapted\u2019. The report, co-authored by RCGP chairwoman Professor Clare Gerada, outlines a vision of the 2022 GP as an \u2018expert generalist\u2019.</p>\n<p>This new breed of GP will be trained to manage increasingly complex patients with chronic conditions and polypharmacy, handling \u2018urgent and routine needs\u2019, and providing \u2018first-contact care to the majority of children and those with mental health conditions\u2019.</p>\n<p>GPs can no longer stick to the 20th century model, in which they are considered \u2018omnicompetent independent doctors\u2019, the RCGP argues. Instead they will need to work \u2018as part of a family of interconnected professionals\u2019 that could include hospital specialists given additional generalist training.</p>\n<p>Many Medical students now do 4 months in General Practise as part of their registration which now takes 2 years. until a few years ago it was 12 months and was 6 months general medicine and 6months general surgery. Two thirds of medical students will become GP &#8216;s.<br />\nDuring the past year we as GP&#8217;s are meeting with specialised consultants to discuss complex patients and consultants are visiting GP&#8217;s to discuss management of particular conditions and communicate which type of patient needs referring.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, GPs will train to take on extended roles in core areas that need \u2018a generalist approach\u2019 \u2013 perhaps care of those with dementia, homeless patients or those in nursing homes.<br />\nThis month care of all nursing home patients in the defined Ealing CCG area has been taken over by a group of GP&#8217;s who will manage the care of residents and be accountable for the standard of care.<br />\nThis model will be extended to other groups of patients if it is successful.</p>\n<p>Complex needs</p>\n<p>Practices will also need to reshape their services to meet the needs of more and more patients with complex chronic conditions.<br />\nForming \u2018micro-teams\u2019 that bring together primary care, social care staff and clinicians from other specialties, such as paediatrics or mental health, could help provide continuity of care to named groups of patients in need of extra support.</p>\n<p>This team-based approach may also provide the solution to rising rates of doctors working part time, the report suggests, through an \u2018increased focus on team-based continuity\u2019 and more \u2018buddying up\u2019 arrangements between doctors.<br />\nThis has been attempted over many years with great resistance but the climate is changing and those not wanting to comply will be under great pressure from CQC inspectors.</p>\n<p>The standard 10-minute appointment slot will become a thing of the past. GPs of the future will offer \u2018flexible lengths of appointments, determined by need\u2019 and will need to \u2018adapt their working day to offer fewer but longer routine appointments for review of patients with complex needs\u2019.</p>\n<p>Online NHS</p>\n<p>A generation of patients brought up with the internet will mean many \u2018will expect to interact with their general practice team virtually\u2019, with traditional face-to-face GP visits \u2018no longer accepted as the default way to access care\u2019.<br />\nWe already use emailing as a a way of communicating with patients and ordering repeat prescriptions. Also more recently patients will check their own blood pressure in a pharmacist, supermarket or using there own machine and having face-to-face much less frequently. Pre-consultation questionnaire will be used to prioritise what needs to addressed in the consultation.<br />\nMy only concern is that opportunistic screening and the doctor- patient relationship will be limited. However, with doctors working less hours and larger practises the norm and finances strained this will be seen as the only way forward.</p>\n<p>Better planning across federated practices will improve co-ordination and continuity of out-of-hours care, although GPs will not be required to offer direct patient-to-doctor access out of hours.</p>\n<p>The RCGP vision also sets out plans to train GPs to have a better \u2018understanding of the needs of their practice population\u2019. This could help shore up the profession\u2019s role in commissioning, amid Labour pressure to hand more control to local authorities.</p>\n<p>Funding</p>\n<p>Professor Gerada and her co-authors acknowledge that without substantial investment to expand the GP workforce and premises, \u2018the vision will be made much more difficult or will become impossible\u2019.<br />\nSmall practises will not be viable and CQC will have the power to lose a surgery that does meet the required standards. This will encourage mergers of small practises but in my opinion it is better to look around and plan this before someone else does. Working in these multidisciplinary groups at present is helping finding like minded GP&#8217;s that can work together. There are some delightful caring young GP&#8217;s in the area who I would have no problem working with and they need to be nurtured.</p>\n<p>Step one is winning the battle of ideas \u2013 an action plan in the report highlights a need to \u2018promote greater understanding of the value generalist care brings to the health service\u2019.</p>\n<p>RCGP council member and deputy GPC chairman Dr Richard<br />\nVautrey believes this battle will be won over time, simply because<br />\nno alternative exists. \u2018It is economically essential for the NHS to be<br />\nbuilt on a primary care base, it\u2019s in politicians\u2019 interest to value it as<br />\nthe way the NHS can survive and thrive long term,\u2019 he says.</p>\n<p>The RCGP vision is realistic, he says, because many of the innovations in the report are already being delivered by GPs in parts of the UK.<br />\nWe have formed a network ( a smaller section of the ECCG consisting of all local practises and meet regularly 1-2 times each month with other health care professionals to discuss complex cases and we have found ways of sharing resources and experiences which have most beneficial in managing patients biopsychosocial needs aswell addressing our own learning needs.</p>\n<p>But he adds: \u2018One concern is that as practices struggle with workload, it is hard to develop in the way they want to, because they don\u2019t have the resources. Resources are crucial.\u2019</p>\n<p>The ball is in the government\u2019s court \u2013 it must invest and build on the innovation and modern working of GPs across the country, or miss out on what The 2022 GP calls \u2018a historic opportunity to harness the power of general practice to transform the health service we will have in 2022\u2019.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image73.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-706\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image73.jpg?w=275&#038;h=183\" width=\"275\" height=\"183\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 660, "location": false, "date": "07-30-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["CCG", "General Practise", "Health", "PDA", "GP"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image51.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-666\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image51.jpg?w=92&#038;h=150\"   /></a><strong>Under the NHS Constitution, you have<br />\n<strong>\u201cthe right to be involved in discussions and decisions about your healthcare, and to be given information to enable you to do this.&#8221;</strong></strong></p>\n<p>There are times when you need to make decisions about your health.

They may wish to take away a copy of the PDA and discuss it with family or friends</p>\n<p>Use of PDA&#8217;s is now recognised nationally and NICE recommended that people should be offered information about their absolute risk of cardiovascular disease and about the absolute benefits and harms of an intervention over a 10-year period.

The local Health Checks programme is delivered by practice nurses and health-care assistants in general practice. Disease-free individuals estimated to be at, or greater than, a 20% 10-year risk of a CVD event were targeted in the first year of the programme (1 September 2008 to 31 August 2009); the method of risk estimation is detailed subsequently.</p>\n<p>The PCT provided each general practice with a list of patients to be invited in year one, and the practice then contacted patients by a letter inviting them to attend a Health Check. Each practice was responsible for completing a full Health Check, including appropriate laboratory tests and reminding non-attendees. The local programme started before the national roll out of NHS Health Checks in April 2009. Ealing went beyond the Department of Health requirements by including patients with diagnosed hypertension and those prescribed statins and commenced screening at the age of 35 years, due to the high burden and earlier onset of CVD and diabetes in the area. CVD risk estimates were based on the informationrecorded in the GP information system in the past 5 years.<br />\nThe screening process has become increasingly sophisticated and those participating will be aware of the process and how other illnesses are taken into account, family history aswell as measurements of blood pressure,cholesterol,blood sugar, weight height and BMI. Exercise as mentioned in a previous blog is calculated by the GPPAQ (<a href=\"http://www.patient.co.uk/doctor/general-practice-physical-activity-questionnaire-gppaq\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.patient.co.uk/doctor/general-practice-physical-activity-questionnaire-gppaq</a>) to determine if a patient is inactive or to what degree they are active and with all this information the cardiovascular risk (the risk of heart attack in the next 10years) is calculated. If a significant risk is identified the patient is seen by the doctor who will discuss treatment options discussing the reasons for treatment and evidence why it should be implemented and allowing the patient to reflect on this referring to a PDA.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image52.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-668\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image52.jpg?w=133&#038;h=75\" width=\"133\" height=\"75\" /></a>The risk is explained in this case using a Cates plot which is the use of 4 face categories to visually indicate the following:</p>\n<p>People not affected by a treatment (green faces for those with a good outcome and red for those with a bad outcome)<br />\nPeople for which treatment changes their category from a bad outcome to a good outcome (yellow faces)<br />\nPeople for which treatment causes an adverse event and changes their category from a good outcome to bad outcome (crossed out green faces)<br />\nIt is important to avoid framing the information, resulting in an unbalanced picture of either benefits or harms.

The first phrase could create greater reassurance, and the second greater concern. Best practice recommends presenting the data in both ways.

As such, they have also undergone the most research.<br />\nThey include:</p>\n<p>patient information leaflets and booklets<br />\nDVDs and audio tapes<br />\ninteractive media and<br />\nweb based tools.</p>\n<p><strong>Brief in-consultation decision aids</strong><br />\nAlthough these are relatively new, healthcare teams have found these brief tools to be extremely valuable in implementing shared decision making in clinical practice.</p>\n<p>The clinical teams at Cardiff have focused on developing and testing Option Grids.<br />\nAn Option Grid is designed for sharing with patients during consultation. It enables the patient to compare the various options available in relation to the factors that are important to them personally.

It is similar to the concept of air pressure in a car tyre.</p>\n<p>The pressure in the arteries depends on how hard the heart pumps, and how much resistance there is in the arteries.<br />\nIt is thought that slight narrowing of the arteries increases the resistance to blood flow, which increases the blood pressure.<br />\nThe cause of the slight narrowing of the arteries is not clear. Various factors probably contribute.</p>\n<p><strong>2) How is it measured?</strong></p>\n<p>A common blood pressure might be 120/80 (said as &#8217;120 over 80&#8242;). These values are quoted in units known as millimeters of mercury (mmHg).</p>\n<p>There are 2 numbers because the blood pressure varies with the heartbeat. The higher pressure (120) represents the pressure in the arteries when the heart beats, pumping blood into the arteries.<br />\nThis pressure is called systolic pressure.</p>\n<p>The lower pressure (80) represents the pressure in the arteries when the heart is relaxed between beats.<br />\nThis pressure is called diastolic pressure.</p>\n<p><strong>3) Does it vary in an individual ?</strong></p>\n<p>Blood pressure can be quite variable, even in the same person.</p>\n<p><strong>4) what makes the blood pressure vary?</strong></p>\n<p>Blood pressure goes up and down with different normal daily activities. For example, exercise, changes in posture and even talking changes blood pressure.</p>\n<p>Blood pressure tends to be higher during the day than at night and higher in the winter than in the summer.</p>\n<p>Blood pressure also rises when we grow older, particularly systolic blood pressure. Before adulthood, blood pressure rises in parallel with height.</p>\n<p>In adult years, weight and blood pressure are closely related. When weight goes up, blood pressure tends to go up and we can lower blood pressure by losing weight.</p>\n<p><strong>5) Does it vary in individuals?</strong></p>\n<p>Blood pressures differ between individuals. Some people have low, some average and some high blood pressure levels.<br />\n<strong><br />\n6) What is the definition of high blood pressure?</strong></p>\n<p>There are various definitions of high blood pressure, which is also known as hypertension, but most doctors consider blood pressures of 140/90 and greater to be high.</p>\n<p>The precise values that doctors might interpret as high blood pressure depend to an extent on individual circumstances. For example, in patients with diabetes, the definition of hypertension is considered by some to be pressures greater than 130/80.</p>\n<p>The definition of hypertension is used by doctors to help decide which patients would benefit from medical (lifestyle and drug) treatment to lower pressure.</p>\n<p>The definitions depend on the balance of risk of not lowering blood pressure (heart attack and stroke, etc) versus the risks of treatment (drug side effects, etc).</p>\n<p>This explains why hypertension is defined at lower blood pressure levels in diabetic subjects. For the same blood pressure, cardiovascular complications (that is damage to the heart, blood vessels and brain) are more likely in diabetics and blood pressure reduction offers benefit even when a diabetic&#8217;s blood pressure is not as high as regular definitions of hypertension.</p>\n<p><strong>7) Why is blood pressure important?</strong></p>\n<p>Blood pressure is important because it is the driving force for blood to travel around the body to deliver fresh blood with oxygen and nutrients to the organs of the body.</p>\n<p>However, high blood pressure is important because it leads to increased risk of serious cardiovascular disease, with complications such as heart attack, heart failure, stroke, kidney failure and blindness.</p>\n<p><strong>8) What is the cause of high blood pressure ?</strong></p>\n<p>For the vast majority of people with high blood pressure no precise explanation is ever found. For this reason, such cases are said to have &#8216;essential&#8217; hypertension.</p>\n<p>These cases are likely to result from a range of factors that could be broadly grouped into genetic and environmental (lifestyle) factors that work together to raise blood pressure.</p>\n<p>Because genes and environmental are shared within families, it is not uncommon for people with high blood pressure to know of relatives with the same condition.</p>\n<p>In a minority of cases of hypertension (less than about 5%) a precise cause can be identified. These include hormonal imbalances and kidney diseases that can result from genetic problems, occasionally tumors (usually benign) and blood vessel narrowing. Doctors are trained to look for signs of these specific conditions, as they are often curable.</p>\n<p>High blood pressure is more common is older age groups and in people with a family history of hypertension. It is also more frequent in those who are overweight. However, high blood pressure can affect young thin people with no family history, so no one should consider himself or herself immune from high blood pressure.</p>\n<p><strong>9) Why is it important to control blood pressure ?<br />\n</strong><br />\nIt is the goal of good clinical practice to reduce high levels of pressure wherever possible in order to reduce the risk of complications such as heart attack and stroke.</p>\n<p><strong>10) How is high blood pressure controlled?</strong></p>\n<p>Changes to lifestyle such as weight loss, reduced salt intake, reduced alcohol consumption or exercise are often the first line of treatment. If these approaches don&#8217;t return blood pressure to acceptable levels then drug treatment is usually required.</p>\n<p><strong>11) How do you know if you have high blood pressure?</strong></p>\n<p>The truth is you cannot know your blood pressure unless you have it measured and every adult should know his or her blood pressure.</p>\n<p>Although headaches and nose bleeds can be the result of very high blood pressure, there are many more innocent causes for these common ailments.</p>\n<p><strong>12) How can you help to control blood pressure?</strong></p>\n<p>A healthy lifestyle and a sensible diet are important. One of the most important things is to keep weight under control. Less weight means lower blood pressure, and it also means less diabetes, less stress on muscles and joints and less stress on the heart.</p>\n<p><strong>13) Can high blood pressure be cured?</strong></p>\n<p>Commonly we hear &#8216;can I stop taking my tablets now&#8217; or &#8216;I have finished the course&#8217;</p>\n<p>It is rare for hypertension to disappear by itself. The general rule is that blood pressure gets higher with time and the risk of complications goes up also.</p>\n<p>Although not &#8216;cured&#8217; as such, modern therapeutic approaches to blood pressure are very effective and generally very safe. However, if treatment is stopped the high blood pressure usually returns reasonably quickly.</p>\n<p><strong>14) What are the effects of high blood pressure?</strong></p>\n<p>Any degree of high blood pressure is associated with increased risk of stroke and heart attack, but the higher the pressure, the higher the risks.</p>\n<p><strong>15) How is high blood pressure treated?</strong></p>\n<p>If blood pressure is persistently 140/90 and greater, then some form of treatment is required, although in the first instance this might be adjustments to lifestyle, such as diet and exercise.</p>\n<p>However, if the blood pressure is repeatedly greater than 160/110, then there is usually a need to begin drug treatment immediately, rather than relying on lifestyle changes alone.</p>\n<p>Sustained blood pressures of over 200/120 are considered potentially dangerous and if associated with for example visual trouble or heart failure they require emergency treatment.</p>\n<p><strong>16) Will hypertension cause any damage to my body?</strong></p>\n<p>Left unchecked, high blood pressure will over the years cause damage to the blood vessels of the heart and brain that leads to heart attacks and strokes. It also places extra strain on the heart, causing thickening of the heart muscle and heart failure and it damages the kidneys and can lead to kidney failure.</p>\n<p><strong>17)Are there any side effects to medication?</strong></p>\n<p>These days drugs are safe and generally free of major side effects, but no drug is completely free of side effects in all patients.</p>\n<p>As blood pressure drugs work by reducing blood pressure, sometimes too great a fall in blood pressure can cause dizziness on standing. This can be a problem in the summer months and especially when rising quickly from squatting. Dizziness on standing also can be worse in older patients.</p>\n<p>There are a variety of other symptoms that can result from blood pressure medications and if these appear in the days or weeks after treatment has begun you should consult your doctor. However, do not stop medications yourself without medical advice, as sometimes the blood pressure will rebound to very high levels that can be dangerous.</p>\n<p><strong>18) Can I measure my own blood pressure?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes but it is advisable to use a machine recommended by the British Hypertension Society(BHS).<br />\nSeek advise from GP,nurse or pharmacist.<br />\nThe machines should be calibrated annually.<br />\nThe following Machines are validated by BHS</p>\n<p>Lloyds Pharmacy LBP 1 *(D) \u00a330.00 International Protocol<br />\nLloyds Pharmacy LBPK 1 *(D) \u00a330.00 International Protocol</p>\n<p><strong>19) Can your risk of stroke or heart attack be calculated</strong>?</p>\n<p>During a consultation when recording blood pressure and other details this can be calculated.</p>\n<p>This risk calculator uses the Framingham risk equation[1] and the adjustments as suggested by the Joint British Societies&#8217; (JBS2) paper[2] and the JBS Cardiovascular Risk Assessor.[3]<br />\nMore details are obtainable on <a href=\"http://www.patient.co.uk\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.patient.co.uk</a> or ask one of the clinicians when you attend the surgery. Those patients who have a high risk are seen more often and offered support regarding their lifestyle ie. diet, exercise,weight loss,smoking cessation</p>\n<p>It is not the only risk calculator in use. In 2010 the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) decided it could no longer recommend that the Framingham risk equation be used, as it tends to over-estimate risk by approximately 5% in UK men.[4] The decision also coincides with the emergence of the QRISK\u00ae calculator which has been shown to predict risk more accurately. The QRISK\u00ae calculator is available at <a href=\"http://www.qrisk.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.qrisk.org</a>. For further information on QRISK\u00ae see our cardiovascular risk assessment article.</p>\n<p><strong>20) What is the Government doing to prevent cardiovascular disease at population level?</strong></p>\n<p>The Government has addressed and continues to address the risk at both the population and individual level. The Department of Health asked the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) to produce public health guidance at population level. This involves multiple agencies and is outlined in the public health guidance PH25 publication.<br />\npublications.nice.org.uk/prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease-ph25</p>\n<p><strong>In summary</strong></p>\n<p>Recommendation include the following:-</p>\n<p><strong>A) Salt</strong><br />\nThe Food Standard Agency has made considerable progress in reducing salt in everyday foods and this continues.<br />\n<strong><br />\nB) Saturated fat</strong><br />\nThe Food Standard Agency, consumers and industry have reduced the population&#8217;s intake (halving the average intake from 14% to 6-7% might prevent 30,000 CVD deaths and prevent a corresponding number of new cases of CVD annually. Eg promoting semi-skimmed milk for children aged over 2 years.</p>\n<p><strong>C) Trans fat</strong><br />\nIndustrially-produced Trans fatty acids (IPTFA) constitute a significant health hazard. Those who regularly eat fried fast-food may be consuming a substantially higher amount of IPTFA . In some countries e.g Denmark ,Austria and New York have successfully banned IPTFA.</p>\n<p><strong>D) Marketing and promotions aimed at children and young people.</strong><br />\nCurrent advertising restrictions have reduced the number of advertisements for foods high in fat,salt or sugar during TV programmes made for children and young people. This policy will be extended.</p>\n<p><strong>E) Commercial interests</strong><br />\nEnsure dealings between government , government agencies and the commercial sector are conducted in a transparent manner that supports public health interests and is in line with best practice. ( including full disclosure of interests)</p>\n<p><strong>F) Product labeling</strong><br />\nClear labeling describing content of food and drink products helping consumers make an informed choice. Evidence shows that simple traffic light labeling works well.</p>\n<p><strong>G) Health impact assessment</strong><br />\nWhere relevant government departments should assess the impact of policies on the health of the population.</p>\n<p><strong>H) Common agricultural policy</strong><br />\nNegotiate at EU and national level to ensure CAP takes account of public health issues.</p>\n<p><strong>I) Physically active travel</strong><em><br />\nEnsure government funding supports physically active modes of travel (such as walking and cycling)</em></p>\n<p><strong>J) Public sector catering guidelines</strong><br />\nTo reduce CVD would be to improve nutritional quality of food provided by public sector organisations.</p>\n<p><strong>K) Take-always and other food outlets</strong><br />\nEmpower local planning authorities to restrict planning permission for these (e.g within walking distance of schools)</p>\n<p><strong>L) Monitoring</strong><br />\nIndependent monitoring using a full range of available data is vital when assessing the need for additional measures to address health inequalities. CVD is responsible for around 33% of the observed gap in life expectancy among people living in areas with the worst health and deprivation indicators compared with those living in other parts of England .</p>\n<p>Recommendations 13-18 provide for a comprehensive regional and local CVD prevention programme. The aim is to plan, develop and maintain effective programmes.</p>\n<p>Recommendations 19-24 expand further on implementing the above and extending it into all public sectors.</p>\n<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>\n<p><strong>THERE ARE USUALLY NO SYMPTOMS FOR HIGH BP </strong></p>\n<p>The risk of stroke is four times greater and the risk of myocardial infarction (a heart attack) two times greater if you have high compared with normal blood pressure.

Hepatitis B and C, which can lead to chronic hepatitis, are particularly prevalent.<br />\nThe five hepatitis viruses have different epidemiological profiles and also vary in terms of their impact and duration. The transmission route depends on the type of virus. Transmission routes that contribute greatly to the spread of hepatitis are exposure to infected blood via blood transfusion or unsafe injection practices, consumption of contaminated food and drinking water, and transmission from mother to child during pregnancy and delivery. Unsafe injection practices, including the use of unsterile needles and syringes, serve as a major pathway for the spread of hepatitis B and C, and reducing transmission of both diseases means changing these practices.<br />\nHepatitis B and C are two such viruses and together kill approximately one million people a year. 500 million people around the world are currently infected with chronic hepatitis B or C and one in three people have been exposed to one or both viruses. Unlike hepatitis C, hepatitis B can be prevented through effective vaccination.</p>\n<p>It is estimated that around 180,000 are affected by hepatitis B in the UK. Around 95 per cent of people with new chronic hepatitis B are migrants, most of whom acquired the infection in early childhood in their country of birth.<br />\nHepatitis C is also a blood-borne viral infection that is transmitted through contact with infected blood. Around 216,000 people in the UK have chronic hepatitis C, and of these 87 per cent are current or past injection drug users. Almost half of the rest are from South Asian descent.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image54.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-674\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image54.jpg?w=620&#038;h=330\" width=\"620\" height=\"330\" /></a></p>\n<p>Together hepatitis B and C represent one of the major threats to global health. Hepatitis B and C are both \u2018silent\u2019 viruses, and because many people feel no symptoms, you could be infected for years without knowing it. If left untreated, both the hepatitis B and C viruses can lead to liver scarring (cirrhosis). If you have liver cirrhosis, you have a risk of life-threatening complications such as bleeding, ascites (accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity), coma, liver cancer, liver failure and death. In the case of chronic hepatitis B, liver cancer might even appear before you have developed cirrhosis.<br />\nWill Irving, Professor and Honorary Consultant in Virology, University of Nottingham and Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, and member of the Programme Development Group, added: &#8220;It is estimated that around half of the individuals living in the UK with chronic hepatitis B or C infection are unaware of their diagnosis, but they are at risk of developing serious complications of their infection.</p>\n<p>While there is a vaccine that protects against hepatitis B infection, there is no vaccine available for hepatitis C<br />\nBoth viruses can be contracted though blood-to-blood contact<br />\nHepatitis B is more infectious than hepatitis C and can also be spread through saliva, semen and vaginal fluid<br />\nIn the case of hepatitis B, infection can occur through having unprotected sex with an infected person. Please note that this is much rarer in the case of hepatitis C<br />\nWhile unlikely, it is possible to contract hepatitis B through kissing. You cannot contract hepatitis C through kissing<br />\nNeither virus is easily spread through everyday contact. You cannot get infected with hepatitis B or C by shaking hands, coughing or sneezing, or by using the same toilet. There are different treatments for the two viruses. While treatment can control chronic hepatitis B, it can often cure hepatitis C<br />\nEven if treatment is not an option it is very important to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Alcohol, smoking, eating fatty foods, being overweight or extreme dieting (eating no food at all) may worsen liver disease.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image55.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-675\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image55.jpg?w=250&#038;h=90\" width=\"250\" height=\"90\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Hepatitis B</strong></p>\n<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) recognises that hepatitis B is one of the major diseases affecting mankind today. Hepatitis B is one of the most common viral infections in the world and the WHO estimates that two billion people have been infected with the hepatitis B virus and approximately 350 million people are living with chronic (lifelong) infections. 500,000 \u2013 700,000 people die every year from hepatitis B.</p>\n<p>It is part of our contract as doctors that we have to have been immunised for Hepatitis B and our immunity is checked by blood test. We also do the same for our nurse and phlebotomist.</p>\n<p>The hepatitis B virus is highly infectious and about 50-100 times more infectious than HIV. In nine out of ten adults, acute hepatitis B infection will go away on its own in the first six months. However, if the virus becomes chronic, it may cause liver cirrhosis and liver cancer after up to 40 years, but in some cases as little as five years after diagnosis.</p>\n<p>The hepatitis B virus is transmitted between people through contact with the blood or other body fluids (i.e. saliva, semen and vaginal fluid) of an infected person.It arises primarily from injecting drug use, heterosexual contact with someone who is infected, travel to countries of intermediate or high endemicity, homosexual contact, and contact with someone in the same household who is a carrier and mother-to-child transmission. Although not all people will have any signs of the virus, those that do may experience the following symptoms:</p>\n<p>Flu-like symptoms<br />\nFatigue<br />\nNausea<br />\nJaundice (yellowing of the skin)<br />\nStomach ache<br />\nDiarrhoea/dark urine/bright stools<br />\nAching joints<br />\nUnlike hepatitis C, there is a vaccine that can prevent infection. If you think you are at risk, you should get vaccinated as soon as possible.</p>\n<p><strong>Hepatitis C</strong></p>\n<p>Hepatitis C is different from hepatitis B in that the virus more frequently stays in the body for longer than six months, and therefore becomes chronic. Four out of five people develop a chronic infection, which may cause cirrhosis and liver cancer after 15\u201330 years. There are approximately 170 million people chronically infected with hepatitis C worldwide. In 2000, the WHO estimated that between three and four million people are newly infected every year.</p>\n<p>Hepatitis C is mainly spread through blood-to-blood contact and, similarly to hepatitis B, there are often no symptoms but if they are present can include:</p>\n<p>Flu-like symptoms<br />\nFatigue<br />\nNausea<br />\nAching muscles and joints<br />\nAnxiety and depression<br />\nPoor concentration<br />\nStomach ache<br />\nLoss of appetite<br />\nDark urine/bright stools</p>\n<p>Although this is considered a global problem we must be aware that this is on our doorstep and now when so many people travel throughout the globe it is imperative that travel immunisation is considered if you wanting to travel or in a high risk occupation.<br />\nIn 2011 there were 160 reports of acute hepatitis B in London, a 13% increase from 141 in 2010. This corresponds to an incidence rate of 2.06 per 100,000 population, which is nearly twice the national rate (England rate 1.13 per 100,000) and nearly double that seen in any other region. The highest rates of acute hepatitis B infection were in Islington, Brent, Newham, Lambeth, Hackney and Tower Hamlets.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image56.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-676\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image56.jpg?w=290&#038;h=174\" width=\"290\" height=\"174\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Do you have concerns?</strong><br />\nIf you have any concerns regarding Hepatitis this can be screened in the practise by an ordinary blood test or it is possible to attend a GUM clinic on Level 8 at Ealing Hospital</p>\n<p>GUM stands for genito-urinary medicine.

You can have a booster injection five years after the initial injection.</strong></p>\n<p>Hepatitis B vaccine on the NHS<br />\nGP surgeries and sexual health or GUM clinics usually provide the hepatitis B vaccination free of charge if you are in an at risk group.<br />\nGPs are not obliged to provide the hepatitis jab on the NHS if you&#8217;re not thought to be at extra risk.<br />\nGPs may charge for the vaccine if you want it as a travel vaccine, or they may refer you to a travel clinic so you can get vaccinated privately. The current cost of the vaccine (in 2013) is around \u00a330 a dose.</p>\n<p>How safe is the hepatitis B vaccine?<br />\nThe hepatitis B vaccine is very safe and other than some redness and soreness at the site of the injection, side effects from it are rare.<br />\nRead more about vaccine safety and side effects.</p>\n<p>Emergency hepatitis B vaccination<br />\nIf you&#8217;ve been exposed to the hepatitis B virus and have not been vaccinated before, you should immediately have the hepatitis B vaccine plus an injection of antibodies called specific hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG). This is because the vaccine doesn&#8217;t work straight away. The immunoglobulin works immediately, albeit temporarily, so you&#8217;re protected until the vaccine starts to work.<br />\nImmunoglobulin should ideally be given within 48 hours, but you can still have the jab up to a week after exposure.</p>\n<p>Babies and hepatitis B vaccination<br />\nBabies born to mothers infected with hepatitis B can be given a dose of the hepatitis B vaccine after they are born. This is followed by another two doses (with a month in between each) and a booster dose 12 months later.<br />\nSome babies also have an injection of immunoglobulin after they are born to help prevent infection.</p>\n<p><strong>HEPATITIS EFFECTS EVERYONE EVERYWHERE: KNOW IT CONFRONT IT AND PROTECT YOURSELF</strong></p>\n", "post_id": 672, "location": false, "date": "07-28-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Postmenopausal", "Kitty heels", "Health", "lifestyle"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image59.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-684\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image59.jpg?w=300&#038;h=114\" width=\"300\" height=\"114\" /></a>This weekend \u00a0I had the good fortune to attend a lovely wedding in London. It was the wedding of the first work experience student who sat with me &gt; 10 years ago. Now qualified and making excellent progress in the medical profession she was marrying another doctor in The Temple Church and this was followed by a river trip to the location of the reception.</p>\n<p>A very special occasion and as the only guests that I knew were more than half my age (friends of my daughter) one of those wedding suits and hat for a senior guest would seem inappropriate, \u00a0so aided by some eager, \u00a0enthusiastic, young shop assistants I finally found a dress that they all thought suited me ( not necessarily what I would chosen but then clothes shopping is not my favourite occupation!).</p>\n<p>Then the assistant appeared with shoes with &#8216;Kitty heels&#8217; and suggested that if I was going to a wedding that heels were a must. As I put them on they surprisingly fitted \u00a0but I have to say I did feel anxious being that much off the ground! I strutted nervously and unsteadily a few steps across the shop and decided I must conquer this and after all I did have a week to practise. Luckily (as you will find out later) they \u00a0had sold out of matching clutch bags. ( a picture representation)<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image60.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-685\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image60.jpg?w=300&#038;h=282\" width=\"300\" height=\"282\" /></a></p>\n<div>Each day that week I practised walking around my home and the surgery, \u00a0but still fearful of venturing out in the street. I thought the best thing was to try going to post a letter and I managed to get back in one piece. My main fear was falling or turning on my ankle. I have previously had a minor fracture of a bone in the ankle \u00a0just stepping from a kerb in flat shoes \u00a0so I am aware of the dangers of a postmenopausal women risks of broken bones.</div>\n<div>I realised that although with the help of my freedom pass I could travel to the church in Central \u00a0London by tube there would be some walking involved. I decided that in no way would I have the courage to walk in Kitty heels any further than the nearest bus stop and \u00a0I must leave plenty of time, the only answer was to carry some flat shoes with me as back up. I hadn&#8217;t bought my matching bag so now I must look for a matching bag with enough room for flat shoes. I found the bag , not quite a portmanteau, \u00a0 packed the shoes and \u00a0carried my fascinator&#8230;..</div>\n<div>I stepped off the train found the stairs not too bad but then I stepped on to the street; I had not bargained for cracks around the pavement slabs and all I could see were the \u00a0cracks and the fear of getting the heel stuck overwhelmed me and I went back to my childhood stepping from slab to slab avoiding the cracks whilst women scurried past me with heels twice the height and not a fear in sight. I steered myself to the side of the pavement and as discretely as possible changed my shoes.</div>\n<div>My next challenge was to find my way to the church, \u00a0no problem I thought as I have a sat nav on the phone. When I had circled the tube station \u00a0once \u00a0if not twice I stopped a tourist who directed me by showing me the way on his Chinese map of London! I walked briskly in my flat shoes and then when I saw the church I stopped around the corner put on my Kitty heels and my fascinator, \u00a0braced myself to walk confidently towards the church. Oh no, the road I had to walk on was cobbled- this was a real test. Gingerly I walked up the path to the church now on tip toe and waiting outside were these stunningly beautiful young men and women I had known so well for almost 20 years. I had given them lifts home from a variety of venues some more dubious than others, fed them, hosted them in sleep overs, \u00a0given them admin work when they were students, \u00a0listened to their gossip their hopes and fears found their cigarette stubs and empty bottles. Along with my own children they warned me which stations were no go areas at night, which lines to avoid and which taxi service to choose to be safe and how to avoid it getting hijacked and much more. \u00a0Now they had blossomed into handsome, attractive and vibrant \u00a0young people working as doctors, managers, lawyers, journalists, film makers, financiers, and teachers around the globe.</div>\n<div>They greeted me with</div>\n<div>\u00a0&#8221; Hello, Dr Bayer \u00a0I love your dress and those shoes are georgeous!&#8221; &#8221; Thank you &#8221; \u00a0I replied, smiled but thinking to myself how much I would love to put those flat shoes on!</div>\n<div>The service was beautiful the music amazing and now as I had been sitting with the young set I was told we now have to lead everybody to the boat to take us down the Thames so we must not hang around and get going. \u00a0I then braced myself and followed them trying to look confident and fearless. I reached the boat intact and slumped into a seat with a cup of tea kicked off the shoes nonchalantly and relaxed for the trip.</div>\n<div>Finally we reached the destination and as I looked out of the window I viewed the long jetty \u00a0to the bank. Then I realised that it was made of decking with cracks between every board. It took only three steps for my kitty heels to be stuck twice needing aid from helpful male boatmen to prize the shoe out. I thought 20-30metres of this was not an option especially as there were tens of people behind me so I simply had to smile elegantly take them off and skip along to the end \u00a0with panache. \u00a0Unfortunately 20 mins prior to this we had had the only rain shower in many weeks so my feet were a little damp!</div>\n<div>At the end of the jetty I put back the shoes and walked through the gate across the newly watered lawn \u00a0and discovered how heels sink in soft earth!</div>\n<div>At last I arrived at the venue and greeted the parents of the bride \u00a0who were poised and elegantly dressed \u00a0and they dutifully said thank you for coming and \u00a0commented that that they had heard a lot about me. That left me wondering what they had heard?</div>\n<div>I was then placed next to retired GP&#8217;s who were \u00a0bemused \u00a0as to why I hadn&#8217;t given up work and \u00a0that I was still getting some job satisfaction and were envious I had such a great partner who was so supportive at this time of my life. \u00a0As we get older it is so important to stand back, hold on to those solid ideals but capture the blind enthusiasm of youth and allow them to find new or reinvent old ideas to manage the present and the future.</div>\n<div>I thought it prudent to leave before the dancing to avoid a potential \u00a0&#8216; kitty heel &#8216; disaster!</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>It was an uplifting experience and a joy to see a group of young people working hard, enthusiastic, travelling from all corners of the earth to reunite on this special occasion.</div>\n<div>By coincidence I sat near\u00a0a young GP \u00a0who was now working in the practise where my family belonged in a Nottinghamshire village where I grew up and I was able to reminisce \u00a0about my formative years and how things had changed..</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\u00a0One of the highlights was an abridged Persian( Iranian)Aghd ceremony of marriage and a Persian senior member read beautiful poetry in Farsi and English during the ceremony two pieces of crystallized sugar (shaped like cones) are rubbed together, a symbolic act to sweeten the couple\u2019s life together bride and groom feed each other honey symbolising a better and sweeter life. following this there was sharing of Persian delicacies to demonstrate the hospitality so typical of a middle Eastern culture.It is so important to be aware of these ancient ceremonies so that we can understand the futures of those we live amongst.<br />\nmore at: <a href=\"http://www.iranchamber.com/culture/articles/iranian_marriage_ceremony.php#sthash.MOAddglL\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.iranchamber.com/culture/articles/iranian_marriage_ceremony.php#sthash.MOAddglL</a><br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image61.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-686\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image61.jpg?w=300&#038;h=206\" width=\"300\" height=\"206\" /></a></div>\n<div></div>\n<div>The reason I wrote this blog because wearing Kitty heels reminded me of how vulnerable you can be if you set out unprepared at this stage in your life. \u00a0I want to remind those postmenopausal women or if you are inviting a postmenopausal woman to join you \u00a0how the fear of falling can be a reality and a fractured femur, ankle or simply a fall can spoil not only a \u00a0great day out but much more.</div>\n<div>Central London is on our doorstep and there is lots to see and experience but go prepared, \u00a0take the lead from those who know it well.

I haven&#8217;t seen her for ages but she called around and asked if I knew a doctor who wasn&#8217;t frightened of Dragons and could see her and I thought you would just the doctor,&#8221;said Denis.</div>\n<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image67.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-698\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image67.jpg?w=250&#038;h=226\" width=\"250\" height=\"226\" /></a></p>\n<div>&#8220;Do come in and tell me what the \u00a0problem is&#8221; I said</div>\n<div>Polly started to cry real dragon tears, &#8221; I have lost all my dragon scales and I can&#8217;t stop scratching as my skin is so&#8230;..oo \u00a0itchy and now none of my friends \u00a0want to play with \u00a0me except Denis&#8221;</div>\n<div>&#8220;Oh Polly don&#8217;t be too sad \u00a0I am sure I can help you.&#8221; \u00a0I looked carefully at her skin and the worst patches were behind her knees \u00a0and elbows and in other creases including under her chin. \u00a0&#8220;Doctors \u00a0call this \u00a0eczema which is sometimes caused by allergy \u00a0but often we don&#8217;t \u00a0know why. We must try and help you but you will have to listen very carefully and do what I say:-</div>\n<div>Firstly you will have to stop using soaps, bubble baths or anything like that.</div>\n<div>Then I will give you some special soft Dragon cream ( an emollient \u00a0such as Ultrabase, Diprobase, Dermol , Epaderm or Cetraban ) which comes either in a big pot or a bottle with a pump. It is VERY important that you don&#8217;t put your claws in the pot because if you do you will get germs in the cream and cream with germs in will make your skin much worse especially as the skin is so cracked. It is your cream and it is only you ,Polly that can use it so, Denis you cannot share it. Perhaps you could put a sticker on pot with your name on.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image65.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-696\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image65.jpg?w=300&#038;h=136\" width=\"300\" height=\"136\" /></a></div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<p>If you have a pot you can use the handle of a spoon or spatula to scoop it out and put on your skin. You will need help from your mummy to put it on the places you can&#8217;t reach. Always put the dragon cream on in the direction of tour scales( in humans the direction of the hair) and don&#8217;t rub up and down because it will make you itch more. Perhaps you can play some quiet music or watch one of your favourite videos whilst she does it just something to make you feel calm and happy.</p>\n<div></div>\n<div>You must put this cream over the whole body and use plenty of it and do this 3 or even 4 times a day. If you feel itchy put some more on and perhaps you can have a small tube or pot to put on by yourself.</div>\n<div>Also you can use this as a soap and in the shower or bath.</div>\n<div></div>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.eczema.org/uploads/BAhbBlsHOgZmIjUyMDEzLzA2LzI4LzIxXzE4XzI5XzIzNF9FbW9sbGllbnRzX0p1bmVfMjAxMy5wZGY?format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.eczema.org/uploads/BAhbBlsHOgZmIjUyMDEzLzA2LzI4LzIxXzE4XzI5XzIzNF9FbW9sbGllbnRzX0p1bmVfMjAxMy5wZGY?format=pdf</a>.

Although I had <em><em>attended a first aid course</em> a few years ago, I found that the quality and content of this one, was superior. The course covered a range of topics including CPR, care of the unconscious patient, choking, anaphylaxis and heart attacks, with plenty of opportunities to practice and get involved. I found the use of a dummy to practice CPR particularly useful as was the discussion of the realistic scenarios one might face and the best course of action to take. This is something, that was certainly lacking in the course I attended previously. The interaction with the other members of the audience was also very useful. Since a number of staff members, doctors and nurses from the avenue and other surgeries attended, I had the opportunity to hear of their opinions and methods when it comes to first aid. Overall I found the course very insightful, helpful and satisfying. I would strongly recommend it to everyone be it healthcare professionals or patients. The skills you learn can literally make the difference between life and death.<br />\nI think that it&#8217;s wonderful that the surgery is allowing patients to attend these courses. I think this is a wonderful opportunity for everyone and the price is extremely competitive to the say least. I will most certainly be looking out for any other courses like this that might be available.</em></em></p>\n<p>Thank you to this patient for sending me their comments.

Nobody could comprehend that an adult could intentionally harm a child and he was looked upon scornfully.<br />\nHowever, a stream of physicians drew attention to the abusive origin to some of these injuries but it wasn&#8217;t until 1962 that the publication of the blockbuster article \u201cThe Battered-Child Syndrome\u201d by pediatrician Henry Kempe and his col- leagues. Kempe played a leading role in bringing child abuse to national attention during the 1960s and 1970s.</p>\n<p>When I trained, child abuse was only mentioned and signs of detection were not formally taught. I started as a paediatric junior doctor in 1978/9 and my way of learning was at that time.<br />\nSeveral babies and children were admitted with suspicious injuries but only in one case was court action taken. Onevbaby was admitted at least 3 times and always the parents had some explanation but it did not tie in with the injuries. The baby was investigated for any possible medical reason- these investigations in themselves often not pleasant. I remember the Local authority lawyer turning up to question doctors; he was elderly, vague and dressed like a farmer in contrast to the parent&#8217;s lawyer who was young, bright and slickly dressed. We all despaired we didn&#8217;t stand a chance of proving the case. Ironically, the baby was admitted again and for some reason the father broke down and admitted exactly what happened.<br />\nIt was not long after this when the consultant discussed with us child abuse and what to look out for that I was able to involved directly with the worse case I have ever witnessed. This remains indelible of my mind and will rest with me forever.<br />\nI was called to A&amp;E to see a child who had &#8216;fallen downstairs&#8217;.<br />\nWhen I entered the cubicle I was in the process of examining a child who was seriously ill, infact dying and as I proceeded to look over her she gasped her last breath. I shall never forget her pale complexion, her soft flaxen hair and the look on her face &#8211; a beautiful young child only 3 years of age.<br />\nMy registrar who was present immediately called the Police surgeon, who I knew well as he was a GP who worked in the practise where I had done my placement. When he realised this was a clear cut case of physical abuse he immediately called the Coroner but in passing told me that although I would be off duty and this would not be a pleasant experience that I should attend the Post-Mortem. It was not long before the Coroner arrived clad in formal evening dinner dress and even wearing a black cloak then he was followed by the the pathologist. There was an eerie silence as the men, who had only a short time ago been laughing and happily merrymaking were now stunned to silence with what lay before their eyes. I was introduced to the Coroner who briefly acknowledged my presence and I sheepishly took my place against the wall to observe the proceedings. These men beavered away carefully examining the small child and recording everything fastidiously. Laurence( the Police Surgeon) whispered asides to let me know the significance of every sign and I remained speechless. I didn&#8217;t write anything down as the pictures would be stored in my internal photoshop indefinitely.</p>\n<p>Incredibly, this case never reached the Local let alone the National newspapers or the media probably because it was still considered inconceivable and I have no idea whether there was a prosecution I am doubtful. I like many others were part of the denial despite seeing and feeling the evidence. I recall it with great feeling and deep sadness.</p>\n<p>When I was a student I helped on a voluntary basis in a local children&#8217;s home and remember how I went before the &#8216;matron&#8217; to air my concerns about potential abuse. She was horrified and dismissed me and told me never to return.This was my experience of being ignored and dismissed out of hand and no comparison to the many thousands of witnesses and victims ignored by those they addressed with worries or claims. I realised how this horrendous problem can be concealed and how people knowingly or unknowingly keep it hidden.</p>\n<p>It was in 2006/7 when I was working with the Atos as an EMP(Examining Medical Physician) in Bromyard avenue examing claimants who had been off sick for a prolonged period and were claiming, at that time &#8216;Sickness Benefit&#8217;. A lean gentleman in his late 50&#8242;s was the next customer (as they were called) entered and I routinely asked him why he was off sick. He then proceeded to explain that he had been in prison for most of his adult life. Infact, when he entered the army as a young man he had been sent to Military prison for assault but when he had been summoned to his officer to explain himself had tipped the table against him pinning him to the wall. Following this he was dismissed from the army sent to Wormwood Scrubs category B men&#8217;s prison. This was the story of his life in and out of prison and hating any form of authority. He was therefore unemployable but now he had a malignant cancer. As I listened I could feel the tangible emotion of despair and frustration and self hate but in no way did I feel threatened or intimidated.<br />\nI then asked him &#8216;what do you enjoy doing most?&#8217; Simply as a way of attempting to complete the medical and understand what he could do. His reply was quite a surprise and tears welled up in my eyes when he replied in a calm genle manner looking up to the ceiling, &#8216;sitting peacefully alone in the Park watching he birds&#8217; Somehow, I had pressed a button and he then began to tell me his life story totally without punctuation. He related how he was brought up on a farm in Ireland and had been sent away to school (a school run by the infamous Christian Brothers) then relating how they serially physically and sexually abused the boys on entry to the school and persistently afterwards. As he told the story he became that small child again flinching visibly as he described how he was whipped repeatedly. He acted as if it was happening at that moment and then started peering out of the window describing the horrors of physical and sexual abuse he had witnessed those many years ago. He told me how he told his parents and the priest and they had punished him for making such a terrible accusation. As I listened, pen now fallen to the floor as I was too numb to record anything. I acknowledged his need to express how he felt and tell the tale he needed to tell. He then told me of one of the boys who was very intelligent and had vowed to the other boys that he would study hard and become a lawyer and expose these perpetrators and eventually that same boy did qualify as a lawyer and was now in a position to gather evidence and expose these people once and for all. This lawyer had approached this customer to be a witness but sadly he felt with his criminal record his story would have no validity. I had become that person for him to tell and to listen to his evidence. As he took a breath I told him I believed him implicitly and he didn&#8217;t need to say more and with that he rose to his feet and took flight and sped rapidly down the road into the abyss as if free at last.<br />\nGreatly disturbed by this consultation ,I requested that I could speak to one of my colleagues who listened sensitively and allowed me to debrief. It was a few years later that the full scandal was released in the press. A childhood of abuse, a lifetime of suffering and frustration in not being able to trust anyone especially those in positions of authority or trust. I felt absolutely impotent all I could do was listen and hope whatever time he had left on earth could be peaceful just watching the birds.</p>\n<p>These 2 experiences have made a lasting impression but account for why I strongly feel that we should all be responsible safeguarding our children. It is why I always try to show an open door to any new mother even if the reason for the visit is trivial and I like to see them during their pregnancy in order to give them support and khelp if coping is a problem. Having a child is an amazing experience and privilege and with all the will in the World we don&#8217;t always get it right and we cannot predict what stresses will prevail.<br />\n&#8220;life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you&#8217;ll get&#8221; forrest gump?<br />\nThere are provisions in place for support to families who are not coping in any form and contact with them could prevent a Tradegy.</p>\n<p><strong>SAFE &#8211; Supportive Action for Families in Ealing</strong></p>\n<p>Ealing Local authority has a team which is made up of psychologists, therapists, counsellors, pupil/ school workers, family workers and other experts.

We are CRB checked and even if we work in another setting eg Out of Hours we must have a CRB check. I have made my own children aware from an early age even if they were babysitting in their teens and emphasised to the parents and them how they must call me if the child is not easily pacified. Infact, when my daughter was in the surgery several years ago doing somee light administrative work as a student,she reported a concern she had observed and this was taken up by Social Services and the child was put on the &#8216;At Risk Register&#8217; and the mother was given support and practical help whilst under great personal stress and the child was able to remain with the mother.</p>\n<p>Where I work in Hillingdon Urgent Care Centre whenever a child of under 16 years is seen it is necessary to report who brought the child and you as the doctor satisfied there are no child protection concerns. It is fixed in my mind to do the same every time I see any child. All attendances of children are viewed by the health visitors and followed up if appropriate.</p>\n<p>Please familiarise yourself with warning signs as everyone has direct for indirect contact with children and report as suggested or talk to one of us in surgery- it will always be considered highly confidential and dealt with sensitively.<br />\nWe are <strong>ALL</strong> responsible for the welfare of children in our midst.</p>\n", "post_id": 741, "location": false, "date": "08-01-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["stress", "immunisation", "shingles", "Health", "herpes zoster", "Chickenpox", "health benefits"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/image4.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-758\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/image4.jpg?w=275&#038;h=183\" width=\"275\" height=\"183\" /></a><a href=\"//0\"><br />\nSeptember 1st</a>\u00a0 marks the arrival of a vaccine for people aged 70 years (routine cohort) and 79 years (catch-up cohort) to protect against shingles The efficacy of the vaccine declines with age and so it is not recommended for people aged 80 years or older.<br />\nThe brand name of the shingles vaccine given in the UK is Zostavax</p>\n<p>Unlike the flu jab, you&#8217;ll only need to have the vaccination once.<br />\nThe vaccine is expected to reduce your risk of getting shingles. If you are unlucky enough to go on to have the disease, your symptoms may be milder and the illness shorter.<br />\nIt&#8217;s difficult to be precise, but research to date suggests the shingles vaccine will protect you for at least three years, probably longer.<br />\nThere is lots of evidence showing that the new shingles vaccine is very safe. It&#8217;s already been used in several countries, including the US and Canada, and no safety concerns have been raised. The vaccine also has few side effects.</p>\n<p><strong>What is Shingles?</strong><br />\nShingles or Herpes Zoster is a debilitating condition, which occurs more frequently and tends to be more severe in older people. It is estimated that around 250,000 people are affected in England and Wales each year, including 30,000 people in their 70s. Around one in 1,000 people over 70 who get shingles dies of the infection.</p>\n<p>About 1 in 5 people have shingles at some time in their life. It can occur at any age, but it is most common in people over the age of 50. It is uncommon to have shingles more than once, but about 1 person in 50 has shingles two or more times in their life.</p>\n<p>Most people have chickenpox ( varicella Zoster)in childhood, but after the illness has gone, the virus remains dormant (inactive) in the nervous system. The immune system (the body\u2019s natural defence system) keeps the virus in check, but later in life it can be reactivated and cause shingles.<br />\nIt is not known exactly why the shingles virus is reactivated at a later stage in life, but it may be due to having lowered immunity (protection against infections and diseases). This may be the result of:<br />\nbeing older<br />\nbeing stressed<br />\na condition that affects your immune system, such as HIV and AIDS<br />\nDebilitation associated with cancer or medication affecting the immune system.</p>\n<p>Each spinal nerve supplies an area of skin called a dermatome.

It is the tear [that results] from the injury of the oyster. The treasure of our being in this world is also produced by an injured life. If we had not been wounded, if we had not been injured, then we will not produce the pearl.&#8221; Stephen Hoeller<br />\nOver the years I have seen a huge variety of people with depression, head teachers, lawyers, research scientists, doctors, infact people of all ages from all walks of life. They all present with hopelessness and dwindling lack of interest in life and I see it as my job to help them discover a gleam of hope in order to work themselves out of this painful state.<br />\nThey usually claim they have tried everything but nothing works, they don&#8217;t trust anyone and they don&#8217;t see a way forward.<br />\nHowever, as I reflected on the different people I have seen over the years and followed them up I feel uplifted by the fact that most of them have emerged out of this state to be happier, more fulfilled people and have turned around their lives in a positive way and this empowers me to feel hopeful about true recovery.<br />\nSomething that I have suggested on many occasions that has been a help to some people is a simple idea based on the fact that collecting lots a minute pieces of positive experiences that would normally go unnoticed can subtly create a gleam of hope.<br />\nThese minute positive experiences could be some food that tasted pleasant, making a note of a random smile from someone, the sun shining or simply a ray of sunshine through a crack, a pleasing picture or piece of music, anything that Seems momentarily pleasing. Saving a bus ticket, wrapper or newspaper cutting or putting a word on a scrap of paper as a reminder and then saving them in a &#8216; chocolate box&#8217; or equivalent and putting the box in a drawer( I suggest an underwear drawer &#8211; somewhere private) and to get the box out on a black day and trawl through these personal items.It is surprising how these minute events mount up in a short time and the overall effect can make life seem less hopeless.<br />\nWhen this gleam of hope is found and this may take a variable length of time and may need several consultations to build up a mutual trust in working together then a patient can embark on the 7 steps of recovery.</p>\n<p>1)firstly in depression aswell as other chronic illness,it is important <strong>to accept help from people who really want to help us</strong>, from people who are really interested in our problems and listen to us, not just because it is their duty as doctors, but because they really want to help, and those people prescribe us medication, give us advice, and cognitive therapy. Allow yourself to accept such help, as it is genuine.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image84.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-735\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image84.jpg?w=300&#038;h=194\" width=\"300\" height=\"194\" /></a><br />\n2) that you have <strong>to understand yourself.</strong> Meditation, yoga, anything. And above all, ask yourself, why did this mental illness occur? If you can answer this question, and I am sure you can, then this is already a great step forward.<br />\nWe are now talking about the concept of mindfulness which I will be writing a separate blog shortly.</p>\n<p>3)<strong>Change your eating habits</strong>.<br />\nWe know that omega-3 fatty acids have innumerable health benefits. Recently, scientists have revealed that a deficit of omega-3 fatty acids is associated with depression. In one study, researchers determined that societies that eat a small amount of omega-3 fatty acids have a higher prevalence of major depressive disorder than societies that get ample omega-3 fatty acids. Other studies show that people who infrequently eat fish, which is a rich source of omega-3 fatty acids, are more likely to suffer from depression.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/image11.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-778\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/image11.jpg?w=236&#038;h=300\" width=\"236\" height=\"300\" /></a><br />\nSources of omega-3 fatty acids: fatty fish (anchovy, mackerel, salmon, sardines, shad, and tuna), flaxseed, and nuts.<br />\nSources alpha-linolenic acid (another type of omega-3 fatty acid): flaxseed, canola oil, soybean oil, walnuts, and dark green leafy vegetables.<br />\nAlso it has been found that people with low Vitamin D and or folic acid (spinach and advocado) tend to be more depressed.</p>\n<p>4) We also need to <strong>change the way we communicate with others.</strong><br />\nAs one psychiatrist quoted,<br />\n&#8220;When a patient tells me his wife nags him I tell him to turn the tables on her. When she says: &#8221;look at you in front of the TV again watching too much TV Football leaving me to do the washing up once more&#8221;, stand up and say:\u00abyou are right dear, I will do the washing up today.&#8221;<br />\nI think she will feel weak at the knees and you will gain something, because you have surprised her and, by doing so you have gained, and become more charming because you reacted differently. When the patient comes to me the following week he says: &#8221;I surprised her, but I didn&#8217;t do the washing up&#8221;.&#8221;<br />\nI have used this in consultations using personal situations. Many years ago I remember this series of consultations.<br />\nMr T had been going on holiday by himself for a few years because his wife was too miserable and depressed and I suspected he was depressed but in denial. When she went in hospital he came to have a routine blood pressure and complained how his wife was in hospital and even more miserable. She had seen me before going into hospital and complained as to how unsympathetic and miserable he was and how glad he was going on holiday by himself. (As patient confidentiality is paramount in any consultation neither party knew I had consulted the other.)<br />\nWhen I saw Mr T I suggested that it would be good if he took her flowers when he went to see her although it was something he had not done in many years.<br />\nWhen I saw Mrs T after she was discharged I reviewed her and she then said with a smile on her face &#8220;guess what doctor, my husband visited me in hospital and he brought me flowers!&#8221; I replied &#8221; how lovely, I hope you said &#8216;thank you&#8217; &#8221; she replied, &#8221; oh dear, I don&#8217;t think I did&#8221;<br />\nWhen Mr T consulted again he said, &#8221; I did what you said doctor and eventually she even said &#8216;thank you&#8217;!<br />\nWhen I consulted them a few months later each one in turn gave me a bar of chocolate from Spain and reported how they had had a nice holiday together.<br />\nOn each occasion I just smiled and later shared the chocolate with my family when they greeted me in the evening with &#8220;late again for supper,mum&#8221;!</p>\n<p>5)We all need to find a <strong>better balance between work and leisure,</strong> find another pattern. Some of us have a pattern of 20 hours to 4 hours. It would be much better to have a pattern of 20 minutes to 4 minutes. Or better still 4 hours: 1 hour. Changing the rhythm doesn&#8217;t mean that you have to work less, just change the rhythm. Otherwise you risk burnout.<br />\nI often suggest to those people, who adamantly claim that they have to work late every night, to choose one or preferably 2 days a week to leave &#8216;on time&#8217;. The first week colleagues will question this &#8216;leaving early are you?&#8217; But hold the head up high and leave with no reason given. The second week on leaving &#8216;on time&#8217; the comments may be &#8216;leaving early again&#8217; and again leave with head held up high and no reason given. The third week as you linger dreading a comment it will probably be &#8216;isn&#8217;t it today you leave early?&#8217; It works and can be a chance to develop space for leisure even a quiet undisturbed cup of tea or a walk in the park.</p>\n<p>6)<strong>Change your interaction with nature</strong>. To those of you who enjoy being outdoors I say: &#8221;What do you think about when you for a walk in the park . About your problems. Why? Why is this wrong? Because every muscle cell has a memory. When we do stomach exercises, all our stomach cells are attuned to work with us . When we do push-ups, all our cells do push-ups. If we think about our problems every time we run uphill, then our cells will be full of problems whenever we run uphill. So, when we get depressed, somatisation causes pain in all those cells. It&#8217;s very simple. Every cell has a memory. I suggest that it is a good idea to change &#8211; go to Tai Chi before going for a run or alternatively concentrate on something else. When you run, imagine yourself in an ideal situation with the perfect partner, the perfect job or in a dream location.<br />\nChange your interaction with nature. If you used to go mountaineering take up caving, jogging take up rambling.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/image32.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-833\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/image32.jpg?w=300&#038;h=199\" width=\"300\" height=\"199\" /></a><br />\nTake a trip to &#8216;Lammas Park or Walpole Park instead of Pitshanger Park. In short: make a change, because by doing this you will move from West Ealing to another place. Even if only for half an hour a day.<br />\n&#8220;Trying something new alters the levels of dopamine, which is associated with pleasure, enjoyment, and learning.&#8221;</p>\n<p>7)What is most important?</p>\n<p>For me the most important thing is to change your attitude towards music and dance. Listen to music for fun, sing or hum along with it with ear phones or in the shower if you don&#8217;t want to upset the neighbours. Sing in the car on your own, with your partner or children with feeling and passion!! Great on the school run&#8230;</p>\n<p>Dance on you own, with your partner or children or your imaginary partner!<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image78.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-729\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image78.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a><br />\nDance to have fun try &#8216;strictly come dancing&#8217; or karaoke in your own home \u00a0or wherever&#8230; If you used to dance the Foxtrot, then dance the Waltz.

There are two major categories of garlic in France\u2014that planted in spring and that planted in the autumn. Both are harvested in July. One of the more distinctive varieties is the mild ail rose de Lautrec, with a rigid central stem that makes it impossible to braid and the heavy bouquets are seen hanging from the stall&#8217;s canopy.<br />\nAlthough my introduction to the use of garlic in cooking was when I lived in Wales.<br />\nWe associate garlic with the French and I remember when I was in Cardiff every week the &#8216;Shoni winwns man&#8217;(Onion Johnnies) stood against their bicycles selling red garlic and onions at the market. <a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/image20.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-802\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/image20.jpg?w=212&#038;h=300\"   /></a>They had brought their bicycles and onions from Roscoff, Brittany and conversed quite happily with the Welsh speaking customers as both the Breton and Welsh language have many similarities. These men disappeared fro the streets in about 2002 after 175yrs of trading.<br />\nGarlic is used in French cooking but also used chopped raw and added to lettuce as part of a meal or on bread with butter. It is often mixed with parsley which tends to neutralise the breath. This makes French green beans taste even better.<br />\nInterestingly, the other countries that use large amounts of garlic in their cooking are Italy and China.</p>\n<p>When I read an article in the news this week that garlic had potentially healing and preventative properties in lung cancer this did not come as a surprise.</p>\n<p>A previous study at the University of South Australia concluded that garlic could decrease the risks of bowel tumors by as much as a third, while other studies have found that garlic can help to repress common colds and assist with inflammation with its anti-bacterial properties. This natural antibiotic is effective against toxic bacteria, viruses, and fungus.</p>\n<p>Garlic has been shown to be beneficial for the heart in that it lowers blood pressure and thins the blood by reducing the platelet cells stickiness. It lowers serum triglycerides and LDL-cholesterol ( the bad type) levels and increases serum HDL-cholesterol (the good type) and fibrinolysis (the process through which the body breaks up blood clots.)</p>\n<p>Previous studies have also suggested garlic can protect the lungs against various conditions as it acts as an expectorant but also Garlic is known to stimulate T-lymphocyte and macrophage action, promote interleukin-1 levels, and support natural killer cells. Strong activity of these key cells promotes healthy immune system function, and strengthens the body&#8217;s defenses.</p>\n<p>In the latest investigation, scientists at Jiangsu Provincial Centre for Disease Control and Prevention compared 1,424 lung cancer patients with 4,500 healthy adults.</p>\n<p>Each one was questioned on their dietary and lifestyle habits, including how often they consumed garlic and whether they smoked.<br />\nThe results, published online in the journal Cancer Prevention Research, showed those who ate raw garlic at least twice a week were significantly less likely to get lung cancer, even if they smoked or were exposed to high-temperature cooking oil fumes, which is thought to be another trigger for the disease.<br />\nIt&#8217;s not clear whether cooked garlic would have the same effect.<br />\nPrevious research suggests the key ingredient seems to be a chemical called allicin, released when the clove is crushed or chopped.<br />\nIt is thought to dampen down inflammation in the body and act as an anti-oxidant, reducing damage from so-called free radicals to the body&#8217;s cells.</p>\n<p>In the case of colon cancer substances such as allicin, have been shown not only to protect colon cells from the toxic effects of cancer-causing chemicals but also to stop the growth of cancer cells once they develop.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/image21.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-803\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/image21.jpg?w=300&#038;h=220\" width=\"300\" height=\"220\" /></a></p>\n<p>Adults regularly consuming raw garlic as part of their diet were 44 per cent less likely to suffer from lung cancer.<br />\nEven when they allowed for whether people smoked &#8211; the biggest single cause of lung cancer \u2013 the scientist found garlic still seemed to reduce the dangers by around 30 per cent.<br />\nAround 40,000 people in England and Wales are diagnosed with lung cancer every year, and it is the deadliest form of the disease.<br />\nSmoking is thought to cause at least 80 per cent of cases and fewer than one in ten sufferers are still alive five years after their diagnosis.</p>\n<p>China is by far the biggest producer of garlic globally accounting for 77% of the worlds production.<br />\nEvidence that people who eat garlic are more likely to escape cancer comes from a comparison of garlic eating in two Chinese counties in Shandong province.</p>\n<p>Gangshan County residents eat about 20 g. of garlic a day (about seven cloves) and have a gastric cancer death rate of 3.45 per 100,000 population.</p>\n<p>In nearby Quixia County, the residents care little for garlic and eat it rarely; they die of gastric cancer at the rate of 40 per 100,000.</p>\n<p>The non-garlic eaters have an almost twelve times greater risk of deadly gastric cancer.</p>\n<p><strong>Should we eat raw or cooked garlic?</strong><br />\nAlthough numerous studies have highlighted certain health benefits from eating raw garlic, they have yet to determine whether or not cooked garlic might possess the same capabilities.<br />\nGarlic has to be raw to kill bacteria, boost immune function and probably help prevent cancer. But cooked garlic can lower blood cholesterol and help keep blood thin and perform as a decongestant, cough medicine, mucus regulator and bronchitis preventive.

There are two main types of diabetes. In Type 1 diabetes the cells of the pancreas stop making insulin. In Type 2 diabetes, either the pancreas cells do not make enough insulin, or the body&#8217;s cells do not react properly to it. This is known as insulin resistance.</div>\n<div>\u00a0<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/image18.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-800\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/image18.jpg?w=300&#038;h=168\" width=\"300\" height=\"168\" /></a></div>\n<div>How does the body control blood sugar levels?</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Your body uses blood sugar (glucose) for energy. Glucose is a basic ingredient of sweet foods such as sweets and cakes. It can also be produced by carbohydrates such as potatoes, pasta or bread when they are digested and broken down.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Under normal circumstances, the hormone insulin, which is made by your pancreas, carefully regulates how much glucose is in the blood. Insulin stimulates cells all over your body to absorb enough glucose from the blood to provide the energy, or fuel, that they need.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>After a meal, the amount of glucose in your blood rises, which triggers the release of insulin. When blood glucose levels fall, during exercise for example, insulin levels fall too.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<p>Types of diabetes and how they cause health problems.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/image22.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-806\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/image22.jpg?w=300&#038;h=108\" width=\"300\" height=\"108\" /></a></p>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div><strong>Type 1 diabetes</strong> is an autoimmune condition, and the immune system attacks the cells of the pancreas. It tends to affect people before the age of 40, and often follows a trigger such as a viral infection.</div>\n<div>I have diagnosed several younger diabetics that have presented with abdominal pain and vomiting or with thrush or abscesses \u00a0or during pregnancy. On closer questioning they admit to loss of weight( 10lbs/4.5kg unintentional weight loss) excessive thirst and frequency of urination with fatigue.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<div>If people living with Type 1 diabetes don&#8217;t receive treatment they can develop very high blood sugar levels &#8211; hyperglycaemia &#8211; within days. As I remember being taught as a medical student in the days, when we were drilled like army cadets, the consultant Dr Byron-Evans proclaimed in a loud, authoritative, deep Welsh \u00a0voice ,&#8221; Now, good boys ( female medical students were an unusual presence-and not really recognised in those days!) this is the most important of medical emergencies be aware of it as it is slow to happen, undramatic \u00a0but potentially fatal&#8221;. How could I forget, I \u00a0tremble as I write this!</div>\n<div>This occurs because \u00a0there is no insulin to drive the sugar from the blood into the cells, the kidneys try to remove the excess glucose. This leads to frequent urination, dehydration and intense thirst.At the same time, the body starts breaking down fat for fuel to counter the low levels of sugar available to the cells. This leads to toxic levels of acids building up in the blood &#8211; a life-threatening condition known as ketoacidosis.</div>\n<div>\u00a0As we screen so readily now, and attempt to improve patient education diabetics presenting with hyperglycaemic ketoacidosis is less common but it still happens.</div>\n<div>\u00a0About 16 years ago I remember seeing an \u00a018 year old boy who came to the surgery \u00a0with his sister in an embarrassed state as he had thrush \u00a0and after testing his urine I diagnosed diabetes. He looked at me petrified and said &#8220;Am I going to die?&#8221; to which I replied ,&#8221; I hope not for a long time&#8221; . He was started on insulin and the diabetes was brought under control. He moved away from Ealing but recently I bumped into his sister in a local supermarket \u00a0and asked how he was. Indeed, he was well, \u00a0living a normal life and had never been admitted to hospital.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Those with Type 1 can also suffer a dangerous complication of treatment known as hypoglycaemia, which can cause a coma. This occurs when blood sugar levels fall dangerously low as a result of taking too much insulin, or sometimes by skipping a meal. The brain requires a constant supply of glucose from the blood otherwise it can&#8217;t function properly.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<p>If treatment doesn&#8217;t effectively control high blood sugar levels, it leaves a person with diabetes more vulnerable to infections. Over time it can also damage the small blood vessels and nerves throughout the body, including the smaller vessels at the back of the eye, which can result in blindness, and the kidneys, leading to kidney failure.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/image23.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-807\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/image23.jpg?w=300&#038;h=108\" width=\"300\" height=\"108\" /></a></p>\n</div>\n<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/image24.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-808\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/image24.jpg?w=266&#038;h=190\" width=\"266\" height=\"190\" /></a></p>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div>In <strong>Type 2 diabetes</strong>, either the pancreas cells do not make enough insulin, \u00a0and it has been shown that when someone is diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes up to 50% of their pancreas is damaged \u00a0ie the beta cells are not functioning or the body&#8217;s cells do not react properly to it and this is known as insulin resistance.</div>\n<div>The exact mechanisms that lead to Type 2 diabetes are not fully understood, but an underlying genetic susceptibility is usually present. This could be a family history of the illness, for example. The condition is then triggered by lifestyle factors &#8211; such as obesity &#8211; and it usually appears in people over the age of 40.</div>\n<div>\n<div>Type 2 diabetes tends to develop more gradually, which is one of the reasons why medical professionals think that so many cases go undiagnosed.</div>\n<div>Most Type 2 diabetics are overweight but there \u00a0are some elderly patients who present in the same way as Type 1 diabetics by losing weight, excessive thirst and urination.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>In the long-term, diabetes raises the risk of many conditions, including peripheral vascular disease (when the arteries to the extremities are damaged by atherosclerosis) and peripheral nerve damage. Together they can result in ulcers, infections, gangrene and amputations. It can also increase the risk of impotence, heart attacks and strokes.\u00a0Over time it can also damage the small blood vessels and nerves throughout the body, including the smaller vessels at the back of the eye, which can result in blindness, and the kidneys, leading to kidney failure. On a dialysis unit the majority of patients are diabetics.</div>\n</div>\n<div>Cataracts are also common in diabetic patients.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div><strong>Gestational Diabetes</strong> &#8211; During pregnancy, some women experience heightened blood sugar levels and can&#8217;t produce enough insulin to absorb it all. In most cases it develops between the 14th and 26th week of pregnancy, known as the second trimester, and disappears after the baby is born.</div>\n<div>The mother and baby has to be closely monitored \u00a0during and immediately after delivery. She may need to take insulin during the pregnancy. A specialist diabetologist usually oversees this alongside the obstetrician .

You can get your daily exercise done without having to spend extra time or money at the gym. The simple act of riding your bike can burn between\u00a0<a href=\"tel:750%20%E2%80%93%201000\">750 \u2013 1000</a>\u00a0calories an hour, which helps both your health and fitness.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Several years ago a study was carried out by Diabetes UK whereby one group of people were strongly encouraged to exercise and another group were given no advise. The trial was to last 4 years and it was aimed at establishing \u00a0the importance of exercise in Diabetes prevention . After 2 years the trial was abandoned as it was found that it was shown \u00a0so strongly that exercise did prevent diabetes it was considered unethical not encourage everyone to exercise.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Recently when I was trying to help some 4th year students,who have to carry out a study looking at health prevention, it did cross my mind to look at those people who use public transport and see how many were overtly obese as the impression is that there noticeably \u00a0less obese people traveling on the underground. Hence, I was not surprised by the results.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>They found wide variations in the modes of travel used in different parts of the UK. Public transport was used most in London, at 52 per cent, while only 5 per cent used it in Northern Ireland.</div>\n<div>Of the working-age adults who used \u00a0private transport such as cars, motorbikes and taxis to get to work, 19 per cent were obese, compared to 15 per cent of those who walked and 13 per cent of those who cycled.</div>\n<div>The researchers said people could reduce their risks of serious health problems such as heart attacks by avoiding using a car.</div>\n<div>Anthony Laverty, from the School of Public Health at Imperial College London, who led the research, said: \u2018This study highlights that building physical activity into the daily routine by walking, cycling or using public transport to get to work is good for personal health.</div>\n<div>\u2018It demonstrates associations between active travel to work and a reduced likelihood of being overweight, having diabetes and having hypertension.\u2019</div>\n<div>Robin Hewings, of Diabetes UK, said the charity \u2018recommends that the best way to reduce your risk of Type 2 diabetes is by combining physical activity with a healthy balanced diet that is low in salt, fat and sugar and rich in fruit and vegetables\u2019.</div>\n<div>He added: \u2018Walking to work is a great way to improve your overall health and we recommend people walk where possible in place of a car or public transport.\u2019</div>\n<div>A study by Leicester University earlier this year found those at high risk of developing diabetes can reduce the likelihood by cutting the time they spend sitting by 90 minutes a day.</div>\n<div>&#8220;We are recommended to have at least 30 minutes&#8217; moderate exercise a day so only a 15-minute walk at either end and you have done your quota &#8212; although the longer the better,&#8221; Millett said. &#8220;It&#8217;s also more convenient than going to the gym because it can be factored in as part of your day without having to set aside any other time.&#8221;</div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>All new patients are screened by urine testing but if you are concerned that you have symptoms of weight loss, thirst and frequently passing urine please ask for a \u00a0special blood test.

I was in a friends house and staying for the first time and found myself having bowel incontinence &#8211; it came without warning as I stood up in my friends sitting room. Thankfully she was incredibly kind and only showed concern and helped me sort myself out and has never mentioned it since.One of my patients who has severe Crohn&#8217;s disease had been turned down for a &#8216;blue badge&#8217; and she had described severe bowel incontinence so after this episode I made a strong appeal which was upheld.

Mortality in developed countries is about 1 in 1,000 cases (1%). In populations with high levels of malnutrition and a lack of adequate healthcare, mortality can be as high as 10%.</p>\n<p>In cases with complications, the rate may rise to 20\u201330%.<br />\nAccording to the 2011 United Nations Millennium Development Goals report, &#8220;the combination of increased immunization coverage and the opportunity for second-dose immunizations led to a 78% drop in measles deaths worldwide. These averted deaths represent one quarter of the decline in mortality from all causes among children under five.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Even in countries where vaccination has been introduced, rates may remain high. In Ireland, vaccination was introduced in 1985. There were 99,903 cases that year. Within two years, the number of cases had fallen to 201, but this fall was not sustained.</p>\n<p>Measles is a leading cause of vaccine-preventable childhood mortality.</p>\n<p>Worldwide, the fatality rate has been significantly reduced by a vaccination campaign led by partners in the Measles Initiative: the American Red Cross, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the United Nations Foundation, UNICEF and the WHO.</p>\n<p>Globally, measles fell 60% from an estimated 873,000 deaths in 1999 to 345,000 in 2005. Estimates for 2008 indicate deaths fell further to 164,000 globally, with 77% of the remaining measles deaths in 2008 occurring within the Southeast Asian region.</p>\n<p>Measles is an endemic disease, meaning it has been continually present in a community, and many people develop resistance. In populations not exposed to measles, exposure to the new disease can be devastating.</p>\n<p>In 1529, a measles outbreak in Cuba killed two-thirds of the natives who had previously survived smallpox. Two years later, measles was responsible for the deaths of half the population of Honduras, and had ravaged Mexico, Central America, and the Inca civilization.</p>\n<p>In roughly the last 150 years, measles has been estimated to have killed about 200 million people worldwide.</p>\n<p>During the 1850s, measles killed a fifth of Hawaii&#8217;s people.[62] In 1875, measles killed over 40,000 Fijians, approximately one-third of the population. In the 19th century, the disease decimated the Andamanese population.<br />\nIn 1954, the virus causing the disease was isolated from an 11-year old boy from the United States, David Edmonston, and adapted and propagated on chick embryo tissue culture. To date, 21 strains of the measles virus have been identified.<br />\nWhile at Merck, Maurice Hilleman developed the first successful vaccine. Licensed vaccines to prevent the disease became available in 1963.An improved measles vaccine became available in 1968.</p>\n<p>On a personal level several experiences in my life as a doctor in the UK and in Africa and a mother of three children I value the importance of vaccination.</p>\n<p>I distinctly remember talking to my Mathematics teacher when I was in the 6th form at school and knowing I was wanting to study Medicine she told me about her 7 year old daughter who was in an institution as she had contracted Measles and was now severely brain damaged following encephalitis, a rare and very serious complication of measles.<br />\nIt had an impression on me and over 20 years later, when I had the choice to vaccinate my own children there was no hesitation but at that time only a single injection was available ( MMR was not available) and only about 66% protection.<br />\nUnfortunately, my son was one of the 33% who was not protected after the single injection and he contracted Measles caught from a child who had a mild infection but not immunised and he had to be hospitalised.<br />\nLater all my children and husband contracted Mumps and they were all unwell , my son and husband had the complication of orchitis (inflammation of the testicles) and my eldest daughter had a mild encephalitis. Fortunately, they all recovered but it was a very stressful time, so that when the MMR was introduced I felt totally committed to encouraging mothers to have their infants immunized and was never convinced of the association with autism or bowel disease.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, I had spent time in Nigeria where Measles is a significant cause of death in infants as well as my first hand experience of seeing children with serious complications or death, in all other diseases for which we now vaccinate infants.</p>\n<p>I consider it is ethically unacceptable to tolerate any serious complication, or death, from measles or any other disease when an effective vaccine is available.<br />\n<strong><br />\nWe vaccinate for the following reasons:-</strong><br />\n1) the protection of the individual child to protect them from a disease which could lead to serious complications or death.<br />\n2) as part of creating a herd immunity to protect other individuals who are more vulnerable ( children and adults treated for cancer or who are immuno-suppressed for other reasons) and as part of the worldwide programme to eradication of these diseases.</p>\n<p>Due to vaccinations, we no longer see smallpox, and poliomyelitis is heading towards eradication. No wonder vaccination is considered a modern miracle.<br />\nVaccination is one of the greatest breakthroughs in modern medicine. No other medical intervention has done more to save lives and improve quality of life.<br />\nHopefully we will never see what my first practice nurse told me how she had nursed rows of children in iron lungs due to the affliction of Poliomyelitis &#8211; a scene shown below. When I first joined the practice I regularly saw a patient who had survived this experience as a child and still had assisted respiration machine for the nights and was unable to walk &#8211; he attended surgery by mobility car and then transferred to a wheelchair to attended and had kept down a full-time job.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/image.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-751\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/image.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/vaccinations/Pages/vaccination-saves-lives.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/vaccinations/Pages/vaccination-saves-lives.aspx</a></p>\n<p><strong><br />\nARE YOUR CHILDREN UP TO DATE WITH THE MMR?</strong></p>\n<p>We are running a catch up programme in Ealing for 10-16 year olds and any other children who for whatever reason missed out on this important vaccination .

In the US, rotavirus-related hospital admissions have fallen by as much as 86% since the vaccine was introduced.<br />\nIt will be administered as a 2 dose oral vaccine.</p>\n<p>SHINGLES<br />\nShingles is caused by the same virus as chickenpox, herpes varicella zoster and occurs when the dormant virus is activated.</p>\n<p>The illness affects the nerves and skin.

But there are some symptoms that could be caused by gastrointestinal disease, for which you need to see a doctor.As I thought about this blog I noticed that when I was doing my out of hours sessions that more than 50 % of those attending the Urgent Care Centre were complaining of abdominal pain with or without vomiting or bowel symptoms. They are anxious \u00a0and fearful and \u00a0attend at all hours</div>\n<div>One father attended with his daughter who had come home from school gone to the fridge, drunk cold milk and the had instant abdominal pain. The father put her in the car and rushed her to A&amp;E worried she might have had a serious reaction.<br />\nThere are those that attend who have eventually plucked up courage to admit they are experiencing significant problems.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\u00a0\u00a0Many people appear within an hour of vomiting and very concerned about starving and nearly always ask the \u00a0question &#8220;when can they eat?&#8221;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div><strong>To understand our gut we need to start at the beginning&#8230;.</strong></div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/image43.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-856\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/image43.jpg?w=300&#038;h=151\" width=\"300\" height=\"151\" /></a>It starts at the mouth and the desire for nourishment starts the moment we are born. I remember my third child, who was &#8216;born in the car&#8217; on her way to the hospital, \u00a0within minutes off birth was rooting for food and indeed she had her first feed \u00a0before she arrived at the hospital. I was also ravenous after delivery and enjoyed not only my breakfast but my husbands aswell. He was driving and \u00a0lost his appetite as he had the task of sorting out the car and caring for the other two children.</div>\n<div>\u00a0I now understand why when I \u00a0witnessed my first births in Africa that the women always rushed to the entrance gate of the hospital to get food from the food sellers after they had delivered.</div>\n<div>This illustrates how there is an instinctive need to eat, \u00a0but in times of fear and anxiousness(fight and flight) the desire goes away. We all know that lack of appetite before an examination or important social occasion.</div>\n<div>The mouth is an important entrance to the gastrointestinal tract and it should guarded carefully<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/image41.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-854\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/image41.jpg?w=291&#038;h=300\" width=\"291\" height=\"300\" /></a><br />\nNow less people are in touch with their bodies they lose that instinct and eat out of habit rather than real need . Plates are piled high and many feel they have to finish every morsel whether they need to or not. We often don&#8217;t give ourselves enough time to eat and think carefully what we are eating and \u00a0whether the plate is \u00a0showing a balanced diet and whether our body actually needs it. There is an argument for saying grace at the beginning of a meal,as I remember in school, to allow the body to prepare itself for eating, activating the salivary glands and reflecting on what was to be eaten and starting the pace leisurely rather than leaping forward like an Olympic runner aspiring to win the race. Saliva not only lubricates the food but also contains enzymes that start chemically digesting your meal and special chemicals that help bacteria causing infections. Teeth break down large chunks into smaller bites. This gives a greater surface area for the body&#8217;s chemicals to work on. Recently articles have appeared in the press talking about a study of brain samples from deceased dementia patients and how unusually high levels of Porphyromonas gingivalis, a type of bacteria which causes gum disease were found.<br />\nAlthough the bacteria live in the mouth, they can enter the bloodstream during eating, chewing, tooth brushing or dental surgery, and potentially reach the brain, experts explained.<br />\nInflammation caused by gum disease-related bacteria has already been linked to various health problems including diabetes, heart disease and stroke.<br />\nResearchers say they have uncovered how bacteria may set off a chain reaction leading to bowel cancer.<br />\nFusobacteria, commonly found in the mouth, cause overactive immune responses and turn on cancer growth genes, two US studies reveal.<br />\nDental care has deteriorated due to dental costs to patients and less care taken by individuals regarding dental hygiene and poor diet.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/image45.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-858\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/image45.jpg?w=284&#038;h=177\" width=\"284\" height=\"177\" /></a><br />\nIf you haven&#8217;t visited the dentist recently perhaps this will be a good promptThis is the link for our local dentists in and around West Ealing :-</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/Service-Search/Dentists/W138la/Results/12/-0.319475322961807/51.5176773071289/3/0?distance=25\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.nhs.uk/Service-Search/Dentists/W138la/Results/12/-0.319475322961807/51.5176773071289/3/0?distance=25</a></p>\n<p>The same link can be used to find dentists throughout England.</p></div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/image46.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-859\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/image46.jpg?w=295&#038;h=171\" width=\"295\" height=\"171\" /></a>It is so important to introduce chewing foods at an early age as this encourages the appropriate muscles to work together around the mouth and jaws and to stimulate \u00a0the production of saliva containing enzymes to. break down food into a \u00a0more digestible form.

Metallic tastes in the mouth may occur in women at the start of pregnancy, individual taking antibiotics, or those with a zinc or vitamin B12 deficiency.<br />\nThe tongue is important manipulating food in mastication and in phonetic articulation of speech.<strong>Lips</strong> are a visible body part at the mouth of humans.

The food then enters the digestive system and the important nutrients are digested.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/image50.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-877\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/image50.jpg?w=300&#038;h=240\" width=\"300\" height=\"240\" /></a><br />\nIn the mouth the tongue pushes food to the back of the mouth and through the act of swallowing passes into the muscular tube called the oesophagus ( from the Greek meaning entrance to eating and often referred to as the gullet) The oesophagus releases mucus to lubricate food and muscles push the meal downwards by peristalsis into the stomach.<br />\n<em>A patient came into this week very concerned that she was having a tube put into her sarcophagus(is a box-like funeral receptacle for a corpse)did that mean things were very serious! She was due to have an endoscopy so I was quick to reassure her that things were not that bad.</em></p>\n<p>The stomach is a j-shaped organ found between the oesophagus and duodenum. Its main function is to help digest the food you eat. The other main function of the stomach is to store food until the gut is ready to receive it. You can eat a meal faster than your intestines can digest it.</p>\n<p>Digestion involves breaking food down into its most basic parts. It can then be absorbed through the wall of the gut into the bloodstream and transported around the body. Just chewing food doesn&#8217;t release the essential nutrients, so enzymes are needed.</p>\n<p>The wall of the stomach has several different layers. The inner layers contain special glands. These glands release enzymes, hormones, acid and other substances. These secretions form gastric juice, the liquid found in the stomach.</p>\n<p>Muscle and other tissue form the outer layers. A few minutes after food enters the stomach the muscles within the stomach wall start to contract (tighten). This creates gentle waves in the stomach contents. This helps to mix the food with gastric juice.</p>\n<p>Using its muscles, the stomach then pushes small amounts of food (now known as chyme) into the duodenum. The stomach has two sphincters, one at the bottom and one at the top. Sphincters are bands of muscles that form a ring. When they contract the opening, the control closes. This stops chyme going into the duodenum before it is ready.</p>\n<p>It is when this process goes wrong that problems occur. Almost everyone knows what it feels like to have indigestion also known as dyspepsia,heartburn or nausea. The Chinese call it reversal of Qi as stomach Qi should descend. This should occur as a \u2018one-way\u2019 movement but reflux can occur when food or drink travels back up from the stomach and into the oesophagus. This is not the same as vomiting, which is a violent reaction, reflux can occur without people even realising. At the lower end of the oesophagus, there is a ring of muscle which is there to stop reflux. This generally works efficiently &#8211; when we eat or drink, the muscle relaxes but it then tightens up when we have finished. However, if the muscular ring gets too slack, reflux can occur. If reflux occurs repeatedly, it may lead to oesophagitis \u2013 inflammation of and damage to the lining of the oesophagus. In most cases, there seem to be no obvious causal factors leading to the slackening of the oesophagus\u2019s muscular ring, although eating an excess of rich, fatty foods does seem to increase reflux. Treatment generally takes the form of medication \u2013 although lifestyle modifications can help too.<br />\nIt is estimated that 40% of people have a digestive symptom at any one time usually describing one of 4 symptoms:-</p>\n<p>abdominal pain<br />\nchanges in bowel habit (usually constipation or diarrhoea)<br />\nindigestion<br />\nheartburn</p>\n<p>Hence, it&#8217;s not surprising that when I sit in an out of hours clinic that so many people present with one of these symptoms.<br />\nMost digestive problems are to do with lifestyle, the foods eaten, or stress. Another common cause is the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs(NSAIDS) such as ibuprofen, aspirin, naproxen or diclofenac.<br />\nTaking steps to change your lifestyle can help, and often prevent, many of these problems. There is a wide choice of pharmacy remedies for heartburn, indigestion and similar problems that are very good for the short-term relief of symptoms but it is interesting that very few of these people have tried anything before they are seen by a doctor.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/image51.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-878\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/image51.jpg?w=214&#038;h=235\" width=\"214\" height=\"235\" /></a><br />\nI remember as a child my father taking either white medicine or sucking white tablets. Then early one morning he was taken by emergency ambulance to hospital and had emergency surgery for a perforated ulcer. He was in hospital for almost 4 weeks and then sent to a convalescence home.<br />\nWhen I was studying medicine and when I qualified this type of patient was not uncommon and I spent many hours holding a retractor assisting surgeons carrying out varied types of surgery, cutting nerves, removing part of the stomach in order to eleviate these symptoms in an emergency or as an elective procedure. Then there was a major breakthrough and drugs such as cimetidine and ranitidine (Zantac) were introduced. These decreased the amount of acid produced and often cured the digestive symptoms. These drugs are now readily available over the counter. However, I remember in the small Welsh town where I worked that the value was such that a doctor and pharmacist were prosecuted for trafficking these drugs to Asia! The doctor was my Registrar so I had instant promotion.<br />\nOne day in 1982 I was reading Scientific American,a favourite journal for many years, and I was drawn to a very interesting article written by 2 Australian scientists who had been examining gastric mucosa for many years and they had observed a bacterium called <strong>Helicobacter pylori</strong> was frequently seen (in 80% of specimens)but assumed to be insignificant but they were the first to show that it played a part in the formation of ulcers. Individuals infected with H. pylori have been shown to have a 10 to 20% lifetime risk of developing peptic ulcers and a 1 to 2% risk of acquiring stomach cancer.</p>\n<p>The Helicobacter pylori enter the stomach and attach to the protective mucus lining of the stomach wall. The bacteria are able to survive in the strongly acid environment of the stomach because they excrete the enzyme urease which neutralized the acidic environment of the stomach by converting urea into the basic ammonia and buffer bicarbonate. Inside the mucus lining of the stomach wall, the bacteria cannot be killed by the bodies immune system.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/image54.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-885\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/image54.jpg?w=292&#038;h=300\" width=\"292\" height=\"300\" /></a><br />\nThe Helicobacter pylori produce toxins such as vaculating cytotoxin A (VAC A) that cause the cells in the lining of the stomach to die. This allows the bacteria to better access of nutrients as it decreases the competition from stomach lining cells.<br />\nThe bacteria invade the protective inner lining of the stomach so that they can be protected from immune system. The bacteria then kill the cells that they invade which creates holes in the mucus lining of the stomach, causing the formation of ulcers. Additionally, the substances released by the bacteria during the invasion, hurt the stomach cells ability to absorb calories from food in the stomach.<br />\nThis is the reason why patients with stomach ulcers and cancer can lose significant amounts of weight.<br />\nAt least half the world&#8217;s population are infected by the bacterium, making it the most widespread infection in the world.<br />\nIt used to be said that in the developed World that the prevalence of infected people increases with age and is the same percentage as age &#8211; 50% of 50 year olds were infected but this is now changing.<br />\nIn 1979 the first of a new class of drug, omeprazole that controls \u00a0acid secretion in the stomach (proton pump inhibitor-PPI) was discovered.<br />\nOnce H. pylori is detected in a person with a peptic ulcer, the normal procedure is to eradicate it and allow the ulcer to heal. The standard first-line therapy is a one week &#8220;<strong>triple therapy</strong>&#8221; consisting of proton pump inhibitors such as omeprazole and the antibiotics clarithromycin and amoxicillin. Variations of the triple therapy have been developed over the years, such as using a different proton pump inhibitor, as with pantoprazole or rabeprazole, or replacing amoxicillin with metronidazole for people who are allergic to penicillin. Such a therapy has revolutionized the treatment of peptic ulcers and has made a cure to the disease possible; previously, the only option was symptom control using antacids, H2-antagonists or proton pump inhibitors alone.<br />\nNow, the modern medical student or junior doctor will have never seen surgery for this condition and the majority patients are treated and cured in the community.</p>\n<p><strong>It is important that anyone aged 55 years and older with unexplained and persistent recent-onset dyspepsia alone should also have endoscopy.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/image55.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-888\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/image55.jpg?w=150&#038;h=150\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>Also alarm signs at any age such as<br />\nweight loss,<br />\nvomiting,<br />\nhaematemesis,( vomiting blood)<br />\nanaemia<br />\ndysphagia<br />\nrequire urgent referral for endoscopy.<br />\n</strong></p>\n", "post_id": 871, "location": false, "date": "08-23-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Health", "WHO", "Flu immunisation", "health benefits", "children's health"], "text": "<p>After several years of acquiring good evidence from other countries the Department of Health now recommend that all children aged two to 17 are going to be offered a flu immunisation every year.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/image52.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-881\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/image52.jpg?w=300&#038;h=213\" width=\"300\" height=\"213\" /></a> At present, annual flu immunisation is offered only to children with underlying health problems, as well as all over 65s and anyone with long term health conditions such as heart and lung disease or diabetes.</p>\n<p>The Chief Medical Officer for England says that even if only one in three children are immunised, hospital admissions will drop by 11,000 and 2,000 lives will be saved each year.

There were just seven beds and in the first year 131 patients were admitted. One of the benefactors was Charles Dickens.<br />\nThirteen years later, a site in City Road was purchased from the Dyers&#8217; Company and the almshouses that occupied it were converted to a 25-bed hospital. This was opened on St Mark&#8217;s Day, 25 April 1854, and took the name of St Mark&#8217;s Hospital for Fistula and other Diseases of the Rectum.<br />\nBy the 1870s, ever-increasing demands on the Hospital caused rebuilding to be considered. The adjacent site, occupied by rice mills, was acquired but could not be developed for some years due to lack of funds. Eventually, building began and in January 1896 the &#8216;New St Mark&#8217;s&#8217; was opened. There was considerable difficulty in meeting the costs of maintaining the new building and it was the entertainment industry that finally came to the rescue. Lillie Langtry organised a Charity Matinee at her theatre in Drury Lane and the Hospital was saved. In 1909, the name of the Hospital was changed for a second time to St Mark&#8217;s Hospital for Cancer, Fistula etc.,<br />\nSt Mark&#8217;s was taken over by the new National Health Service in 1948.<br />\nSt Mark&#8217;s remained part of the Barts NHS Shadow Trust (later Barts NHS Group) until April 1994, when the changes envisaged by the Tomlinson Report came into force. At this point, Bart&#8217;s joined with the Royal London and the London Chest Hospitals to form the Royal Hospitals NHS Trust (later Barts and The London NHS Trust).<br />\nSt Mark&#8217;s became part of the North West London NHS trust and moved to the same site as Northwick Park Hospital. The hospital maintains strong teaching ties with Imperial College School of Medicine.</p>\n<p>I hope now on the final day of Love your gut week by reading these blogs about the gut and using the links suggested you will be better informed as to improve the health of your guts and be aware when something is wrong and seek the appropriate help. </p>\n", "post_id": 890, "location": false, "date": "08-25-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Lewy body dementia", "Dementia", "Health", "elderly"], "text": "<p>This was largely organised by The Alzheimer Society to help make people aware of this condition which affects at least 750,000 and many people remain undiagnosed and the incidence is predicted to rise to 1 million by. 2021. </p>\n<p><strong>What is dementia?</strong></p>\n<p>The term &#8216;dementia&#8217; is used to describe the symptoms that occur when the brain is affected by specific diseases and conditions.

This means that as confused  as a person may seem those who know this person will still recognise the person underneath and feel a connection.<br />\nMy mother recently died at the age of 94yrs with Lewy Body Dementia following a slow decline over 6years. My sister &amp; I found that talking to her as our mother telling her what was going on kept her as part of the family to the end and even if there was no recognition there was some connection.</p>\n<p>She must have been aware she was deteriorating as she had been proactive in getting her affairs in order and had even been looking at sheltered accommodation. The diagnosis at that time was slow and confused and often doctors and nurses thought she was being lazy or difficult. She had frequent falls and several admissions and when given certain medication especially painkillers or if she had an infection she became very confused and<br />\nwas hallucinating believing the place was flooded and she was stranded and pleased to see me come to the rescue. I understood that this was not my mother and I had to explain to medical staff who assumed that was her character.  It was very frustrating as the proper diagnosis evolved very slowly . I was later to find out that many doctors were not familiar with  type of dementia characterised by </p>\n<p>Although,  when I talked about an impending grand daughters wedding she said to me with a twinkle in her eye &#8220;yes I know you are getting married and what&#8217;s more if you don&#8217;t marry him I will!&#8221;<br />\nAfter all when we were cutting her cake on her 90th birthday that she was marrying one of the residents but only for a year! </p>\n<p>We made a life album with photographs of her whole life so that those caring for her had some idea of the life she lived and who had been important to her in her life. Often she referred to relatives and friends who had died many years ago so that it gave good talking topics when any family visited.<br />\nShe had been living alone but when she was diagnosed she had lucid moments when we were able to discuss her future with her and reluctantly she was admitted to a specialist Care Home.<br />\n We were able to furnish it with her own furniture including the bureau contains photos and items she had saved over many years and a corner cupboard of trinkets that held many memories of holidays abroad and gifts from friends and family.<br />\nShe took her own clothes , although I did find her trying to swap some with a neighbouring resident or offering her 1/6d (old money) for a dress of hers.<br />\nMoreover,she continued to carry her handbag and we took her to buy new clothes as she had always been particular the way she dressed and in her last few months we bought her some new clothes and cheap jewellery and it was a joy to see her face.  She continued to have her hair &#8216;set&#8217; weekly until her last week.<br />\nWe bought her make up and she loved it if any of the granddaughters put on her makeup or manicured her nails and  wouldn&#8217;t change from &#8216;burnt orange&#8217; lipstick.  The grandchildren took their boyfriends/ girlfriends to meet her and she gave her approval often flirting with the boys and giving the advise she had given me as a teenager! She impressed them by demonstrating how she could &#8216;down a shot&#8217; with a small cup of lactulose ( one way of getting her to take her medicine when she refused)  She developed fears she was being poisoned (a common feeling in this disease) so we bought M&amp;S sandwiches as she had implicit faith in their food -it worked!<br />\nShe had always loved the garden and when the carers wouldn&#8217;t let her out she claimed they had put hosepipes on to pretend there was rain. Luckily I arrived in time and she was distracted and proceeded to tell me my brother-in-law had been put in prison for stealing a lot of money &#8211; \u00a377.33 but I was able at that stage to tell her that she was confused and this was untrue and it was her illness and she gave me some insight as to how distressing things could be. That is why it was so important to visit to let her and the carers know what was fact rather than confusion.</p>\n<p> Understandably, some people find it difficult to visit as what they see is too painful and as doctors usually we respect that ( you can&#8217;t take the person out of the illness )<br />\n and it can be difficult to come to terms with this condition.   Sometimes carers and those around a relative can offer more care and love than the relatives for all sorts of reasons and we as doctors try not to be too judgemental as we are often aware of those reasons. </p>\n<p>When a well meaning carer sent me this video.

Latterly she was unable to walk so we used a wheelchair to take her out, the grandsons often wheeled her and she loved them doing wheelies and  the last photos are with the family she loved laughing, singing but gradually these occasions became less and less she slept more until one day she went to bed said goodnight  with the pictures of her two new great grandsons by her side and passed away peacefully. We played her favourite music and put on her favourite perfume and with hair &#8216;set&#8217; and make up on she died in dignity.</p>\n<p>More information concerning Lewy body Dementia</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.lbda.org/content/intro-to-lbd\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.lbda.org/content/intro-to-lbd</a>.</p>\n<p>We had many times of anguish sometimes felt the doctors were being unhelpful and wanted to hasten her end  Sometimes they were very empathetic and supportive. The carers were variable some cared better than others just like real life and as a family we learnt so much and witnessed how care of  patients  with Dementia has improved considerably.<br />\nWhen they are first diagnosed it may be appropriate to fulfill certain ambitions. My mother wanted to go to Weymouth as it had many happy memories for her and she had a wonderful day on the beach , paddled in the sea,ate ice-cream and talked about those happy days when we were all children. She wanted us all to be together as a family and we arranged this on several occasions.<br />\nIt is so important if possible that the family keep in touch let carers know about the life of that person and fight for their dignity, plan their future whilst they can have a say and as the rainy day has arrived for them spend the money on what makes them happy and comfortable don&#8217;t hesitate , arrange to fulfill those ambitions as far as possible.  </p>\n<p>There are escorted holidays at accessible holiday centres arranged by the organisation Vitalise</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.vitalise.org.uk\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.vitalise.org.uk</a></p>\n<p>Many places have gatherings for carers and the patient with Dementia eg the Royal Academy has an afternoon where they discuss great masterpieces with them &#8211; the Art student who told me about this said that the patients with Dementia were totally inhibited and their remarks proved to be both amusing and honest! </p>\n<p>Eventually their horizons shrink and they prefer to remain their home environment and  need simple comforts. </p>\n<p>Written by Dr Jacqueline Bayer </p>\n", "post_id": 90, "location": false, "date": "05-31-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["lifestyle", "7 point scale", "ABCDE", "Health", "Melanoma", "Skin cancer", "Red flags"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/image64.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-911\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/image64.jpg?w=259&#038;h=194\" width=\"259\" height=\"194\" /></a>\u201cAnd so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees, just as things grow in fast movies, I had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.\u201d<br />\n\u2015 F.

I knew his wife well and she attended very regularly and in passing had often remarked about her husbands dislike of doctors. Infact, the only notes on his record were a record of his childhood immunisations.<br />\nOne day, on a Friday evening she appeared very anxious and said her husband had taken to his bed upstairs, because if he even attempted to move he was very short of breath and he had refused to call a doctor. Understanding her predicament and always enjoying the challenge of sorting out a difficult patient I decided to visit him. When I entered the house climbed the stairs, there was David in bed, sitting up with at least 5 pillows and so breathless he was unable to voice his disapproval of my presence. When I examined him more closely he was extremely swollen with fluid to the level of his waist- totally waterlogged!<br />\nI gently suggested a hospital admission and needless to say he summoned up enough breath to refuse outright. In situations like this negotiations are on a par with making a peace treaty between warring countries. After a while we negotiated a plan helped with the knowledge that his first grandchild was due &#8211; he would take the medicines I prescribed and if they worked he would attend the surgery on Monday morning before the doors &#8216;opened&#8217;, I would take blood and he would go to the hospital for a chest X-ray. If he was no better he would have the option of deciding the next move. We shook hands on this and I arrived Monday morning wondering if he was alive or dead and whether he would appear. I was not long in the surgery when the bell went and in walked David with his wife and I have say hardly breathless and a look of submission on his face.<br />\nI had the X-ray form prepared and proceeded to take blood. As he rolled up his sleeve there before me on his forearm a classical, fulfilling all criteria malignant melanoma. I remained calm as one must with a patient like this as they are likely just to get up and leave precipitantly.<br />\nAfter his remark of &#8220;is that it,doctor?&#8221; I retorted with ,&#8221;not quite, you did say you would go and have a chest X-ray and perhaps Hammersmith would be a better hospital for you and by the way could you just pop in to this clinic whilst you are there!&#8221; I quickly scribbled a note for the Walk-in skin clinic hoping that I was right in thinking I had him in my hand and that he would arrive at the clinic and not have to wait.<br />\nLater that day his wife phoned to tell me that he had done everything I had suggested and he had been admitted but was wanting to take his own discharge. The hospital doctors had made the diagnosis of malignant melanoma with spread to the lungs and heart failure. He had refused all treatment except what I had prescribed.<br />\nHe soon came home and was told he was terminal. I visited him and even after lengthy discussion he was adamant that he was not going to have any treatment for this cancer. The Macmillan nurse arrived and he dismissed them as he could manage his own death and he had a lot of things to sort out and he didn&#8217;t have enough time to talk to nurses and doctors. The first most important thing to do was to phone the council and have the large tree removed from the family grave as the grave  would be needed very soon &#8211; he felt it was disgusting how graves were looked after.<br />\nThis was done by the council in record time.</p>\n<p>David never appeared at the surgery again, failed to attend hospital follow ups but continued to take the medicines I originally prescribed. I kept in touch when his wife attended and she collected his medication. I only ever saw him across the road when he was on his way to the graveyard with his trowel and bucket to carefully maintain the grave. He would always wave and shout over , &#8220;How are you, doctor?&#8221; to which I would reply,&#8221;Fine , how are you?&#8221; and he would retort,&#8221;Fine&#8221; and continue about his business. He not only enjoyed the birth of his grandson for 4 other grandchildren and lived for almost 5 years of a good quality life but finally quite suddenly he died to go to the grave he had so lovingly tended.</p>\n<p>The point of this story is that for some reason this tumour can become inexplicably dormant but then recur at a later stage even years later.</p>\n", "post_id": 909, "location": false, "date": "08-25-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["loneliness", "ducklings", "Social interaction"], "text": "<p>Social interaction appears to be an extremely important part of ducklings growing up.<br />\n<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/azc8JDuRCUw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></p>\n<p> The ducklings are now visiting us on a regular basis and there seem to be a variety of visitors including ducklings of mixed race or in the duck world known as hybrids.

The early trial conclusions state that social interaction helps to make people healthier and live longer.</p>\n<p>This has also been found in other studies including Cacioppo, who found lonely people show a number of adverse cardiovascular changes compared to people with friends. They have faster heartbeats, higher blood pressure and poorer sleep. So this closely mirrors McClintock\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p>There is also good evidence that social support has a favourable influence on a wide range of illnesses including heart disease, cancer, hypertension and respiratory disorders.</p>\n<p>However, good social interaction is a key part of living well. Study after study lists good friendships, family relationships and health as the most important things to have in order to be happy and fulfilled.</p>\n<p>As doctors we are always interested in a patients social network and I can recall numerous cases to illustrate this.<br />\nHowever, I also feel that being in our own space is extremely important and can be extremely beneficial in some instances.

When I bought my plants I was advised by an elderly couple who were buying a plant each to put on their windowsill. I was surprised when I ended up with a red variety and a yellow variety. But research showed me that the yellow variety is richer in antioxidants than the red. <a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/image1.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-934\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/image1.jpg?w=259&#038;h=194\" width=\"259\" height=\"194\" /></a> Lycopene is a carotenoid pigment that has long been associated with the deep red colour of many tomatoes. A small preliminary study on healthy men and women has shown that the lycopene from orange- and tangerine-colored tomatoes may actually be better absorbed than the lycopene from red tomatoes. This is because the lycopene in deep red tomatoes is mostly trans-lycopene, and the lycopene in orange/tangerine tomatoes is mostly tetra-cis-lycopene. In a recent study, this tetra-cis form of lycopene turned out to be more efficiently absorbed by the study participants. <a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/image2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-935\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/image2.jpg?w=138&#038;h=150\"   /></a></p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t realise the antioxidant protection as being important for <strong>bone health</strong>, but according to a study carried out whereby Lycopene was withdrawn from postmenopausal women&#8217;s diet for 4 weeks and after this short period of time there were increased signs of oxidative stress in their bones and unwanted changes in their bone tissue implying that tomato lycopene (and other tomato antioxidants) may have a special role to play in <strong>preventing osteoporosis.</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/image3.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-936\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/image3.jpg?w=150&#038;h=101\" width=\"150\" height=\"101\" /></a></p>\n<p>Intake of tomatoes has long been linked to <strong>heart health</strong>. Fresh tomatoes and tomato extracts have been shown to help lower total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides. In addition, tomato extracts have been shown to help prevent unwanted clumping together (aggregation) of platelet cells in the blood &#8211; a factor that is especially important in lowering risk of heart problems like atherosclerosis. Dietary intake of tomatoes, consumption of tomato extracts, and supplementation with tomato phytonutrients (like lycopene) have all been shown to improve the profile of fats in our bloodstream. Specifically, tomato intake has been shown to result in decreased total cholesterol, decreased LDL cholesterol, and decreased triglyceride levels. It&#8217;s also been shown to decrease accumulation of cholesterol molecules inside of macrophage cells. (Macrophage cells are a type of white blood cell that gets called into action when oxidative stress in the bloodstream gets too high, and the activity of macrophages\u2014including their accumulation of cholesterol\u2014is a prerequisite for development of atherosclerosis.)</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image114.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-517\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/image114.jpg?w=150&#038;h=58\" width=\"150\" height=\"58\" /></a>Anti-Cancer Benefits</strong></p>\n<p>Tomatoes have repeatedly been show to provide us with anti-cancer benefits. The track record for tomatoes as a cancer-protective food should not be surprising, since there is a very large amount of research on tomato antioxidants and a more limited but still important amount of research on tomato anti-inflammatory nutrients. Risk for many cancer types starts out with chronic oxidative stress and chronic unwanted inflammation. For this reason, foods that provide us with strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory support are often foods that show cancer prevention properties.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/image4.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-937\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/image4.jpg?w=150&#038;h=112\" width=\"150\" height=\"112\" /></a> <strong>Prostate cancer</strong> is by far the best-researched type of cancer in relationship to tomato intake. The jury verdict here is clear: tomatoes can definitely help lower risk of prostate cancer in men. One key tomato nutrient that has received special focus in prostate cancer prevention is alpha-tomatine. Alpha-tomatine is a saponin phytonutrient and it&#8217;s shown the ability to alter metabolic activity in developing prostate cancer cells. It&#8217;s also been shown to trigger programmed cell death (apoptosis) in prostate cancer cells that have already been fully formed. Research on alpha-tomatine has also been conducted for non-small cell lung cancer, with similar findings. Along with prostate cancer and <strong>non-small cell lung cancer, pancreatic cancer and breast cancer </strong>are the two best-studied areas involving tomatoes and cancer risk. Research on tomatoes and breast cancer risk has largely focused on the carotenoid lycopene, and there is fairly well documented risk reduction for breast cancer in association with lycopene intake.</p>\n<p>In multiple studies other health benefits associated when tomatoes included in the diet include reduced risk of some <strong>neurological diseases (including Alzheimer&#8217;s disease)</strong>.

She was delighted to tell them how she had been a kitchen maid since her early teens in the &#8216;big house&#8217; owned by the dentist, but then wanted to leave and the only way out was to marry the footman ; the mistress of the house then told her to leave as she were surely be pregnant in no time!Oh said one of the students does this mean that &#8216;Downton Abbey was based on real life!&#8221;</p>\n<p>Indeed she soon became pregnant and she knew that that when the time came she would be taken to the &#8216;workhouse&#8217;  to deliver and then have to stay on to scrub floors or do other tasks to pay for her stay.  The pregnancy was not going well and she was developing late complications but mysteriously she found that she was being taken to a private hospital and safely delivered and to this day does not know who paid. As my grandmother would have said if anyone had asked &#8216;never you mind&#8217;</p>\n<p>She then went on to describe the horrors of the workhouse and the huge inequality  of health care and then the absolute joy when  on July 5th 1948 health secretary Aneurin Bevan opened  Park Hospital in Manchester, as the launch of a hugely ambitious plan to bring good healthcare to all. For the first time, hospitals, doctors, nurses, pharmacists, opticians and dentists were to be brought together under one umbrella organisation to provide services that would be  free for all at the point of delivery.</p>\n<p>The central principles were clear: the health service would be available to all and financed entirely from taxation, which meant that people would pay  into it according to their means.</p>\n<p><strong>THE NHS WAS BORN</strong></p>\n<p>Much of the story of the NHS is about the interaction of the three main parties involved: those needing care, those who deliver skilled care and those whose task it is to raise the money and see it properly spent. The peculiarly difficult triangular relationship between these interested parties has to be satisfactory if the health service is to function to the benefit of society.  The story goes on if you want read more a fascinating account turn to <a href=\"http://www.nhshistory.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.nhshistory.net/</a></p>\n<p>I embarked on a medical career embracing this vision and trained in Cardiff and South Wales to be proud of a health service which offered this totally unprejudiced care. I worked with men who carved coal out of the bowels of the earth where machinery could not go and as part of my training was taken to the coal face to admire the sparkling diamond-like anthracite coal which man could only gets to on his belly. It took days for me to get clean !! I went the steel works and sweated profusely as I stood for minutes by the blast furnaces watching men that would be there for hours upon end and watch the glistening liquid steel pour out. It was only by seeing this could I fully appreciate the conditions these men worked but how we laughed as they told their tales and still tears come to my eyes when I hear the soulful singing of the Male Voice Choir sing with hywl  and watching &#8216;the boys&#8217; playing rugby with such devotion. Everything  stopped, life was on hold literally only contacting the doctor, even with a heart attack when  the match had finished. Where I worked  Spina bifida had the highest incidence in the World, cystic  fibrosis was not uncommon and of course the lung disease from working underground was rife along with cardiovascular disease.</p>\n<p>It is not surprising it took a Welshman to fight for the a National Health Service and I have to say private medicine barely existed at that time. The miners built the hospital with a Maternity ward. The nurses  were natural nurses: they were brought up to nurse as the majority of families housed at least one sick member.<br />\n What a valuable experience to work in this setting and why I feel so passionate about a national health for all and why it grieves me to see it being abused by &#8216;those same three parties which we always knew had a relationship which would be &#8216;a peculiarly difficult triangular relationship.</p>\n<p>Those needing the care would gradually take less and less responsibility for their own health and their family&#8217;s health. So that when George Bernard Shaw wrote in his preface of &#8216;The Doctor&#8217;s Dilemma&#8217; 100 years ago when he despaired of the private  health care it is ironic that the same despair for different reasons but also aimed at doctors should apply today  after 65years of a National Health Service<br />\n&#8220;If you cannot have what you believe in,you must believe in what you have. When your child is ill or your wife dying,&#8221; when you are confronted by &#8220;the spectacle of a fellow creature in pain or peril, what you want is comfort, reassurance, something to clutch at, were it but a straw. This the doctor brings you. You have a wildly urgent feeling that something must be done; and the doctor does something. Sometimes what he does kills the patient.&#8221; The philosophy of the placebo effect.</p>\n<p>Last Bank holiday weekend a gentleman brought his child to the out of hours clinic in the evening with a non complicated chickenpox. He wanted me to admit the child as he didn&#8217;t want anyone else to catch the disease especially as the extended family with their children had arrived from Leicester and were staying for the weekend. When I tried to explain that this was not necessary as the condition was not serious and it would be totally inappropriate as there are children in hospital seriously ill   (perhaps leukemia ) and contact with them could be be seriously detrimental and even cause death to which he retorted &#8221; couldn&#8217;t you put her in a side room? &#8216; he persisted trying to make me give in but I stood my ground and as he left very annoyed as I had wasted his evening and it had cost him a lot in petrol. When I shared this with my colleagues they proceeded to relate similar stories. Constantly, we see streams of minor medical or social problems which we deal with patiently day after day and then try not to get caught out when the &#8216;real patient&#8217; arrives. To make matters worse our reputation of unconditional healthcare has spread throughout the world and people use it as a stop off place to get free medical care and don&#8217;t appreciate the boundaries.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, many patients use the service with respect and maintain a good working relationship with health professionals and benefit greatly from all the amazing advances in medicine and the service provided. But sadly this does not make news.</p>\n<p>Those skilled workers, doctors,nurses and  other health care workers as part of this service dedicated their lives to providing health care to all. nursing sisters slept in a room on the ward, ruled their ward with pride and a rod of iron. when I was first qualified if I entered a ward I would have report to the sister who would then look me up and down to see  if I was  suitably dressed and my white coat was clean before allowing me near a patient. At the same time there was a mutual respect and the sisters and nurses shared their wealth of  knowledge and knew the patients well and guided  many doctors through those terrifying months of being a newly qualified doctor and rescuing them when they  were unsure and had to be answerable to the consultant.  Ask Mary our practice nurse, she will tell of the many junior doctors she has had to offer guidance and sometimes with great authority and they have obviously benefited as some now hold reputable positions as specialist consultants. But now there is a more liberal approach and there is more antagonism. We have all become preoccupied with status,targets, cost effectiveness, evidence based medicine and  losing sight of the fact we are dealing with individual characters who have lives and stories to tell and how the same illness  can effect different people in different ways.<br />\nHowever, when I talk to doctors in all sorts of situations albeit in hospital, A&amp;E , in practice or in between lectures I am always reassured that for the most part they are &#8216;nice&#8217; people wanting to provide and care  for their patients in the best possible way and this keeps me reassured that for the most part values have not changed.also our medical schools are working hard to reinforce these ideals. But these health professionals are also people and deserve to have a family life and enjoy other aspects of life and I would not advocate bringing back those obscene long hours. Indeed, the modern doctor had taught me a lot about looking beyond the consultation room and I feel it keeps me much more in touch with my patients.</p>\n<p>Those whose task it is to raise money and see it wisely spent have used health as a commodity to be bargained with  and failed to take into account  the services that cannot be measured the hours doctors pass dealing with patients mental health a rising malady which is predicted to be the major cause of illness in the next 5-10 years.  Unlike blood pressure it can&#8217;t be measured or monitored in the same way and when I hear a mere suggestion that patients are to be limited how many consultations they can have each year my hackles bristle at the thought. I used to dread seeing a patient who was depressed and hopeless I instantly adopted the same feeling and then after more experience of life and all that it throws at you I began to feel more confident to support and guide people through a crisis. Moreover, following the advent of safer medication with faster action and less side effects I began to see patients emerge from that black hole and restore their lives which in turn encouraged me to recognise mental illness management as a important part of the treating patients.<br />\nHowever, when I see how our local musculoskeletal service run by GP&#8217;s and physiotherapists has grown from strength to strength and now provides an excellent exemplary service which is totally due to doctors working in partnership with patients and managers. By working together to effectively  manage the service, using local resources, spending wisely  it can work and the patients undoubtedly benefit.</p>\n<p>If only those patients who work so positively with us in partnership and those caring doctors maintain their dedication and good care  and the managers can spend wisely and manage effectively  we could reconnect using that peculiarly difficult triangle to restore a NHS for the 21st century.<br />\nGeorge Bernard Shaw 100 years ago lambasted  the medical profession when he wrote in the preface of his play &#8216;The Doctors Dilemma&#8217; &#8220;Until this body of men and women were trained and paid by the country to keep the country in health it will remain what it is at present: a conspiracy to exploit popular credulity and human suffering&#8221;.<br />\n After reading many statements from Jeremy Hunt accusing doctors particularly GP &#8216;s of causing the chaos in A&amp;E  and reading the Editorial  of this months BMJ &#8220;Let the patient revolution begin&#8221; I felt I wanted to write a blog reflecting on my experience of working in the NHS for &gt; 40 years.<br />\nThe article refers to George Bernard Shaw in his claim of the medical profession having a conspiratory against the laity likening it today where disease and doctor centric health systems that are costly, wasteful, fragmented, and too often uncaring are provoking similar ire.<br />\nIt goes on to say<br />\n&#8220;Clinicians and patients need to work in partnership if we are to improve healthcare and challenge deeply ingrained practices and behaviours. Doing this won\u2019t be easy for either side after eons of paternalism, and many patients will prefer to maintain the status quo.&#8221;<br />\nAlthough I think we need to maintain the original principles we need to exercise  it to be relevant today.<br />\nMany members of the population need to be educated into knowing how to cope with everyday health problems and how to improve their lifestyle to prevent illness. This was voiced by our  patient participation group but again they favoured electronic information as well talks by clinicians. Many patients want to know more about their illnesses and take an active role in making a choice about treatment. No longer can we dictate how to treat a patient but we need to work together .many years ago  I remember prescribing antidepressants which took 3 weeks to work when the patient returned after 10 days feeling no better I (and many other doctors did the same) would say which end of the capsule did you put in your moth first and the tell  the patient to turn it around and come back in 10 days. ( it makes me shudder as I write this) In the article they  quoted American examples of progress but I think we are making changes in our practice which are more relevant today such as the MSK clinics which are GP led and allow patients be seen much quicker than hospital and treated or only referred to specialist consultants. This has saved considerable amounts of money, expanded and most of all has had huge patient satisfaction. During the last year several Integrated care groups have been set up whereby the GP has an extended consultation with a  patient with complicated medical/social problems and often  are frequent attenders at A&amp;E or outpatients. Together  the GP identifies  patient goals and clinician goals  and both work together to achieve these and review after a set time. If  some of the problems are proving difficult to address the case is taken incognito  to a Multidisciplinary meeting which consists of specialist consultants, mental health and social service  professionals and any other appropriate professionals and representatives of a group of practices. These meetings  are held every month and during the last year. We have been discussing  patients &gt;75years and diabetics. During these meeting we have shared our problems of management, poor control of symptoms and control of diseases as well as identifying educational needs for all those attending. Lessons learnt in these meetings can also be used in similar cases.<br />\nBelieve or not getting social services, hospital staff including psychiatrists and GP&#8217;s around the same table has been revolutionary.<br />\nWe now need to educate our patient population. Medical students I teach in their 4th year have to do a project looking at health promotion. The students have looked at smoking cessation,  healthy eating in schools, exercise in the elderly an even how providing socks for the homeless and how this can prevent cellulitis of the legs. We are holding more public health meetings and Sarah Jarvis not only appears on the radio but is up to date with her blogs on current medical concerns <a href=\"http://www.patient.co.uk/blogs/sarah-says\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.patient.co.uk/blogs/sarah-says</a><br />\nThis website is a mine of information and also has an App I do recommend it if you haven&#8217;t found it already.

I arrived with 4 minutes to go before the departure time but the awaiting station uniformed official mercilessly blocked mine and several others entrance to the platform claiming we should be there at least 2 minutes before departure and indeed by the time she had completed her declaration it was just just less than 2 minutes!</p>\n<p>I walked away crest fallen, luckily with a semi-flexible ticket and started to make my way towards the Salle d&#8217;Attente ready for more than one hour&#8217;s wait. On my way I noticed, out of the corner of my eye a cycling machine for charging batteries.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/image17.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-986\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/image17.jpg?w=320&#038;h=240\" width=\"320\" height=\"240\" /></a> I put down my luggage and plugged in my iPad and it wasn&#8217;t long before a young French girl from a small village near Nantes joined me also having missed her train connection. We both began pedaling as if in a road cyclists heaven cycling the French Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es on a challenging climb. (Echoed by passing French young men) then she said that there was no need to pedal so hard, the devices did not charge any faster and we slowed down to a casual pace.<br />\nShe then started to tell me how she had worked as an &#8216;au pair&#8217; for a councillor&#8217;s family in Rochdale near Sheffield. Whilst living there she had worked as a volunteer at a youth club and it was whilst working there that she had gone back to the flat of 2 of the young girls from the youth club. She had been discouraged but felt she had something in common with them as they claimed that they were bored at home and she empathasisec as she been brought up in I small out of the way village in France. When she arrived at the flat she was not unduly surprised to see the disheveled outer appearance after all the outside of her parents farmhouse was not exactly pristine.<br />\nAs she entered the flat she was shocked and surprised to see that it was totally empty except for some bedding strewn on the bare floorboards, no doors, no electricity and only cold running water. Her look of surprise prompted the girls to admit that both parents were drug addicts and they had sold every possession and use the doors as firewood to make an open fire to cook and keep warm. What do you do to occupy yourself the French girl asked and they told her how they played cards by candle-light and listened to the radio when they acquired batteries.<br />\nFollowing this experience she went back to France and studied Political Sciences and now involved in French Politics.</p>\n<p>We the talked about social deprivation and poverty and she felt is was because in Britain we had not had a Revolution and didn&#8217;t appreciate the concept of Libert\u00e9,Egalit\u00e9 &amp; Fraternit\u00e9 and tended to concentrate our efforts on Liberty(freedom).<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/image18.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-987\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/image18.jpg?w=625&#038;h=333\" width=\"625\" height=\"333\" /></a><br />\nMore importantly after this experience she had phoned her mother to apologise for complaining about being brought up in a boring simple village on an ordinary farm!<br />\nIt was not long before we noticed that 45 minutes had passed and we parted with devices charged and in separate directions to try to make some difference in society.</p>\n", "post_id": 980, "location": false, "date": "09-23-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["stress", "anxiety", "mindfulness", "Mental health", "Health", "meditation", "Depression"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/image19.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-992\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/image19.jpg?w=275&#038;h=183\" width=\"275\" height=\"183\" /></a></p>\n<p>Have you ever felt that your mind is over full, cluttered with so many thoughts and worries that you almost feel your head is about to explode?</p>\n<p>Moreover,have you developed techniques to deal with this?</p>\n<p>This need has been recognised since the beginning of time and I feel as soon as we become aware of the world outside ourselves as a child we instinctively know how to do this. Unfortunately, children are not encouraged or nurtured to preserve this skill and many modern toys are brightly coloured and noisy and the opportunity to just &#8216;be&#8217; and enjoy stillness and silence and the simple life around them is missed.</p>\n<p>One of the best pieces of advice I was given when I had my first child was &#8216;if the baby cries remember she may just want to be put down&#8217; and it often worked.</p>\n<p>Several years ago I talked to a group of 5-6 year olds about being quiet and still and I was surprised when most of them revealed how this was something in their own way they found a way of practising. They then proceeded to tell me how they found space to do this. &#8220;I always go under my sisters bed,&#8221; said one child. &#8220;I go in the garden behind the shed&#8221; said another.&#8221; I sit under the stairs&#8221; said another.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/image40.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1034\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/image40.jpg?w=300&#038;h=137\" width=\"300\" height=\"137\" /></a></p>\n<p>I then sat with them and focused on a candle, which I allowed one of them to carry to the table. The child who was the noisiest and most active carried it with great care and placed it on the table. I spoke with these children on several occasions and on each occasion a child carried the candle a short distance to the table and we all sat in silence. Week by week the length of time they remained silent and still grew until they were able to sit quietly for up to 5 minutes. Following this they came out of the silence quieter and played together in a much calmer, friendlier manner.</p>\n<p>Similarly, talking to children in a a quiet monotone causes absolute relaxation and puts them in a state of self hypnosis. This technique I have used on many occasions to administer injections and take blood from children. On one occasion when I was a junior paediatrician and a child was admitted with an asthma attack. The nursing staff were lining up to hold him down to put up a intravenous infusion. The child was distressed and frightened. I asked the staff to leave the room and quietly spoke to him with full eye contact and gradually the child quiet ended and he cooperated fully to allow me to put up the infusion much to the surprise of the nursing staff.<br />\nOn another occasion more recently I was working as a locum in a practise and a mother came to the surgery with 3yr old active twins. She was distraught as her husband had terminal cancer and she had no-one to look after the children and wanted to talk about her own problems. When I looked at the computer notes there were four entries from previous doctors recording that they were unable to have the consultation with the mother and she should return on her own. I started to talk to the twins and then gently massaged the centre of their scalp (a calming acupuncture point) and both children stood still for long enough for the mother to pour out her concerns. The children were then led calmly away by their much calmer mother.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/image41.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1035\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/image41.jpg?w=300&#038;h=177\" width=\"300\" height=\"177\" /></a> <a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/image42.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1036\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/image42.jpg?w=300&#038;h=300\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<p>As an adult to achieve this level of relaxation we need to focus on a sound, a picture or simply your own breath sounds and may need help from another person.<br />\nUsing techniques like this, meditation, breathing and yoga can help us pay attention to the present moment. It helps us become more aware of our thoughts and feelings so that instead of being overwhelmed by them, we\u2019re better able to manage them.<br />\nThis awareness of the present moment or Mindfulness as a psychological concept is based on the concept of mindfulness in Buddhist meditation. It has been popularised in the West by Jon Kabat-Zinn. Despite its roots in Buddhism, mindfulness is often taught independently of religion.<br />\nMindfulness teaches individuals to be present in the moment rather than being distracted about the past or projecting into the future. It doesn\u2019t stop you feeling emotions per se, but it does allow you to deal with them more dispassionately.</p>\n<p>Practising mindfulness can give people more insight into their emotions, boost their attention and concentration and improve relationships. It\u2019s proven to help with stress, anxiety, depression and addictive behaviours, and can even have a positive effect on physical problems like hypertension, heart disease and chronic pain.</p>\n<p>Mindfulness practice, is increasingly being employed in psychology to alleviate a variety of mental and physical conditions.</p>\n<p>I think that mindfulness is something many of us have done &#8211; have you ever sat looking out to sea and found yourself listening to the rhythmic sound of waves or watching the trees/ grass swaying in a breeze or listening to your favourite music and suddenly realised that time has passed and for a short time you were only aware of that present moment and following this you feel more at ease. Have you swum lengths in a swimming pool with gentle rhythmic arm and leg movements and your mind taking up by feeling of movement in the water and finished the swim feeling that problems have seemed less or gone. Jogging at a gentle rhythmic pace around the park in a similar vein can give the same effect. This is not overexerting the body but calming the mind in a similar way to yoga. However, the benefit is only appreciated by being aware of the present moment and your thoughts and emotions at the time.<br />\nThis can be a start to achieving full awareness or mindfulness by zoning in on the feeling of relieving the mind of excessive, overwhelming clutter so that eventually you can reach mindfulness with perfect stillness of body and mind.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/image44.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1038\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/image44.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/image45.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1039\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/image45.jpg?w=300&#038;h=235\"   /></a><br />\nAlthough the practise of meditation is in no way a religion it may be it is part of your religious practise and you need to be aware of how it can be helpful physically and mentally; you may want to call it prayerfulness.</p>\n<p>I have been surprised as to how many people from all walks of life benefit from regular meditation although it is now it can be referred to as mindfulness.</p>\n<p>Mindfulness. If you\u2019re not yet au fait with the concept, it might be a good idea to familiarise yourself with it now, because you\u2019ll be hearing a lot about it in 2013; from business leaders, academics, politicians and educationalists.</p>\n<p>It is also being introduced into some schools as part of the curriculum.<br />\nI read an account of a school that played music and instructed the schoolchildren that when played they were to stay still and think about themselves. After a while the head teacher only had to start the music and the whole school became quiet.<br />\nMindfulness is being increasingly recognised as an incredibly effective way to cope with stress and also recognised by NICE and the NHS as the most effective way to prevent relapse into depression and anxiety states. It has been found to help with pain management and weight loss.</p>\n<p>It has been discussed in Parliament as a therapy in relation to both unemployment and depression. But it isn\u2019t about zoning out. If anything, it\u2019s about zooming in; paying attention to the present and decluttering the brain to make room for creativity \u2013 and in business that means boosting the bottom line.</p>\n<p>To that end, mindfulness training has been embraced by organisations as diverse as Google, Transport for London, PricewaterhouseCoopers and the Home Office, by way of an antidote to the relentless pressure and information overload common in many workplaces.</p>\n<p><strong>HOW CAN YOU MAKE A START IN THE PRACTISE OF MINDFULNESS</strong></p>\n<p>1) Make it a formal practice. You will only get to the next level in meditation by setting aside specific time (preferably two times a day) to be still. At first it maybe for only 3-4 minutes.</p>\n<p>2) Start with the breath. Breathing deep slows the heart rate, relaxes the muscles, focuses the mind and is an ideal way to begin practice.</p>\n<p>3) Stretch first. Stretching loosens the muscles and tendons allowing you to sit (or lie) more comfortably. Additionally, stretching starts the process of \u201cgoing inward\u201d and brings added attention to the body.</p>\n<p>4) Meditate with Purpose. Beginners must understand that meditation is an ACTIVE process. The art of focusing your attention to a single point is hard work, and you have to be purposefully engaged!</p>\n<p>5) Notice frustration creep up on you. This is very common for beginners as we think \u201chey, what am I doing here\u201d or \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just quiet my mind already\u201d. When this happens, really focus in on your breath and let the frustrated feelings go.</p>\n<p>6) Experiment. Although many of us think of effective meditation as a Yogi sitting cross-legged beneath a Bonzi tree, beginners should be more experimental and try different types of meditation. Try sitting, lying, eyes open, eyes closed, etc.</p>\n<p>7) Feel your body parts. A great practice for beginning meditators is to take notice of the body when a meditative state starts to take hold. Once the mind quiets, put all your attention to the feet and then slowly move your way up the body (include your internal organs). This is very healthy and an indicator that you are on the right path.</p>\n<p>8) Pick a specific room in your home to meditate. Make sure it is not the same room where you do work, exercise, or sleep. I may help to use a candle and gentle music or sounds to help you o feel relaxed.</p>\n<p>9) Read a book (or two) on meditation. Preferably an instructional guide AND one that describes the benefits of deep meditative states. This will get you motivated. John Kabat-Zinn\u2019s Wherever You Go, There You terrific very \u00a0good for beginners.</p>\n<p>10) Commit for the long haul. Meditation is a life-long practice, and you will benefit most by NOT examining the results of your daily practice. Just do the best you can every day, and then let it go!</p>\n<p>11) Listen to instructional tapes and CDs.</p>\n<p>12) Generate moments of awareness during the day. Finding your breath and \u201cbeing present\u201d while not in formal practice is a wonderful way to evolve your meditation habits.</p>\n<p>13) Make sure you will not be disturbed. One of the biggest mistakes beginners make is not insuring peaceful practice conditions. If you have it in the back of your mind that the phone might ring, your children might wake, or an alarm is about to go off then you will not be able to attain a state of deep relaxation.</p>\n<p>14) Notice small adjustments. For beginning meditators, the slightest physical movements can transform a meditative practice from one of frustration to one of renewal. These adjustments may be barely noticeable to an observer, but they can mean everything for your practice.</p>\n<p>15) Use a candle. Meditating with eyes closed can be challenging for a beginner. Lighting a candle and using it as your point of focus allows you to strengthen your attention with a visual cue. This can be very powerful.</p>\n<p>16) Do NOT Stress. This may be the most important tip for beginners, and the hardest to implement. No matter what happens during your meditation practice, do not stress about it. This includes being nervous before meditating and angry afterwards. Meditation is what it is, and just do the best you can at the time.</p>\n<p>17) Do it together. Meditating with a partner or loved one can have many wonderful benefits, and can improve your practice. However, it is necessary to make sure that you set agreed-upon ground rules before you begin!</p>\n<p>18) Meditate early in the morning. Without a doubt, early morning is an ideal time to practice: it is quieter, your mind is not filled with the usual clutter, and there is less chance you will be disturbed. Make it a habit to get up half an hour earlier to meditate.</p>\n<p>19) Be Grateful at the end. Once your mediation is finished spend 2-3 minutes feeling appreciative of the opportunity to practice and your mind\u2019s ability to focus.</p>\n<p>20) Notice when your interest in meditation begins to wane. Meditation is hard work, and you will inevitably come to a point where it seemingly does not fit into the picture anymore. THIS is when you need your practice the most and I recommend you go back to the book(s) or the CD\u2019s you listened to and become re-invigorated with the practice. Chances are that losing the ability to focus on meditation is parallel with your inability to focus in other areas of your life!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/image46.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1041\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/image46.jpg?w=245&#038;h=300\" width=\"245\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 990, "location": false, "date": "09-28-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}, {"tags": ["Hscic", "Health", "health benefits"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/image8.jpg\"><img class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-948 alignright\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/image8.jpg?w=150&#038;h=93\" width=\"150\" height=\"93\" /></a><br />\nThis week we have been advised to alert all patients to the fact that NHS England is commissioning a modern data service from the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC) on behalf of the entire health and social care system.</p>\n<p>Confidential information from your medical records can be used by the NHS to improve the services offered so we can provide the best possible care for everyone.<br />\nThis information along with your postcode and NHS number but not your name, are sent to a secure system where it can be linked with other health information.<br />\nThis allows those planning NHS services or carrying out medical research to use information from different parts of the NHS in a way which does not identify you.</p>\n<p><strong>You have a choice. </strong></p>\n<p>If you are happy for your information to be used in this way you do not have to do anything.</p>\n<p><strong>If you have any concerns or wish to prevent this from happening, please speak to practice staff or ask at reception for a copy of the leaflet \u201cHow information about you helps us to provide better care&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p>Information about you and the care you receive is shared, in a secure system, by healthcare staff to support your treatment and care.<br />\nIt is important that we, the NHS, can use this information to plan and improve services for all patients.

In Western terms this means that if you are ageing, a cold person, tendency to being overweight, backache, knee pain, breathlessness, constipation and infertility. These type of herbs particularly walnuts can gradually ( over a minimum period of 3 months) improve these problems along with other other lifestyle measures.<br />\nThe Walnut tree is a common sight in the Dordogne,France and it is interesting that it always grows alone or with other walnut trees and has been has been harvested for many years for the nuts or taken to mills to make walnut oil,which is used for salad dressing and is very high in Omega-3 fats with all the health benefits.<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/image37.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1029\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/image37.jpg?w=182&#038;h=130\" width=\"182\" height=\"130\" /></a>The mills are at intervals along the Dronne and are often in the shape of a boat(bateau) and the wiers associated with these mills make exciting canoeing! Most are not in use but there a few which still produce walnut oil. It is possible to take the harvested nuts,after drying them over the winter, to the mill and collect the oil at a later date.Sitting by an open fire cracking nuts in the winter months,watching a good film can be pleasant winter pastime. Old dordogne kitchen tables have large dents in the table surface after years of family nut cracking with a mallet. The new nutcracker is much easier&#8230;<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/image30.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1019\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/image30.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>But since I read about a small study carried out in Californis and written up in the journal Biology of Reproduction suggesting that eating around two handfuls of walnuts a day improves sperm health in young men harvesting walnuts has a new meaning.<br />\nThis study involved 117 men between the ages of 21 and 35, who were divided into two groups. One group added 2.6 ounces (75 grams) of whole-shelled walnuts to their daily diet.<br />\nThe other group continued their usual diet but avoided eating tree nuts. Both groups ate a typical Western-style diet.<br />\nLead author, Prof Wendie Robbins from UCLA&#8217;s Fielding School of Public Health said: &#8220;We found a significant improvement in sperm shape, movement and vitality in men who added walnuts to their diet over 12 weeks.&#8221;<br />\n&#8220;The men who ate no tree nuts saw no change.&#8221;<br />\nThe fatty acids Omega-3 found in these nuts are thought to have helped sperm development. It is not known if this would help improve male fertility.<br />\nAbout one in six couples are infertile, with 40% of these due to a male factor.<br />\nThe researchers say the next step is to work with couples who are attending infertility clinics to determine if placing sub-fertile men, with poor semen quality, on a walnut diet results in better success conceiving.<br />\nWhen I resd this I wondered whether it was a signifant result but Dr Allan Pacey, senior lecturer in andrology at the University of Sheffield said: &#8220;It would be relatively easy to poke fun at studies like this, but there is increasing evidence to show that aspects of a man&#8217;s diet can affect the number and quality of sperm produced by his testicles.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Moreover,all those young men that need to improve the health of their sperm and potentially their fertility</strong></p>\n<p>*Avoid cigarettes and illicit drugs, especially anabolic steroids<br />\n*Avoid exposure to toxins such as pesticides and heavy metals<br />\n*Limit alcohol intake<br />\n*Eat a healthy diet and maintaining a healthy weight<br />\n*Take care to keep your scrotum cool, because heat slows sperm production. Avoid hot baths and hot tubs, wear boxers instead of briefs, and avoid pants that are tight or restrictive.<br />\nAND<br />\nEAT WALNUTS!!<br />\n<a href=\"http://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/image38.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-1030\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://102theavenue.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/image38.jpg?w=150&#038;h=121\" width=\"150\" height=\"121\" /></a></p>\n", "post_id": 999, "location": false, "date": "09-28-2013", "mentions": [], "extracted_features": {}}], "edges": [{"data": [54418305, 49986357, 0, 23981784, 47187377, 60502411, 49986357, 37978860, 49986357, 0, 0, 49986357, 0, 49986357, 0, 0, 49986357, 54676891, 0, 0], "type": "comment", "service": "wordpress"}, {"data": [14956234, 20185121, 22695752, 39163727, 43445463, 49986357, 49986357, 49986357, 49986357, 49986357, 56436891, 41314973, 52745616, 42576777, 53940916, 22830572, 33544430, 41375727, 49865210, 58374278, 47187377, 42576777, 49986357, 48756280, 59093346, 59269727, 23981784, 20185121, 38892576, 57875868, 58713722, 31032752, 58426683, 28336487, 50483865, 58713722, 49986357, 47187377, 60502411, 36422858, 49986357, 49986357, 60502411, 42576777, 60643986, 49986357, 55711819, 13552335, 28230376, 30361232, 49986357, 51222270, 57061671, 64687179, 60502411, 36286516, 36422858, 55295907, 49986357, 64274603, 49986357, 64687179, 49986357, 62793486, 49986357, 38087163, 34263790, 49986357, 51133352, 49986357, 49986357, 60502411, 49986357, 49986357, 49986357, 33544430, 49986357, 964144, 49986357, 34263790, 49986357, 8378871, 37808505, 41908454, 49678678, 51323863, 49986357, 49986357, 51357786, 49986357, 49986357, 46381656, 49986357, 49986357, 39163727, 41908454, 49986357], "type": "like", "service": "wordpress"}], "metadata": {"services": [{"username": "102theavnuesurgery", "display_name": "102theavnuesurgery", "service": "wordpress", "service_url": "https://wordpress.com/", "location": false, "service_id": 49986357, "profile_url": "http://en.gravatar.com/102theavnuesurgery"}]}}
